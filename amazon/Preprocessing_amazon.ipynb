       "['so it is been an interesting first few weeks with the echo and am happy to say echo 2nd gen has finally delivered on its promise of improved sound quality over 1st gen echo, with the 3rd firmware since launch.  if you are confused about a lot of the negative reviews, old firmware is the likely cause of most of them regarding poor sound quality.want to keep this short and spare all the gory details, but there was a bug in the launch version of the firmware, which was fixed after a few days, but the first fix, while satisfying some, was not, in my opinion a full fix and left the mid-range frequencies muted and tinny.  today i noticed that alexa is voice in this unit sounded much more like alexa is voice on gen 1 echo is i own and, after playing some music, suspected they had upgraded the firmware again, and indeed they have.  the current firmware is 592452720 and it is a massive improvement over both the original and updated version 592452420.so i decided to do some more side-by-side comparisons with the gen 1 echo and can honestly say in many areas the sound quality is now actually better than gen 1 echo.  this is how the product should have sounded at launch! if i have any complaints at this point it is that the low-frequencies loudness could stand to be bumped up just a tad.  (better yet, please add an eq feature to the alexa app so users can adjust eq for the room and music type they prefer).  i did my comparisons at volume level 8.  anything above that and gen 1 echo dynamic range starts to break down, while gen 2 maintains quality but does not get quite as loud and gen 1.  it is the right trade off, i would rather it sound good than be louder and sound harsh.  at that volume level i went thru a range of music, streamed over bluetooth, switching between gen 1 and gen 2 devices, and found gen 2 to be an improvement over gen 1 for the vast majority of the music i tried.  i’m impressed with the quality of the audio coming out of this form factor, and impressed how quickly amazon has responded to feedback on the problems. kudos, this echo is a keeper.',\n",
       " '---------------------------update 11/4/2017---------------------------after all the negative reviews and feedback on the poor sound quality of the 2nd generation echo it appears that amazon has taken quick steps to help remedy the issue.  i spoke with an amazon representative on the phone who confirmed that there has been a software update which is rolling out to echo devices.  after getting the update my echo does indeed sound better!  i still would not call it audiophile-quality by any means, but the bass is fuller and the sound is less \"tinny\" overall.to check which software version you have, select \"settings\" on your alexa phone app, choose your echo device, then scroll down the page to where it says \"device software version.\"  the updated version (as of 11/4/17) is 592452420 (previously it was 592452320).you do not have to do anything to get the update; it will be sent automatically by amazon.  you may see the indicator light on your echo will pulse blue as the update is installed.  the representative i spoke with said you may get it more quickly by not using your echo for several hours.  i hit the mute button on mine and received the update within a few hours.  i am very impressed by amazon is quick response to this issue!-----------------------------original review-----------------------------as a very happy owner of three echo dots (2nd generation) i was glad to see amazon release a 2nd generation of the echo as well.  after using it for several days i can say i am quite pleased with it, and even though it does not have any radical new features compared with the 1st generation echo or the echo dot, there are some notable improvements.  i will summarize these differences first and then describe the new echo in a bit more detail.improvements over the echo 1st generation:- more color and texture choices- a swappable outer shell- ability to output audio to another device or stereo system via bluetooth or an auxiliary cable- dolby-powered speakers- significantly lower price!differences from the echo dot (2nd gen):- larger size and swappable outer shell (these are probably obvious)- 2 speakers (tweeter and woofer) vs. 1- power adapter sits flatter against the wall---------------------------overall appearance---------------------------i purchased the \"heather gray fabric\" version.  the cloth is a polyester woven fabric made up of lighter and darker shades of gray which certainly gives it more visual interest than if it were just a solid, uniform gray.  the neutral color blends in with nearly any decor, and the cloth gives it a softer look which is great for areas of your house where you do not want something that screams \"i am a device!\"in terms of size, the echo 2nd generation is almost the same diameter (3.5\") as the 1st generation echo (3.3\"), but it is several inches shorter.  to me the original echo looked like a tower; this shorter version is much less ostentatious.the top of the device is identical to the 2nd gen echo dot: it has four buttons (volume up, volume down, microphone off, and an \"action\" button), a multi-colored light ring around the edge that tells you about the echo is status, and seven tiny holes below which the microphones sit.a new feature of this echo is its swappable decorative shell.  simply press a button on the underside of the device and the shell slides right off, allowing you to replace it with any of the other shells that amazon sells.  i am not sure how many people will take advantage of this feature given that additional shells are $20-30, but it could be useful if you want to change your echo is look to match a different location in your home.a final note on appearance: the power adapter for the echo sits fairly flat against the wall, protruding maybe 1.5\".  by contrast, the dot is adapter sticks out from the wall 2-3 inches.  the flatter adapter of the echo is nice if you want to plug it into an outlet that is behind a piece of furniture.--------------------audio quality--------------------i did a side-by-side comparison of the 1st and 2nd generation echos, and despite the new dolby-powered speakers i did not notice a significant difference in sound quality with either music or spoken text.  i certainly would not call it \"room filling sound\" in any case.  clarity is not bad, but bass is nearly non-existent.  however, the real potential improvement in sound quality comes not from the speakers themselves but from a new feature for 2nd generation echo devices: using bluetooth or a 3.5mm auxiliary cable (not included), you can play the audio through a nearby speaker or stereo system.  yes, this does means you are using two devices to accomplish one thing, but in a sense it is no different than plugging any other sound source into your stereo system.  to be honest, i do not generally think of the echo primarily as a music playback device anyway other than for very casual listening (but i realize that puts me in a minority... admittedly i am a bit of an audiophile).compared with the echo dot, however, there is a noticeable difference in sound.  this should not be a surprise given that the echo has two speakers (a tweeter and a woofer) while the dot has only one.  to my ear the difference is not so much in clarity but rather in fullness.  with two speakers and a bit more acoustic \"heft,\" the echo is sound has more presence than the dot is, which to me makes it more tolerable to listen to for a period of time.  the difference is even more appreciable with music than with newscasts or other spoken text.-------------------------voice recognition-------------------------this is one area where i must confess i am disappointed.  like the 2nd generation of the dot, the echo 2nd generation uses seven microphones beneath its top surface to recognize voice commands spoken from any direction.  my wife and i both found this echo to be slightly less proficient at detecting our voices and recognizing vocal commands than our dots are.  we did side-by-side comparisons of the echo and the dot in several locations around our house and the dot was nearly always better at picking up our voices (and yes, we only had one plugged in at a time!).  i am not sure why this would be since both devices use similar technology, but the difference was pretty consistent.  one possible explanation i can think of is this: both devices have their microphone openings on their top surfaces, effectively pointing upward.  because the echo is taller than the dot, if you put both devices side by side and speak to them from several feet away, your voice will hit the dot is microphones at a slightly more downward (i.e., direct) angle than the echo is, which may help the dot pick up your voice better.  obviously i am only speculating here, but in support of this theory i have noticed that both devices have difficulty detecting my voice if i speak from below them (for example, if i am sitting on the floor and the device is on a table).-------------------functionality-------------------the bottom line is that overall functionality -- what the echo 2nd generation \"does\" -- is nearly identical to the 1st generation echo and the dot.  keep in mind that the alexa assistant software on which all echos operate is run on amazon is cloud, not your individual device.  this means that as amazon adds features to alexa they automatically become available on all echo devices.  so, you can use any of them to:- stream music via wifi from multiple sources- control smart home devices- make hands-free calls to other echo devices or phone numbers in north america- make purchases from your amazon prime account- listen to news feeds, podcasts, etc.- do anything else in alexa is ever-growing skill set, such as make shopping lists, set timers/alarms/reminders, play games, tell you your daily schedule, and any other skills amazon dreams up for alexa in the future.personally i have two favorite alexa skills: the flash briefing and the drop-in feature.  the flash briefing is fully customizable daily \"digest\" of news and other information which you can hear any time by asking \"what is my flash briefing?\"  there is a huge list of content you can add to your briefing including news updates, weather forecasts, sports and traffic updates, and educational snippets along with many that are just humorous or entertaining.  using the alexa phone app or your echo account page you can select exactly what content you want in your briefing and in what order you want to hear it.  for example, i configured mine with npr news, bbc news, the weather, and a word of the day.  i love having an on-demand synopsis of the latest news from my favorite sources.my other favorite feature, \"drop in,\" essentially opens a two-way communication channel between any two echo devices, sort of like an intercom.  simply ask alexa to \"drop in on [the living room, the kitchen...]\" and you are instantly connected.  my wife and i use this feature all the time when we need to communicate from opposite ends of the house.  you can turn drop-in capability on or off for each of your echo devices individually, and you can also choose whether each device can drop in with any echo device or only those in your own home.[note that the drop-in feature is not the same thing as alexa is hands-free calling feature.  hands-free calling allows you to call most phone numbers and echo devices in the u.s., mexico, and canada from your echo by saying your contact is name or number.  just like with a phone call, the other person must choose to answer your call before you can communicate.  by contrast, with the drop-in feature communication is instantly established.  for this reason you will probably want to use drop-in only with your closest family and friends, and probably only for certain rooms in your home!] -----------------------------------a few (minor) complaints-----------------------------------unfortunately the echo 2nd gen shares an annoying trait of the echo dot: widely varying volume levels within the daily flash briefing.  as you listen to the briefing, some components (such as one america news) come through quietly while others (like fox news) are much louder.  i do not know whether this variability is due to differences in how each component of the feed is produced or whether it has to do with the device itself, but in any case i hoped the phenomenon would be less pronounced with the 2nd generation echo than it is with the dot.  unfortunately, it is not.  just be prepared to adjust the volume at the beginning of each segment.another complaint i have is the inability to listen to certain feeds outside of the flash briefing.  one america news is an example here: you can listen to the channel is live feed any time, but you can only hear the channel is \"top stories summary\" as part of your flash briefing.  this issue is probably more software than device related, but still, it bugs me.--------------a few tips--------------1) the echo seems to pick up voices best when placed at or below eye level (i.e., roughly the level from which your voice emits).  mine has trouble detecting voices coming from below it, so i do not recommend placing this on a high shelf.2) when you select news feeds for your flash briefing i recommend picking one u.s. source and one international source (i use npr and bbc - both are excellent).  if you add too many feeds you will get a lot of overlap and hear the same story several times.3) if you have multiple echo devices in your home, sometimes speaking to one will cause others to respond as well, especially if they are in close proximity (like in adjacent rooms).  one way to prevent this is to change the wake word of one of the devices to \"echo\" or \"amazon.\"  the only downside is that you then have to remember which wake word you assigned to each device!4) some speakers have a bit of a \"burn-in\" period, so in an attempt to improve my echo is sound i left it playing music for much of the first few days i had it.  the sound did seem to improve a little, (the lower frequencies filled in some), but it is still not stellar.  but if you are not happy with the sound at first, let it play frequently for a few days and it may improve a bit.--------------------------which one to buy?--------------------------if you are trying to decide between the echo and the dot, think carefully about how you plan to use the device.  the single biggest practical difference between the two is that the echo has fuller, better quality sound.  so if you plan to use the device mostly for listening to music, news, podcasts, or whatever, you will probably appreciate the echo is better acoustics.  on the other hand, if you want to use it mainly for voice control of smart home devices, the dot is more than sufficient.  i have a dot in our home theater room that i use exclusively to control the lights in that room.  for that type of single-purpose application anything more than a dot would be overkill.==========bottom line==========although the echo 2nd generation may not have any earth-shattering new features compared with the 1st generation, its significantly lower price and ability to send music to another speaker or stereo system make it a winner.  if you already own a 1st generation echo there probably is not a compelling reason to upgrade because the difference in sound quality is not significant.  but if this is your first echo device you will probably be very pleased with it.  and if you are deciding between the echo and the dot, which one you purchase comes down to how you want to use the device.  for heavy listening, the echo may be preferable for its better acoustics; otherwise, the dot is a great deal -- especially at half the price of the echo!',\n",
       " 'update: amazon has pushed a software update and sound quality now sounds great.i was originally disappointed in the 2nd gen as my original review (below) shows.  shortly after posting the review amazon reached out to me for additional information.  they contacted me again today and said they took my, and others, feedback regarding the sound quality seriously.  the amazon rep informed me my echo was selected to be part of a test group asked me if i would want to install a new software update to address the problem.  she walked me through the steps to ensure the update was applied and asked me to test the audio (she stayed on the phone while i did this).with my 2nd gen and original 1st gen echo in a multi-room group (that is a really nice feature) i had alexa fire up my playlist.  i was surprised to find the 2nd gen now sounded much improved.  as i walked between rooms with the two echo is i was also surprised that the 2nd gen sounded better than my 1st gen, the bass and mid-range had a better quality.  not believing my own ears i had my wife also give it a listen and she agreed.the amazon rep said they were working with a small group of customers like me to verify the update and they would be pushing the update to all customers very soon (update to my update, looks like amazon is now pushing out the software broadly!).  you can check your software version by using the alexa app and looking at your echo device settings. fyi, after the update my gen2 shows device software version 592452420 (the original was 592452320).other than audio, the gen 2 is nearly identical to the original gen 1 with exception of form factor.  the gen 2 is shorter (5.9\") and wider (3.5\").  for comparison gen 1 was 9.2\" x 3.3\".  the gen 2 has many \\'skin\\' options, i chose the fabric option. comparatively the gen 1 had a look of plastic and metal.  the gen 2 cover is removable so you can replace with other skins.as for responsiveness, gen 2 specs show better microphone array.  from my use i have not noticed anything improved. that said i was very happy with the gen 1 responsiveness to commands, the gen 2 continues to be as responsive.all other functions seem to be the same as gen 1 including blue ring that indicates \"listening\", buttons on top to activate for \"alexa\" and button to mute the microphone array. there is also a 3.5mm jack port and bluetooth to connect to other speakers. there is a design change, with gen 1 you would turn the ring to change volume, that is been replaced with +/- buttons (following same design change as the dot releases).---[original review - 1 star]---i bought my first amazon echo back in 2014.  since then i have added a second echo (1st gen), a tap and 3 dots.  i have added vaux cordless home speaker<u+00a0>vaux cordless home speaker + portable battery for amazon echo dot gen 2 gray/ash<u+00a0>to two of my dots.  i have given echo as gifts.  in other words i am all in on amazon echo system and have been for a long time.amazon advertises this as 2nd generation as \"improved sound\".  i thought the original echo (1 gen) sounded great so i fell for the 2nd gen hook, line and sinker.  unfortunately after listening to it i find it is a sinker indeed, or perhaps a stinker.i did an informal test with my 1st gen and new 2nd gen echo.  i had them both play a set of songs.  i am just going by what my set of ears tells me, but the 2nd gen is disappointing when it comes to sound quality.  while it does seem to have a deeper bass, the overall quality sounds tinnier than the 1st gen.  whatever \"powered by dolby\" is supposed to bring to the 2nd get unit is not much, this 2nd gen is just not up to par with the original when it comes to audio.the unit otherwise functions like the original and other than the form factor i see nothing that is an improvement.  i have not seen that it \"hears\" better.  and it does not sound better for sure.perhaps i am too focused on the sound of echo 2nd gen, but when amazon makes it a point to expressly market it as being \"improved sound\", i would expect the sound to be noticeably improved. it does not and therefore give it a 1 star rating.',\n",

       " 'sorry to report this (along with the others i am seeing in the initial reviews) - the echo 2nd gen sound is not as good as the original. bass seems to be cut off at the low end, midrange is weak, lots of emphasis on the high end, overall fidelity seems to be reduced. odd that it is been advertised as \"improved sound\" and \"bose\". i thought this might just be true at low volume, but listened again this morning, running the volume up, and there is a cutoff on the low bass at high volume, too. at the least, it should auto-compensate with volume level - higher bass at lower volume, etc.i think that there is going to be enough static from users that amazon should just admit the problem, pull back the echo 2 now, fix the issue, & replace these first units with revised ones. i wonder who did the beta-testing? the unit is certainly heavy enough to have a large bass speaker magnet .. maybe this can be fixed in software - can amazon update echo equalization via wifi? are the speakers actually high quality?and - they have removed the \"ring\" volume control on top (retaining both the +/- buttons and the voice-activated incremental controls). i only use the ring control on my echo 1 - it is not \"stepped\" - i can set an exact volume.  i miss it already.while we are here, how about fixing things so that all sound intensities (volumes) are the same? alexa is voice, music across the genres, books being read by alexa or by audible folks, \"drop-in\" and ordinary phone calls - fix this so that all have the same sound intensity. as it is now, the drop-in calls are much louder than alexa is voice, for example. also, add a good tone equalizer control within the alexa app while you are at it. and - how about a speed control for alexa is voice when she is reading a book? lots of other text-to-speech gadgets have it - it is a necessity for older folks like my mother (for whom the echo is a great life-enhancer).finally - adding potential injury to insult - who decided to ship the entire batch of pre-orders to be dropped on doorsteps on halloween night? the goblins approach a home but no one is there, see a nice \"treat\" in the big amazon box, and, poof! - magically gone! amazon staff need access to a calendar showing halloween in big orange letters. the preorders were not even supposed to ship until nov. 1.on the plus side: the microphones are probably even better - i can ask alexa to stop or increase volume even while playing very loud music. amazing!  plus, i like the gray cloth cover. and, all of the usual things work very well, including the new \"call any phone by just asking alexa to do it\" feature. it does, in fact, allow calls to phones in the u.s. and canada (and probably mexico) for free. very nice.amazon - just fix the sound, return my sound control ring, put an equalizer in the alexa app and we will be fine. but - do not wait! you are going to have a lot of returns on this one; will probably lose momentum to the competition.i will return my echo 2 and have already ordered its replacement - an echo first gen that was still available on a competitor is site. i do like the echo - a lot! ... just not the 2.',\n",

       " 'i just bought this new model for a room which belonged to my late wife and which has not been used for almost 3 years.  it is quite remote from the rest of the house, so it deserves it is own echo.  this is my 6th echo in a 2,400 sq ft (2 floor) house.  i bought the original echo two years ago then added 4 dots to that and now this handsome new echo.  they all function independently and together (music everywhere !! ... without latency issues).  i probably use all of them for \"smart home\" control (more commands than any other type) of 9 wemo switches, a nest thermostat, and a nexx garage door controller.  i now live alone and it is an extra feeling of security to be able to turn on lights in the house when arriving home after dark.  i have an extra loud doorbell (not wifi controlled) which i would not be able to hear in this newly remodeled room under any circumstances...so my next smart home addition will likely be a wifi (alexa controlled) doorbell (incl. video camera).  my dots all have accompanying jbl bluetooth speakers (however, they are hard wired due to the limitation on bluetooth in a shared network, i.e. \"music everywhere\" only works if speakers are internal or hard wired).  i do not find this to be a big deal.  i am glad that they are bluetooth speakers for travel purposes, but that is not necessary on a day to day basis.  however, i really like the sound of this new unit...it may be just a touch better than the original \"large\" echo (both are superb for the intended purpose).  in this new office and for casual listening the internal speaker is plenty good.  if i \"require\" serious listening, i can play the sound through my media system or high-end stereo speakers if necessary.  i also use alexa for information, stock market reports, flash briefings, frequently for time information when i can not see a clock, and for weather reports.  all of my married children have dots (which i gave them for christmas in 2016), so we are going to be working on setting up telephonic connections very soon.  for me alexa is a voice in an otherwise silent house...a side benefit.  over these past two years she has acquired many skills, but i am not sure she is any smarter with regard to interpreting my statements to her or wishes of her.  but what i do appreciate is that for tasks she performs i do not have to memorize a script to use her.  she responds to natural speech well enough to control all those things i wish to control.',\n",

       " 'edit - updates comments on 11/21/2017:after my initial review (see below these updated comments) expressing my disappointment in the echo 2.0 product and it is poor initial sound quality, to their credit, someone from amazon actually phoned me and told me they acknowledged the problem and were issuing a software update to \"cure\" the problem.  i was out of town and unable to actually use my echo 2.0 that week, so i was curious to see how it sounded when i got back.  it does indeed sound much better, and since then i believe a second software update was sent out.  due to this major improvement, i will be changing my rating from two stars to three.  if they can improve the sound even more through further updates, or take some other action to further satisfy me, i will consider raising it to four stars, but honestly, i am still smarting from my initial experience right out of the box where my jaw dropped in horror at the sound quality.  that was not an experience i am likely to forget about anytime soon.just yesterday i had time to actually listen to a few favorite songs on the unit.  it definitely has more bass than before, and sounds vastly better than it did initially.  that being said, and i noticed this from the beginning, there is split second \"crackle\" in the speaker when playing music ever minute or two.  it is not a deal breaker most likely, but it is definitely disturbing and disappointing to hear this since it does happenfrequently.i am not a perfectionist when it comes to audio, but i think my issue with this product, and i would guess many others, is that amazon prominently mentioned \"improved sound\" when introducing echo 2.0....and it is not.  regardless how \"acceptable\" the sound is now with the two software updates.....it is still not better than the original echo 1.0, which i have had for 18 months and from the start thought has an amazingly rich sound quality.in case anyone from amazon is reading this, the lesson i would take from this is, do not ever promise more than you can deliver.  while i would have found the echo 2.0 lacking in the sound quality area regardless, what made me more disappointed, and yes, even a bit angry, is how you point blank advertised \"improved sound quality\", which is clearly is not.....so far anyway.  if you can do further software updates or other methods to improve the sound....kudos to you, but either way, out of the box, you dropped the ball on this one.to be fair, amazon has provided me with excellent service over the 7 years i have been dealing with them.  i have had them go over the top in taking good care of me on more than a few occasions, and i want to acknowledge that up front.  this is just one case where they definitely did not meet or exceed my expectations.original review below:i am so disappointed!  i have had one original echo (1st generarion) for about 18 month and found the sound to be amazing.  i have purchased two dots since then and hooked up to bluetooth speakers which makes them sound fine.  i was so excited about the echo 2.0 with the \"improved sound\" when amazon announced it.  i received it a few days ago and am totally disappointed in the audio quality.i cannot imagine who at amazon thinks this is \"improved sound\" over the original echo.echo 2.0 looks good.....but the audio quality is awful....period!amazon, for the first time ever you have let me down.  i feel you mislead me and thousands of others with the marketing claim of \"improved audio\" in echo 2.0.make it right, however you decide to do it, just make it right.  perhaps offer to refund half the cost to all purchasers since it sounds closer to the sound quality of dot rather than echo 1.0.',\n",

(why can not multi-billion dollar companies play nicely together?)third, i am not impressed with the sound. i hear no substantial difference from the first gen (i have the most updated firmware as of nov 26, 2017). it does not sound bad, but it is nothing impressive in even a medium sized room. if you are going to claim “improved sound” in the product name, it should be at least a noticeable improvement.fourth, and this is a small quibble, we ordered the sandstone fabric (white) version, to blend in with our decor. why is the cord and plug black? details matter... a white cord with the white device. if you are going to advertise multiple colors to match decor, then make the entire device match.i am hoping that having alexa access in multiple rooms is going to be more useful. the ball is in amazon is court to make these devices really useful, as opposed to just a novelty.',\n",
       " 'historyi own and am happy with the the 1st gen echo.  it serves my life nicely in our kitchen for measurement conversions, timers, weather reports, and the occasional family dance parties when eating snacks and deserts. i was compelled to add more echo devices to my 2017 christmas list after amazon announced drop-in calling and multi-room music features.  i previously used apple is airport expresses to create a multi-room music experience and the idea of using my voice to control my music in multiple rooms was a hard one to pass up.pros+ better sounds than echo gen 1 (as of latest update - post christmas 2017)+ smaller form factory, color, and style (i got the gray fabric) makes it a better looking device than the 1st gen, especially as a stand alone shelf unit (versus sitting next to your other black plastic electronics)+ it performs most of its advertised features pretty well+ multi-room music works great with amazon unlimited and/or spotifyneutral* sound as a whole is comparable to most mid-range price bluetooth speakers. you can not really compare it to a sony or bose, but then again you pay a price for that quality.  sound is pretty much what i expected (maybe even a bit better) for their 80-120 price point* sometimes the echo does not respond when i call for alexa, other times she responds without being prompted.  since this is new-ish technology i give it a pass here as it is features far out-way the occasional hiccup.cons (mostly with new added features, could be improved based on updates or amazon offerings)- 1st gen and echo plus offer the ability to change volume with a large dial built-in to the top of the speaker. this version only has plus or volume buttons (similar to echo dot).  the large dial is far superior to the buttons, in both speed and ease of use when changing volume- intercom or drop-on feature is not that great  when speaking between devices on the same network there is some delay (for today is standard anyway) and on nearly every call whole words or sentences do not get picked up, prompting you to miss some of the conversation. the quality is similar to my cheap ip camera is intercom feature that i use in my kid is room.- multi-room music and amazon is music upload feature (or lack thereof) do not allow you (any more anyway) to stream your personal music library natively through their echo ecosystem. (read more below why this feature changed my mind about owning multiple echo products)why multiple echos will not work for me...i do not rely on any one streaming music service as my only go-to home music choice, i enjoy a variety of artists that may or may not be on certain services. when i added multiple echos to my christmas list i was counting on taking advantage of echo is new multi-room music feature along with amazon is music upload service to play music from my personal library throughout my house.  amazon is music upload service allowed you to upload 250 free songs or thousands of songs for 25 a year.  unfortunately i did not do proper research and found out that amazon had just recently shut down this service (12/2017) which is the only way to play your music through their ecosystem.  while you can use skills such as \"plex\" or \"my media\" to play your library on one speaker, only amazon music and spotify currently support multi-room music. i am disappointed that amazon took this service away right after adding multi-room support. both apple and google offer upload features and if i would had realized this before the christmas season i would have a google home and google home mini under my tree instead. google is home devices offer most of the same features, cost the same, and googles allows you to upload up to 50,000 free songs from your personal collection to google play.conclusionthe echo 2nd gen works as advertised and most people will probably appreciate everything echo has to offer for the price, especially if you are an amazon unlimited or spotify heavy user. however, if you are looking to play your personal library on multiple speakers, this is no longer an option for you.',\n",
       " 'finally broke down and bought an echo (have had firetv stick for a year) and am enjoying it quite a bit. i am reviewing not only the device (echo) but the interface (alexa). mainly useful for playing music, imho -- sound quality is truly great btw -- but drawback is the interface often does not recognize made-up words or words with alternative spellings, which are common in musical songs and albums. for example, while it lists the devin townsend project album z2 correctly as z-squared, it can not seem to find it when one asks it to play. another -- \"apocalypto\" is the title of an old motels album, and again alexa could list it, but seems unable to play it. (workaround - manually create playlists with alexa-recognizable names.)i have yet to get the interface to add anything to my music through verbal command, yet this is something it should be able to do. i find the ability to create playlists via verbal commands to be annoyingly slow, much easier to use the app. i have had similar difficulties accessing order details, get a lot of \"i am not sure what went wrong\" answers.regardless of these inconveniences, the echo and alexa do an incredible job given the short time the device/interface has existed. i look forward to its evolution.',\n",

(read that cell phone with it is own wifi abilities, and bluetooth built in) you will need to download the \"alexa app. \" on that device to set up the alexa products.from that point on, simply plug in the echo device into a regular 110v. wall outlet, it comes with a plug in adapter. there are no batteries in this device, although some have them.  a note here\" yes, you can unplug it without  it losing its brains and requiring repeat set up. so though not specified anywhere i read it evidently has some on board nonvolatile memory built in that will allow this. ( i  spent several research sessions attempting to find this out, and finally had to bite the bullet and just try it. ) i moved it from one room location to another and within a few seconds it greeted me and said it was operational.  now i am only an old guy with pretty good hearing abilities yet, (not exactly an audiophile ) but with dolby digital sound, this is one nice sounding speaker system,fully as good as my 7 speaker altech lansing on my pc. it may even be better.if you have a normal ear, you will be amazed at the sound quality!now i am still learning about this product. every new thing i try i am pleasantly surprised. i plan to get at least a smart home door lock and thermostat to use with it in the future, and several light switches.  i am no great fan of the \"ring doorbell\"  (due to frequently needed battery recharging) at this point, but i understand amazon has purchased that company and will soon have an interface app available to use with the \"ring system\" if you want to keep up with the march of technology, this device is probably your best doorway to that end, since amazon is committed to pursuing it. others may drop out along the way. (new) i made a hands free phone call to my son this moring as a test of the phone capabilities. sound on my end was like he was in the room. the alexa app and it is capabilities are evolving technologies. features will be added. (mine did an update download while playing music) do not be disappointed. it is attractively packed, and very capable, but the \"instructions\" are not detailed and are sketchy. lean about it online as i did before you purchase it. read as many reviews as your eyes and attention span will allow, and take the plunge! an education awaits you!',\n",

       " 'amazon echo is a great device (i was one of the first to have one and waiting for months for my first echo to ship as amazon vastly underestimated the demand for a device like this) and this echo (2nd generation) is a good upgrade from the original. there is no volume ring on the 2nd gen echo like there is on the original echo and the 1st gen echo dot but it is no big deal as there are volume buttons now and the cost of the volume ring was not worth it if you ask me (it was nice, but for most people not worth the money). most of the time you will want to adjust the volume by voice anyway (like \"alexa volume 5\"). i actually prefer the cheaper volume buttons on the dot 2 to the volume ring now.the fact that you can just talk from across the room and it can hear you (most of the time) really sets this apart. if you think you already have an echo because you have siri, cortana, or google, then know that it is just not the same.things i do: set timers, set alarms, get weather info, ask basic questions, listen to music (like prime music, prime stations, songs i bought, etc), listen to radio, ask for jokes, turn things on and off, and i am sure i am forgetting some things. the echo really excels at playing music. i love it than i can ask for a song i want to hear and it will play it (most of the time anyway). at night i often listen to a local radio station and i just say \"alexa stop\" without having to get out of bed when i want to stop listening. if you have multiple echos then you can set up a music group and play the music through all of the echos in the music group at the same time so you can play music throughout the entire house or just downstairs or wherever you want. update: i have ran into some bugs/issues with some echos in a music group not playing music with the rest of the group so that is unfortunate.when i listen to prime station i can tell it \"thumbs up\" if i like the song or \"thumbs down\" if i do not... and when i listen to the station again it will not play the songs that i have thumbed down.using the built-in speaker, the sound quality is quite good for the size and price. a big plus is the addition of an aux output compared to the 1st gen echo. i somewhat wish i could airplay to a device from the echo when i am playing music and want the best sound quality, however bluetooth is pretty impressive when it uses the near-cd quality codecs.positives:* i like the form factor better than the 1st gen - it is shorter and a little wider but feels quite substantial and has a great non-skid rubber or rubber-like base.* the somewhat feature that amazon added (esp - echo spatial perception) so that the nearest echo responds is fantastic. unfortunately there does seem to be a minor downside: the echo is response can sometimes be slightly delayed while multiple echoes figure out which echo is closest and should respond.* it seems to hear better when playing music than the first gen. it was annoying when you would try to talk to it while it was playing but it could not hear you. the new echo hears better during music playback but it is still not \"star trek quality\" hearing; sometimes you may still need to raise your voice.* it is a good buy at the regular asking price and a better buy than the 1st gen echo.* it has a 3.5mm stereo audio jack. sound quality through this jack should be good enough for anyone except audiophiles.* works great and stays connected to my<u+00a0>asus rt-ac68u<u+00a0>router.* if you want to \\'wikipedia\\' something then you can say \\'alexa, wikipedia <subject>\\'. she will read a little from wikipedia. if you want her to read more after she stops then just say \\'alexa, tell me more\\'. this can be useful sometimes.negatives (mostly minor but take note):* while trying out amazon music unlimited with the echo i immediately ran into the issue of the echo playing the explicit version of songs instead of the clean version. there should be an option to never play explicit songs and to play the clean version instead (some people have children). the workaround until amazon addresses this problem is to add the clean song to your music library and then say \"alexa play <song> from my library\".* the android amazon alexa app can be slow and frustrating sometimes. there seems to be opportunity for speed improvement here.* the android app has frustrating editing of text and does not allow you to tap the text in order to place the cursor for editing. i was trying to leave some feedback and needed to go back and edit but i cannot edit anything without deleting everything back to the point where i want to edit. kind of ridiculous and very frustrating. the ios app also suffers from this frustration (actually it seems you can get around it in ios by holding your finger down but why are they making editing text so difficult?).* if you have lights in multiple rooms and echos in multiple rooms then you might think that you could say \"turn on the lights\" and it would turn the lights on in that particular room based on which echo heard the command... but alas, it does not seem possible to do this. you have to name the lights differently, like \"study light\" and say \"turn on the study light\". it is too bad you can not just say \"turn on the lights\" in the study and it will turn on the study lights because the echo that is in the study heard the command.* does not hear well in a noisy environment, or when other people (including on tv) are talking at the same time.home automation:* i use several<u+00a0>belkin wemo<u+00a0>switches to control some lights and fans. they work pretty well although not always perfectly. i also recently added a philips hue system as well.* i can control my honeywell wifi thermostats using the \"honeywell total connect comfort\" skill. i have two downstairs for 2 zones. i have one<u+00a0>honeywell rth9580wf1005/w1<u+00a0>and one<u+00a0>honeywell rth6580wf.* i recently set it up to turn on and off certain activities with a<u+00a0>logitech smart hub. for example, i can say \"alexa, turn on tivo\" and it will turn on the tv and my receiver and set the tv and receiver inputs correctly. i can then use the remote which is synced... and turn it all off with \"alexa turn off tivo\". there were some annoyances getting it all setup but i think it is pretty \"cool\" even though you can only start and stop activities with alexa so you still need the remote to do other things (change channel, adjust volume, mute, pause, etc).* i think i have only really scratched the surface of what is possible with home automation. i have not tried ifttt (\"if this then that\") recipes yet but i hear it is quite powerful and hope to try it out when i have more time to \"play\".wishes:* high-quality digital audio output that is better than bluetooth. if it had this then you could really get high quality audio output from it, but most people probably do not really care that much as analog out is \"good enough\".* smarter. after 2 years i wish the echo was smarter. yes, it has definitely improved over time but google can still answer more questions than alexa. it is going to be hard to beat google in answering general questions.* severe weather alerts. i suggested these alerts a long time ago and they still have not added it to my knowledge... perhaps due to legal reasons? if would be great if it would sound some sort of alarm or notification for severe weather.* built-in support for notifying others that you might need help. this would be good for the elderly. there is a \"ask my buddy\" skill however, but the verbiage is a little awkward (\"alexa, ask my buddy to send help\") and it is free so if the developer decides to stop support then that might leave a lot of people without service at an inopportune time.compared to google home:* setup on google home was super-simple, easier than echo (the android app worked really well and setup seemed streamlined)* google home is smarter for general questions... significantly smarter. i asked google \"how long does it take to get to the honda dealer in lewisville\" and it told me about 26 minutes in current traffic conditions. awesome. the echo totally failed here.* no aux audio output like on echo dot* i prefer saying \"alexa\" to \"ok google\" or \"hey google\"* i currently prefer echo for music and smart home control but i consider google home a serious threat to echo because it is more \"intelligent\" than echoother:* it does not come with a 3.5mm audio cable but i can understand why as many people would probably not use it and amazon wants to get the cost as low as possible so this is not a big deal.* about 10 or 15 minutes after setting it up, it said something like \"your echo received an important update and must restart\". so if you are having issues with it then you may want to give it awhile so it can update if needed.* for better understanding of what you say, go to the alexa app and settings->voice training.while not perfect, i really like the amazon echo. i think the technology and potential is still in its infancy but the echo is already really useful and excels at home automation, playing music, podcasts, and radio. i am giving it 4 stars due to google home being much smarter at answering general questions and due to the negatives i have mentioned above. the echo is a good device but i think you should also seriously consider google home, or maybe even both like i have.',\n",

       " 'i visited my daughter last weekend and she had purchased an echo a week before. i always thought these things were silly and unnecessary. as i work in it security i rolled my eyes at the idea of me installing a \"listening device\" in my house.well, i played with it a couple hours and ordered a dot. the next day i bought an echo too.i am a music lover and its music features alone are what sold me. connected to a free pandora and prime account,  i have lots of music at my fingertips. i am branching into roots music and being new to it i constantly hear new songs. it is a good thing i do not get charged every time i say, \"alexa, who is this?\" and \"alexa, i like this\" which upvotes it in pandora so it learns my tastes. and therein lies its beauty. i can be cooking, reading, cleaning, or anything you can imagine and interact with music services like i had a servant catering to my every desire. on a whim with just a few words. without having to pick up a damn phone or fiddle with knobs.it is not a high end, high power audio system. but i find the quality and volume more than adequate around the house. if i want it louder i can easily plug it in to my home audio system or plug/pair it with my bluetooth speaker...which was twice the price and was not anything but a speaker.as for the security concerns, i just go in the bathroom and turn on the exhaust fan and shower when i want to talk privately. just kidding!! several things made me believe the features were worth the small risk (and everything carries some risk):1. i live alone so it does not have much to hear. but even if i did not i do not think i would be too concerned.2. it is not supposed to send anything to amazon until activated by its attention word (alexa by default). if it ever got out that it was sending sound before that, it might mark the end of the market for these devices. well, maybe not, we are putting up with similar crap from phone os and apps, isp snooping, video surveillance everywhere, web site trackers, etc.3. if it collected credit card numbers or medical information that might put all of amazon or google is home device infrastructure in scope for pci or hipaa compliance. something they would probably prefer to avoid. ;) equifax and probably a dozen other companies already gave away my national password, er, ssn. but i digress.like i said, its capabilities as a versatile, easy, hands free interface to music services is why i bought it (and its low price and wanting to have music more distributed around the house).all its other features are frosting on the cake. i am not particularly interested in home automation but i will probably tinker with it at some point. it might be useful to make and receive hands free phone calls if it can do that. information lookup? bleh. it is not often i want a sound bite answer to anything. voice purchases? probably not. i am likely to order repeat stuff while i am online shopping for other stuff or looking at a menu. and tying voice actuation to a credit card attached account seems like an accident waiting to happen. programming capabilities and routines? i will have to see how powerful the api is. in the back of my mind i am thinking of how it might be useful to tie it to my karafun account and maybe firetv if my ps3 ever dies. or maybe tie it to local event web sites so i can say, \"alexa, what is happening in town tonight?\". maybe it can already do something like that. i do not know. i am a newbie.btw, i bought a second echo. i do not splurge often but having a music genie in another room for $79 was too hard to pass up.why did i buy amazon over google? price. features.i think google will eventually be better at information lookups because, well, they are google. but that feature is low priority for me.',\n",

       " 'i just received and yesterday set up my new echo 2nd generation (\"echo 2\").  until a co-worker sung its (the echo 1 is) praises, i thought this an unnecessary product.  but hearing her and seeing it in action compelled me to purchase one immediately (i actually bought the discounted 3-pack to give the others as gifts).  i could not be more pleased with my echo 2.  first off, setup took merely a few minutes with the app walking me through everything.  secondly, alexa can hear me anywhere in my (modestly-sized) house.  i tested her behind closed doors and understandably she cannot hear me under those conditions.  she is otherwise placed in the middle of my home and i barely raise my voice when i am talking to her from the far reaches of my house.  beautiful!  i have come to learn what questions she can reasonably answer, and what abstract questions she could not be expected to answer.  if you are realistic, you will get almost all of your queries answered by her.  my co-worker had a new dot and showed me that it could make calls!  i told her to call her desk phone and she said, \"alexa, call [her 10-digit number],\" and it rang immediately!  i then realized this was much more than a gimmick and knew it could be used in emergency situations when your cell phone may not be available to you, or if you have fallen or been hurt.  that is what convinced me to get mine (and a few others).i have only had her for a day or so, but am forever impressed with the answers she gives, jokes she will tell, and the fact that i can call people in my contacts list (or a separate phone number i dictate), or simply set a timer, without doing anything more than flapping my lips!  i also have her connected to my pandora music account.  even though i regularly listen to rock music on it through my desktop and high-end audio setup, i find often intone, “alexa, play classical radio,” and am treated to soothing old old-school music throughout my home.  while the sound i get out her obviously does not compare to that of my 100w/channel stereo system, it is extremely impressive just the same.  volume levels are 1-10 and anything over 7 is actually too loud and unnecessary.  in any event, the sound is and can go way beyond what you would consider reasonable background music; and it is crystal clear and sonically beautiful.  i simply did not expect it from this seemingly small and simple device.  i have since been viewing youtube videos on all she can do and am seriously contemplating automating the lights in my home with a hue or wemo setup.  it appears i can do this for an initial cash outlay of maybe $100-$150.the echo 2 is much more than a general \"assistant\" and i can not believe i have waited this long to buy one.  i am 100% unequivocally pleased and know that i have only scratched the surface of what she can do.  also, i do believe i am going to purchase one or two of the \"lesser\" dots, just to keep one next to my recliner in my living room (on one side of my house), and my nightstand (on the other side of my house).  yes, i have said my single echo 2 can hear everything, but i dunno, at two for a c-note, i kind of like the idea of having information i can request and receive at a whisper right next to me too (and i might even put one in my car, tethering it to my unlimited data smartphone).  yes, i guess this all makes me lazy with all the service and convenience, but you know what, i am going to have to say that i am worth it.  at $100 for a single echo 2 (i understand the echo 1 first went for $200, then $179), for this wondrous device that will literally change your life -- this is a complete no brainer.  i guarantee you will love it too!',\n",

       " 'initially i was a bit hesitant in spending this much money on a smart speaker device, but when i saw it at someone is house and just how responsive and intelligent its answers were - i could not resist buying it. i have had it for a few days now, and i have to say its unbelievably good! at the very least, you get a great speaker - the audio (both treble and bass) is phenomenally good - although i have to give a disclaimer - it does really well in a small/medium sized room, but i am not sure of how good the acoustics would be for large rooms or open spaces.alexa: aside from being a fantastic speaker to play your music, there is alexa (now it starts to get exciting!). as a lot of other reviews have mentioned, it can do many things. my personal favorite is the alarm functionality in the morning and that i can just tell alexa to snooze for 5 minutes, or set it up to play a specific genre of music for the alarm. also, the news summary is a great way to start the day, which can be easily had by just asking alexa - whats the news? it can do a lot of standard functions that the smart assistants on phones do - such as call / text/ set a reminder, etc. the game feature (you can play games like jeopardy, song quizz, etc) is fun, and the microphone is really good - such that it can even hear me whisper \"alexa\" when i am near the device, and even when the tv is loud, you do not have to scream to call alexa.other functionalities: pairing with other alexa enabled devices such as light bulbs, switches, and other smart home devices. i have not tried it, but really curious and would probably be getting some of them in the near future.bonus feature (this is really amazing!) : if you are already using the fire stick tv (or are planning to buy one) alexa works seamlessly across the devices, so you can control your tv with the echo using voice. its a game changer. you can just ask alexa to open certain movies or open certain apps, and its that easy. watching prime videos is such a breeze, such that you can start a movie, pause, fast forward, or rewind by just asking alexa on the echo.',\n",
       " 'got this at bb black friday deal.  there is a definite improvement in sound quality over the dot (have 2 of those).  we have this place in our main living area and have since relegated the dots to a kids bathroom and bedroom.if you do not really care about sound, get the dots, but if you like a little richer sound and better bass, get this for not much more. this is not going to beat a surround sound stereo system, but is definitely better than a dot and will appease most users.works well w/ prime music (have not used unlimited subscription, just what comes w/ prime) although it seems you can only have 5 devices connected, so if you have a few kids w/ phones, a firetv, another dot, a tablet etc, you can use up your allotment quickly for music streaming.i have used the calling and drop in features and although they are handy i do have privacy concerns as someboday can just start listening to what is on the other end w/ a drop in.  so i have setup only this device in the main living area to accept drop ins, but the bathroom/bedroom must be called to and i also set them up to only work on my own network.  the way updates work and amazons lack of caring about parental controls on other devices (like allowing any fire device to make a download of any free app despite parental restrictions) i feel this feature could be hacked or an update reset my settings to defaults that are less secure and you figure it out after the fact.i also enjoy the ability to ask alex to play a song \"everywhere\" so it can be playing in multiple rooms and i can her it if moving around the house.we do use the alexa app for setting up shopping orders, nice feature but wish could delete items off a list easier.calendar can now add to outlook.com or gcal so that is nice as welli have not tried a google device but so far am happy w/ this purchase.',\n",

       " 'title is misleading, because i bought the echo for $79 during the holiday sale!!! i am mainly a headphone guy, i have several pairs that get pretty pricey, as well as amplifiers. let me list some pros and cons of the echo.pros:+ compact (small footprint)+/- 360° sound (plays well in a variety of room locations, heard well from everywhere)+ alexa+ stylish designs+ feels well made, not like cheap plastic+ charger and cable feel qualitycons:+/- 360° sound- (possible) reliant on the quality of your wifi networklet me explain the +/- of 360° sound. firstly it is excellent because it is relatively impervious to location in a room. you can place it in a corner or in the center of a room and you have a consistent listening experience. the speakers are expertly tuned to provide a great listening experience for 99% of people without them having to be an audio enthusiast. but this is also it is source of contention. people compare it to directional bluetooth speakers, but this comparison cannot be made. directional speakers have a much easier time of producing sound because they only broadcast in, you guessed it, a single direction. but directional speakers also have their quirks, such as only sounding good when they are pointed directly at you, let is have any negative reviewer turn their comparator bluetooth speaker around and compare them that way!all in all, echo provides what i would determine as a 6/10 listening experience. 10 being $4k iems, 1 being children is toys. the $1000 stereo in the background is 8/10. most bluetooth speakers i have heard are 3-5/10.',\n",

       " '<u+00a0>thanks for watching and reading my review of the amazon echo (2nd generation).  in fact, it is actually a review of just a few of the many possibilities of home automation.  i got started with home automation back in october, 2017 when i purchased a nest smart thermostat.  i followed up by purchasing an amazon echo and harmony hub for my home theater/av equipment.  from there i started purchasing some of the \"smart outlets\" to use with my regular lights, and for the holiday season, my christmas lights.as shown in the video, i am now able to control all my christmas lighting with one command, as well as control the temperature in the house and what i want to watch or listen to on the tv or stereo.  i know i have only scratched the surface of all the capabilities that are afforded by the echo.  once you purchase an echo i encourage you to keep an eye on the amazon \"skills\" because that is where you will find even more useful capabilities.  it takes a bit of tweaking on what you \"name\" your \"activities\" or \"devices\" but once you get that setup, alexa does a very good job of completing your request on the first try.as noted in the video, i have the following setup:amazon echo (2nd generation) and echo dot (2nd generation)nest thermostat (3rd generation)logitech harmony hub (controls tv, apple tv, receiver, etc)tp-link bluetooth receiver (connected to my yamaha receiver audio input)othway smart outletdekinmax smart outleti hope you found the video and review helpful.',\n",

       " 'overall, the echo is an excellent product to add to your home. when i heard about the echo back in 2014, i was very skeptical someone could come up with something useful for it to do unless you were entrenched in the smart home world. fast forward three years, and i currently own two echo dots and a regular echo. as long as you like music and even occasionally search the internet or set a timer, you will enjoy the echo.things i like:first off, when i was reading reviews trying to decide if i was going to purchase an echo or get a dot and a speaker, i read a lot of reviews that slammed the new echo for poor sound quality. i personally have not noticed any issues. it has a good amount of bass, and music sounds good at almost any volume level. is it a $500 home stereo system? no, but it is more than competent. for most music listeners. while you can buy a dot and a speaker, i would not recommend it simply because the echo is a much more streamlined and attractive way to listen to music.i own an iphone, and as pretty much everyone knows, siri is not exactly the smartest assistant out there. i can not compare it to the google assistant, but i can say that alexa is more than competent. there are only a couple of times where she has not had an answer for what i am looking for, but overall, she pretty much has a good answer. it is kind of silly, but one of my favorite things are her jokes. they are always a punny kind of funny, and it is one of those ways that amazon made sure alexa seems like a natural part of your home. the only thing amazon should add to the echo is the ability to search using bing. i say bing because google uses its own search engine for its home speakers, so amazon will have to turn somewhere else for searches. right now, the functionality is missing (as far as i know,) so adding at least some ability to search would put the echo that much further ahead of the google home.if you get an echo, you will more than likely get some form of smart home device. when i bought my 3rd echo, i got an offer to buy a tp-link mini plug for $10. i took the plunge and now use it to control the lamp next to my bed. overall, echo integration works well and makes lighting even more convenient. my favorite thing is the routines, where you can tell alexa a catchphrase and she will do several things at once. for example, i have it set so that when i wake up, i say \"alexa, good morning,\" and she will turn on the lights and begin my flash briefing. it is really a slick process that you do not realize how much you will use it until you have it in your home.things that need work:by far, the biggest con for echo users is the alexa app, at least on ios. setting up my echo, it could not connect to my home wifi network and failed three times. i had to use my phone as a hotspot and then come back in about an hour to connect it to my wifi network. when i am trying to pause music on the alexa app, it usually will not actually pause the music. it is not necessarily huge things that ruin the alexa app, but it is the sum of the little glitches that make it frustrating at least.the multi-room music works most of the time, but if one of the echos gets turned off, it messes the entire thing up.the way amazon has set up the households is annoying as well, mainly with relation to smart home. if you add a smart home device to one account, it will not automatically sync with the other accounts attached to your echo, meaning you have to manually add each skill, smart device, and routine to each account. i get why skills and music does not transfer between the two, but really amazon? if we are in the same house, we are going to use the same smart home devices. please fix!the smart home section of the app could use some beefing up. mainly, i want the ability to tell a group of lights to turn off at sunrise, on at sunset through the alexa app. can i do it through the individual apps of each device? yes, but it would be a lot more convenient to be able to take care of it all through the alexa app.overall, i really do enjoy my echo. the positives more than outweigh the negatives. if you have been wondering whether or not you are going to buy one for a while, take the plunge, especially with the $20 off deal going on right now. you will not regret it.',\n",

       " 'let me start by saying i initially went with a set of two google home units and four chromecast audio pucks to outfit my home for audio distribution  and home automation. i was very disappointed with the sound quality of the two home speakers. the chromecast audio units worked fine. the big problem: the software used/needed to drive the system while casting or listening to music would continuously crash.enter the amazon echo and alexa. i saw that amazon was offering the echo for $99, and if you buy three, they would take $50 off the total. if you signed up for the amazon.com store card they would give you an instant $40 gift card credit, along with 5% cash back on each purchase. well that meant i could buy three and only pay for two. i really only needed two, but what the heck. they are now selling for $79. if you are on the fence, stop reading this and buy one, or three (ha ha) before the price goes back up. come back when you have done that.unpacking was easy, not a lot of junk in the box. an echo, and a power adapter. some paperwork. that is it.i plugged her in, and alexa soon began giving me instructions on how to get up and running. turned on the alexa app on my iphone 6 and followed the instructions for getting her communicating through my home is wifi. initially the software seemed to have trouble recognizing my very long password (note: never use anything less than a 26 hexadecimal password.) after a restart she hooked up on the first try.my wife, son, and i began asking some of the suggested questions, and so far so good. we have had fun with the jokes, and i enjoy how the system integrates with our calendar app. most importantly though, was how alexa sounded. compared to the google home...wow!! i have two very high end systems in my home. my ears are very sensitive to differences in quality between speaker types and tonality. whereas the google home, with its single speaker element sounded flat and muffled, the echo is two element system sounds very bright and airy, with as much bass as you could expect from such a small package, and the highs are clear, not muddy at all. the echo gets louder too, with much more headroom at the higher volume levels. the echo is a very balanced little gem. i have no problem listening to the echo for a short period if i just want some ambient music in the background. it is not going to match the sonos, but then again it also costs much less.we have one upstairs, one on the main floor in the kitchen, and one in the basement. it is nice to be able to use them as intercom units. we can \"drop in\" on our son and his friends in the basement if we need to talk to them, or my wife can talk to me without having to yell from the kitchen or upstairs if i am busy downstairs or in the basement.alexa does have limitations and i can only hope the techies are working on them. my biggest gripe is that alexa does not recognize the phrase \\'top pop clean\\' when i want to listen to that particular station. or any other \\'clean\\' stations for that matter. you see, i am absolutely disgusted with the lyrics in many of todays new music tracks. i am not sure what changed to allow music to be published or broadcast with all the f-bombs you hear nowadays (with the exception of \"who are you\") but as long as there are people ignorant enough to buy that sort of trash, there will be a market for it. my point here is the programmers need to make the minor change to recognize when the word \\'clean\\' follows a known amazon music station alexa should check the database for a [blank blank (clean)] option and either play it or come back with \"there is no option for a clean version of [blank blank] station. should i play it anyway?\"using alexa to play pandora stations does not seem to have the above limitation.overall am very happy with the purchase. i really should only give it a four star rating due to the f-bombs we heard during testing of amazon music radio stations. otherwise it is definitely a five star product! i may get an echo dot or two for complete whole home coverage of audio.**update**  this morning, dec. 6, i asked once again, \"alexa, play my top pop clean station\". lo and behold! she recognized it! she responded, \"playing your top pop clean station.\" awesome. i will experiment with the other clean prime stations to see if it was just a fluke later on.',\n",

       " 'i’ve had my  echo 2 for about a week now and pretty much concluded that i’m going to return it, it is minor advantage of better sound is not enough for me to recommend it.there are several reasons for this.  first, i already own an echo dot and i find it better serves me than the echo 2.  the echo 2 does have better sound but for me this is unemportant since i mostly use the dot for podcasts and news where sound quality is not a factor, if i am going to listen to music i just turn on a spare sound bar in my living room and the dot connects and i have better sound quality than the echo 2, the two devices otherwise share exactly the same functionally.in the final score, all things considered, the echo dot is the superior device, at half the price. here is why:1. the dot is half the price2. about 1/4 the size3. performs exactly the same as the echo 24. uses micro usb cable & extensions for power5. can use any usb charger => 500 ma output6. can run off any usb 2000 mh+ battery that charges phones and tablets ($15 - $25.00)7. plugged into a battery it can run all day on battery alone, no hunting for a socket8. the dot is portable, the echo 2  ->  slaved to its proprietary power supply, is not.let me be honest.  from the second i saw that ugly wall wart and proprietary cable connector i hated the echo 2, i knew immediately, before turning it on that i was going to hate it because wall sockets are at a premium in my house.  worse, the sockets are almost always fully occupied, buried behind furniture and such.  early this year i changed most of the outlets in my house to ones that have usb sockets as well so i did not need to have extensions, socket adapters and so on, a ten foot after market usb extension cable can be had here for $5.00 at the local “five below” store.none of this works for the echo 2.  with its clunky wall wart and a proprietary connector it is slaved to only the included power cord.  can not use it outside, can not use it anywhere without an outlet.had i been aware of this failing of the echo 2 i would not have ordered it, the far smaller, cheaper and much more flexible echo dot is simply a better choice. if i want to use it somewhere that has no wall socket i just plug it into one of my 8000 mh batteries, works for hours.',\n",
       " 'i got this device two months ago, thinking it might double as a bluetooth speaker now and then as well as provide access to the hyped alexa skills.thus far, i am not using it all that much, although i appreciate being able to tell alexa to add items to my shopping list or give me the weather.but despite not using it all that much, the speakers are now problematic, garbling or distorting sound from time to time. i reboot and the problem goes away temporarily, and then the problem reappears.since the device is completely dependent on its speakers, it is obviously unacceptable to have the speakers go bad. and after only 2 months of light usage?i personally would just return the product and wait for a future version, but it is too late to return. (you have a month.) so i went looking for warranty service and the amazon setup to access this service is a convoluted set of pages with a lot of legalese and umpteen zillion links. why should it be hard to get support for a product that amazon is promoting to the max? i am currently waiting on amazon is response to my inquiries and may increase or decrease my rating depending on that response.one other warning: alexa at times starts speaking in the middle of the night. i do not know whether the device is reacting to a sound or informing me of an update, but i about crawled out of my skin the first time i heard that eerie voice in the night. now i try to remember to tell alexa to go to sleep at night.if you think you will actually use the alexa skills, you still might want this product. however, i strongly recommend that you use it mercilessly during the first 30 days so that there is time to easily return it if you get a dud.update (a day later): my entry of a 2-star review plus an email to amazon customer service resulted in a reasonable and fairly rapid response from amazon. you have to jump through some hoops because -- like all technical customer support services these days -- their procedures must assume that the customer is an absolute idiot to begin with. (\"yes, it is plugged in.\") i am now cautiously optimistic that amazon will improve the support pages to provide better instructions and response for those needing warranty support. i still think they should just use normal procedures to return/replace the echo for longer than 30 days, but they might get there.update:i have successfully contacted alexa customer support and a replacement is underway. amazon could improve support by including links to alexa customer support on their warranty information pages, and i hope they will do that at some point.for now, if you think you have a defective device within the warranty period, be sure to investigate and try any troubleshooting/fix tips that apply. always attempt a factory reset if only because amazon will ask if you did that before taking any action.

       " 'the amazon echo is wildly popular as a smart speaker. the price is great and it bolsters the similar echo dot four-button control interface (volume up/down, mute, command). the voice controls seem to work well and alexa is surprisingly good at taking commands, even when the music is playing.if you’ve thought about adding a smart speaker to your home, this is a great purchase. if you’re already an echo owner and you’re considering adding more, the second-gen echo is at a great price to do so. it is also a great gift idea for anyone. the joy of “ask me anything” at your beck and call!while amazon has made it intuitive to use and set up, you will need to go through some steps to personalize your alexa. similar to setting up siri on a much larger scale, this is easy to do with the alexa app. the 2.5-inch subwoofer and 0.6-inch tweeter, provides great sound in any location of your house. to my knowledge, you can use music streaming services like spotify and pandora to play music. we’re already amazon music subscribers, so it is simple to use voice-commands to play tunes from our playlists or recommended stations. you also have bluetooth connectivity and an auxiliary outlet for hard-wired connections.one of my favorite features, is to ask alexa to tell you jokes or to play games, like jeopardy. we also, as a family, enjoy having alexa tell our kids to do things by simply saying, “alexa, simon says, tell isabella to eat her vegetables or no dessert.” then, alexa promptly repeats your command to your daughter to eat all of her vegetables. lol!if you found my review to be useful, please let me know by clicking the “yes” or “helpful” button. thank you.',\n",
       " 'first, an fyi: the sound issues have been addressed as of firmware update 592452420.with this firmware update, the bass response is now much improved, and turning up the volume will not make your ears bleed with screeching, tinny highs. almost literally a night and day improvement! really; it appears that my echo received the update overnight.in my original review, i had compared this echo to our echo dot + vaux speaker and a friend is 1st generation echo. while i have not repeated a side-by-side test with the 1st gen, i again compared it the echo dot + vaux speaker setup and (perhaps unfairly) another echo dot paired with a bose soundlink mini ii. the echo now sounds better than the vaux speaker and, surprisingly, can decently hold its own against the bose speaker! to my ears, the mids and highs of the echo are now about as clear as the soundlink is. it is only outperformed by the bose on the low end, but that is to be expected when pitted against a speaker that is close to $200. still - like i mentioned earlier - the bass response on the echo is now greatly improved and helps to create an overall richer, fuller sound. it is now a respectable smart speaker fit for music enjoyment.also noteworthy is that its listening capabilities appear to be improved. this echo can hear you from surprising distances, even if you are not projecting toward it or are speaking from the next room. it is also good at hearing you over pretty loud music. (unless, of course, it is blaring; then you will have to scream at it or speak very close to the microphones.)i was so close to returning this echo after being disappointed with audio performance that did not sound \"improved\" at all. i have to say i am impressed with amazon is prompt action to resolve an issue on a product that has not even been out for an entire week!',\n",

       " 'if you are concerned about sound please read the following:tldr: amazon sent out a firmware update that significantly improved sound ( the reviews that say the sound sucks are from before this update)i had initially bought the sonos one (alexa built-in) and even though the sound was amazing it was not responding to \"alexa\" well. i saw that target had a cyber monday deal on all echo devices. so i said that i will buy it and if the sound is as bad as the reviews made it out to be i would return it. during setup input the echo beside the sonos speaker and was testing the wake word sensitivity (obviously the echo won in this respect). then i tested music on both. i was really disappointed with the echo as i have the first generation echo and the 2nd gen was significantly worse. at this point i decided that i would have to return and see if sonos upgrades their wake word sensitivity. then the echo does an update. just to try it one more time i play music again initially on the echo. as music starts playing on the echo i was amazed (i went back to the spotify app to switch the speaker to the echo as i had thought i was playing it on the sonos). i went back between the echo and sonos a few more times and regarding the sound, it was really close! if the song that you are playing does not have bass, the speakers are almost indistinguishable! if it does have bass obviously the sonos is better. if you are just a casual music listener there is really no reason to go with the sonos as the echo is amazing despite what the review say, as they were probably posted before the firmware updates.',\n",
       " 'this is a terrific product and a very good value. the sound is excellent. of course it can not keep up with high end speakers, but it was never meant to do that. i have a couple of these as well as four echo dots. i use them all the time to add items to various lists (groceries, etc.) that then show up on my phone when i am, out shopping. great feature. i ask it all kinds of questions and she is very responsive. i play a news podcast every morning. i can ask her what is on my calendar and she will tell me. i also use her to turn lights on and off. but i mostly use her for music. i use amazon music for this as it does not work with itunes. alexa will occasionally fail to understand what you are saying to her, which can be frustrating, but voice recognition has not been perfected. however, this rarely happens and, as a baby boomer, the level of technology is, in my opinion, quite remarkable.one problem arises from the multi-room music feature. first, you can put each echo in only one grouping. sometimes i want the music playing throughout the house while other times i just want it to play downstairs. the app will not allow me to put the same device in two different groups. second, and this is the most frustrating, the music will often just stop playing when it is playing in more than one room. i spoke with amazon about this and they said they are aware of the problem and are working on an update for this.one other minor issue. she wakes up when you say her name (you have a few choices here). sometimes she will hear her name and wake up when you are just having a normal conversation or when watching the tv. she will even do this when a word is spoken that is close to her name. she is very sensitive and she will respond when you speak in a normal voice.',\n",

       " 'even though i am the ultimate tech geek and tend to buy whatever the latest in consumer electronics, i have been skeptical about the amazon echo ever since it was released. why buy one of these when you have your well-established siri, cortana, and google assistant -- which have been around for years. moreover, why should i complicate my life with yet another set of unique communication protocols?well, when i was offered a substantial discount through audible, i decided to give echo a try.with the first couple hours of interacting with alexa, i had my epiphany. alexa trumps the other interactive technologies in big audacious ways:1) the fact that it is always on and listening makes a huge difference. no buttons need to be pressed. yes, you might say that you can do that with siri. but there is a huge difference. where it trumps \"hey siri\" is its listening technology when enables to me to say \"alexa\" from across the room, when music is playing, in the same way i would call out the name of someone in my family. believe me...this makes a huge difference in the user experience.moreover, siri is impatient and often misinterprets what you are saying. alexa is right on the money i would say around 90% of the time.2) the skills that come standard are pretty much in line with what the other voice assistants have. and...while there are a lot useless 3rd party skills, if you do your homework, you will find some solid gems by browsing for \"best skills lists have been compiled by various websites.\"3) if you love music, you are in for a treat. the speaker is awesome, given the size of this cylinder. initially, i paired it with a humongous bluetooth speaker i own. however, now i mostly use the echo is built-in speaker. the sound is easily within the realm of \"dedicated mid-sized bluetooth speakers\" that amazon sells that you would pay $150 bucks. i love edm, jazz, and metal, but the true measure of how great the speaker is that i also enjoy listening to classical on it as well.moreover, the kicker is that you just say, \"alexa play some bach choral music,\" and she plays it using the music service of your choice. you do not have to open your phone and dig through playlists. the music just plays.if you are wondering if this device is for you, i would say you are coming in at a good time. the echo is in his 2nd generation. initial bugs are squashed, and the sound is great.this is is one of the greatest things i have purchased in 2017.',\n",

       " 'i bought this to complement the half dozen echo dots i bought to achieve multi-room audio. i have a number of logitech squeezeboxes, but when logitech dropped spotify (huge mistake) that created a problem. my solution was to buy the dots to get multi-room spotify, then plug them into the back of the squeezeboxes via a short 3.5 to 3.5 cable. this was a very good and cheap solution for me. the only problem was that i wound up with two things to plug in, and in the dining room (where i could not hide the cables) it looked messy. so, i opted to try the echo. i read reviews saying that the sound quality was not up to much, so i had pretty low expectations, but i was very pleasantly surprised at how good the echo sounds. not quite as rich as the dots plugged into the squeezeboxes, but good enough. plus, echo has tone controls, which the squeezebox never managed.the multi-room audio works great, by the way. there are some limitations on designating a device to be in more than one group (a \"premium\" feature, i understand), but that has not caused a practical issue. i really think the echo and echo dot are both terrific products and excellent value for money. bluetooth implementation is solid. i only wish that there was some way of having my collection of speakers connect to my enormous itunes library, but i think that is a political rather than a technical problem and may never be solved. fortunately, that is where my squeezeboxes come into their own, though it means having to fire up my logitech media server, which is sometimes inconvenient.the only thing i do not like is that amazon dropped the prices right after i bought the echo and the echo dots!!! any chance of a credit, amazon?',\n",

       " 'this is my second echo. the first is in my bedroom and this one is in the kitchen. these echos are handy, more so as i figure out what works for me.i use them to answer questions, though many of the answers are from wikipedia and not up to date. still that is okay. the weather reports are better. i can get today, tonight and tomorrow, though it is taken alexa quite a while to default to where i live and not where she thinks i live. and the timer and alarm features are great. these have proved to be a wonderful asset.so i have to tell you that my echos get me through my medication, exercise and stretching routines with the timer feature. here is how i use the echo: i have to stretch out my calves, for example. i know that the length of time to get to my count is 20 seconds on each calf. so i set the timer over and over for 20 seconds and do not have to count--an activity that drives me nuts. sometimes i have to do 10 sets of something or other for 5 counts for each. i set the timer for the longer period of time so all i have to do is repeatedly count to 5. i take medicine for pain. instead of getting all restless waiting for medication to work i set the timer for 25 minutes. by then i should be out of pain. by letting alexa track the time i am less anxious and then she reminds me that i am out of pain. that is a feature that is really helpful. btw my physical therapist likes my use of alexa to count out my stretch time. he has recommended to others who also lose count or do not like all the counting.finally in the kitchen i do not like all the timers on my stove and on the counter so i threw out the counter ones and use the stove ones discriminately. alexa tracks at least three timer needs simultaneously and even names them. all good to great for me. now i can track when to add something to the oven, when to check my pot of soup on the stove, and even when to make something in time for dinner.and, yes, i do ask for a song to be played occasionally. but that is a mixed bag like the wikipedia answers. i can ask for a song and alexa tells me she can not find or does not know it. do not like that. on the other hand, bruno mars is always there waiting.finally the look of the echos is hardly worth discussing and asking to change the volume on this 2nd generation echo is a toss up as to what will happen. but like my first kindle fire i will probably come to love this thing once i have figured out how it works best for me. that of course is the big question.',\n",

       " 'little or no fm radio reception here. yes i have a collection of bluetooth speakers but the music selection and the multiple steps to connect and control audio via phone/tablet/pc are a pita.for years, i was concerned about evesdropping and ignored the echo phenomena. that said, in a moment of weakness i ordered a dot and my world changed. i use it in my study with and without paired bluetooth speakers and i do not have to lift a finger to switch between the output or play anything from siruisxm to radio stations to digital music collections and more. the very next day i ordered an echo 2.the living area is another situation. sure i can pair my phone/tablet to the high-end sony soundbar to rock the house but yet again, it required multiple steps to do so and control it. since the so is mortified by any kind of unapproved music forced upon her, i decided to emply an echo 2 so that i can quickly start, stop and control radio and unlimited music selections with as little drama as possible from the breakfast table.i can now blabber to alexa in any tone of voice in order to get the job done. plus, both the dot and echo 2 have hearing that is far better than mine. she responds without error from across a large living area even when music is playing. damn the reviews but the sound quality is plenty good enough and you can easily connect it to other speakers if you want to host a house or pool party. dot aside, i really do not understand all the griping about sound quality. i was delighted that the echo 2 has enough fidelity and volume to satisfy me and annoy the so. the echo product family is supremely engineered and one of the best products that i have ever purchased--and there have been too many to count.disclosure: after dot, i uploaded my entire digital music collection to amazon music. while it is comparably under-featured when compared to other mobile players, it works very well with the echo products and i can listen to my collection sans zero drama and effort.update: after nearly a week of listening, it is true that the lower mid-range of some types of music and individual tracks are muddled and alexa is voice and voice output in general is a tad loud with too much bass. however, i am confident that an update will eventually smooth everything out. that said, i wish equalization was available in the alexa app in order to tailor the sound for the environment and the type of music. i also found that speaker placement is critical. at first i had it 8\" from the wallls in a corner which caused the bass to boom. i moved it in front of a flat wall and it sounded better. i think that the further away from walls the better in order to accomodate the 360-degree sound. i think that ultimately it would sound the best in a middle of a room but who has power outlets located there (a kitchen island comes to mind)? finally, i would like auto sound levelling because when my daily briefing switches from staid and bassy npr to noisy reuters tv, the volume jumps condsiderably. nevertheless, i still love this well-designed piece of kit but note that i use it like a radio at mostly lower volumes. thanks amaon for bringing back a hands-free radio+ experience for somebody that gets minimal radio reception.',\n",

       " \"what is the coolest about alexa (echo) is her prime feature is access to all internet information, plus what we share with her and everything in our devices. so she quickly became a family member that is always focused on our needs and ready to fill them. whenever we know need something, alexa adds it to our shopping list, including giving us amazon buying options and placing orders we approve. alexa keeps our calendar, reminding us to call, pick someone up, get ready for a scheduled call coming in, or wakes us up by calling out name or playing the song we requested at the volume we asked. when we ask, she gives us our shopping list by text or orally. she makes phone calls and texts, pulls up programs we want to watch and whatever music through her formidable room-filling speakers.she is even a good therapist. tells us jokes when we need a little fun. quotes any famous person we can think of. plays any music we have asked so far. gives us meal suggestions and even their recipes!her capacity, alexa is 'engine' is not in our unit. so, as amazon expands her hardware and software- her ability to improve our lives- we do not pay for upgrades. they just surface. alexa is like a child growing up and always able to do more. with coming self-driving cars, she will likely even be able to bring a vehicle to our steps, take the kids to school, us to work or out for evening.she just keeps getting more valuable.\",\n",

       " 'i have been using the amazon echo and echo dot since christmas and i should note that my wife purchased them from bed bath and beyond so i would not see what i was getting.  i should also say that i do not have any devices connected to it such as a thermostat, outlets, or garage door opener,  so i do understand that i am not getting the full benefit of all the echo is capabilities.  with that being said, after using the devices, i do not care to add any alexa compatible devices because i have found that the product has a few major defects.1. the biggest problem which will probably cause me to return the echo, is that only one device can stream amazon music at a time unless you pay an additional subscription fee.  this is quite frustrating because i purchase all my albums and songs from amazon music.  if my wife is listening to amazon music elsewhere, i cannot listen to music i already paid for.  why would i buy an album at market price and then have to pay a fee to listen to it?2. it is buggy.  3 days in a row now, i was asking alexa to play different songs, and periodically, the sound was not working.  with my ear right next to the echo i could barely hear the song playing even with the volume turned all the way up.  yesterday, i actually had to unplug the device and replug it back in to get sound.3. the voice recognition is sub-par at best.  on three separate occasions i was 5 feet from the echo requesting something and the echo dot which is 30 feet away in a different room responded.  i speak very clearly and articulate my words, however,  when adding things to my to-do or shopping list (which are excellent features), alexa interprets what i said horribly wrong.4. both the echo and echo dot have just started talking on their own about four or five times each.  for one thing, that is very creepy, but it is also really annoying too.5. the timer on the echo, which i use frequently because it is in my kitchen does not turn off 10% of the time when i say \"alexa stop.\" i have to unplug the device to get the timer to turn off. (note: it has been a week since i had to do this which is the longest it has gone so maybe an update fixed the issue)all in all the concept is awesome and i truly wanted these to work excellent.  unfortunately, they are nowhere near as advanced as i thought they would be and there is no \"google like search engine.\"  alexa can only answer useless questions like,  \"how far away is the sun?\" and \"who was the president in 1985?\".  good luck asking what poisson is ratio for concrete is.  the echo is also still very app dependent and you cannot ask her to remove any items from lists or if a specific item is on a list.  i cannot ask, \"is there coffee creamer on my shopping list?\" as she will respond with the total number of items and start listing them in order.  i do not want to hear 25 items just to know if coffee creamer has been put on the list.',\n",

       " 'we are having so much fun with alexa. she is almost like a real person. she arranges music whether old or new, classic or rock, answers questions, and even tells jokes. during a christmas celebration, our grandson was eating meatballs. someone said be careful and not sneeze or the meatball might roll off the table like in the old song i remember as a child. we wondered what happened to the meatball in the song. alexa found the \"on top of spaghetti\" song and played it to the delight of everyone.we have not hooked up the adapter to be able to shut off lights, call people, or do other things yet. the echo is easy to use and the sound system is wonderful and clear.alexa is now in 4 different family households since christmas. everyone loves alexa and the echo.',\n",
       " 'after using the echo for about a month, i can say it is at best \"entertaining\" at trying to make it understand what you want.  it is search for trivia is lacking.  if you expect results like you would get with a google search, you will be very disappointed.a lot of times my wife and i are watching tv and we ask alexa about an actor or actress, and many times we come up short and resort to google on our tablet.adding skills can add to the functionality, but many of the skills are more for marketing purposes rather than providing useful functionality to you.  there is a \"dewalt tools\" skill that will let you ask:  \"alexa, ask dewalt tools what is your history\"...  i would like to meet any person who would find this skill useful... just so i could ask \"why?  why would you enable such a useless skill?\"i can see alexa being much more useful if you have smart devices in your home, such as a connected thermostat, roomba, garage door opener, etc.  as asking alexa to change the thermostat setting, or asking if the garage door is open, would be very useful.using alexa to add events to my google calendar is also not quite ready for prime-time.  you would think this would be relatively easy, however, how alexa and google handle timezones creates a problem.  (alexa does not send timezone information with the request, so google assumes the time is gmt when storing the event, however, since google has my timezone set as pst - it converts the gmt time to pst when displaying it.)  personally - imo google has this correct, and alexa should send my timezone with the request to create the event.  after all, she knows my timezone.on the brighter side - alexa does have an opinion - albeit clinical - to the question \"alexa - does size really matter?\"',\n",

(we tried.) maybe a future tap software update will allow it to group with echo products in the home, which would be nice since tap owners would have another speaker in the group. i have attached a photo of the amazon tap (on left) alongside the echo.',\n",

       " 'i almost got one of these last december, but i kept asking myself what am i really going to do with it, and could not come up with a compelling reason. i decided to hold off then, but here we are a year later and the idea of home automation is quite a bit more appealing to me now than it was a year ago. i decided to get my feet wet with an echo and some philips hue bulbs. setup was pretty straightforward, the echo was up and running and controlling the philips hue bulbs in about 10 minutes.i was immediately impressed with the echo is sound quality when playing music. it actually has some decent bass for being such a tiny thing. i had originally intended on placing it in the kitchen, which is more or less centrally located in the house; however, when i tried playing some music the sound quality was good enough that i figured it would be a potential replacement for my bedside alarm clock radio. i now have it in the bedroom and it does a really great job of filling the room with sound, with surprising bass given the small form factor. i was secondly impressed by the echo is mic pickup; just as a test i tried giving a command from near the kitchen with the bedroom door closed (but not shut) and it picked up my command (i was not yelling, either).the integration with the philips hue bulbs is what i initially got the echo for, and it rocks for that. it is handy being able to tell the echo to turn on or off certain lights from elsewhere in the house; for example, no more walks down a dark hallway to the bathroom in the middle of the night - i can ask alexa to turn on the bathroom lights as i am getting out of bed, and the hallway is sufficiently illuminated for me (without turning on bedroom lights that might disturb others). also nice if you are laying in bed falling asleep and just do not want to get up to flick the light switch off - just ask alexa \"turn off the bedroom lights\". you also get dimming control, which is great. and, you can control them while away from the home - never walk into a dark home again.my initial impression with the echo and the philips hue bulbs was positive enough that i went out and got another four pack of bulbs and a dot for the kitchen. i may eventually put another echo in the kitchen (for the superior sound quality listening to music over the dot), and then relocate the dot to the living room or another bedroom, or wherever ends up making most sense. i am now looking at the full gamut of iot home automation devices such as thermostats, cams, and locks. i feel like the echo is the perfect gateway into that world.',\n",

       " 'love this gadget!  setup was fairly easy.  the echo can be connected through your wi-fi or can be connected to your phone.  if you do connect the echo through your phone, notifications coming through your phone will interrupt music that is playing through the echo.  if you want uninterrupted music, etc., leave the echo connected only through your wi-fi.  it works best if you have amazon prime with music unlimited.  if you do have this service, you can ask alexa to play a particular song, artist, genre of music, ask her your local weather, etc.  if you have devices that connect to alexa such as smart plugs for lamps, etc., you can program alexa to turn lights on and off with your voice.  you can operate these smart devices once they are linked to alexa using your voice.i also stream video using an amazon fire stick on my tv and it uses alexa to find movies, applications, etc.  this makes your voice a powerful tool.  when connected to your phone, she can send messages, order stuff for you on amazon (how convenient), give you a recipe, etc.  the list goes on and on...i also found that alexa quickly understood my questions.  using an alexa app on your smartphone, you can give amazon feedback as to whether she understood what you were asking for.  this helped greatly with voice recognition.  she certainly does better than the voice recognition device i have in my car.they are adding new applications for this device all of the time and you will get emails from amazon echo notifying you of her new capabilities.',\n",

       " 'general:- we purchased the echo ($99) because we wanted the better speaker.  the music does sound nice.  we expect that general voice interaction would also be better.- i was told that alexa uses the yahoo search engine and not google.  makes sense since google has a similar product.  the search ability seems fine.setup:- as is usual with technology, the setup is a pain.- alexa assumes that you have smartphone and use the app.  we have a samsung s5 android with current system patches.- i found the app to be unstable to log into.  sometimes it would only accept part of the password and then just restart.  i did eventually get logged into the app and alexa pulled the phone list.  if you can ever get logged, in the app sort of works.  this app response happened on both of our s5s so i do not think it is the phone - but you never know with phones.- i did spend 45 minutes on phone support, she had never seen this issue of self restarting.  we eventually gave up setting up alexa from the phone and used the web site (alexa.amazon.com) and your amazon logon.  that worked ok.  once in, the basic setup via online is simple to link your wifi (you need your wifi password).  laptop web works easier since it is easier to put in a complex password via laptop than on the phone.  so i would use that for basic setup.- but if you want voice calling by name you need the app on the phone.  alexa must automatically pull down your contacts/phone list.- i think alexa pulls your contact list every time you login to app, so you need to re-login if your contacts change.  i did not find any documentation on this.- alexa does not pull down your preferred phone number for a contact.  alexa always uses the mobile number even though you have selected a preferred number in the phone.  i have not found a way around this.  i am still trying renaming the mobile number in the phone but no success.- you can voice call by saying the phone number.- i cannot identify any procedure that allows you to reliably log on to the app.  one time i got app to work by: uninstalling; power off phone; power on phone; re-install app; then i was able to login.using alexa:- alexa basic is free with a basic amazon account.  the basic account gives you the ability to ask questions and only a small amount of music.  amazon prime gives you more music.  full amazon music is $3.99 per month if you have prime.  with a basic account amazon music is $9.99 per month.',\n",

(app developers constantly add new skills to make alexa smarter and allows her to do more things.6) getting the latest news. (i do not always have time so getting a brief rundown of what has been happening around the country from my favorite news networks is great)these 6 things are what made this product worth having. alexa is going to get smarter over time and there is so much room for growth. i am looking forward to the incredible innovations companies like google, apple, and amazon will bring to the market. it definitely is an amazing product to have and i am glad to have bought it!',\n",

       " 'i bought a 1st gen shortly after it came out. i have use it daily since it arrived. the sound quality was always enough that i could hear the music but could not really pick up a while lot of detail and the low end frequency was really missing. also, it did not blend in with the living room decor, so it seemed to stick out a bit.the 2nd gen. has made big improvements to both. the echo delivers cleaner, fuller sound while at the same time bringing enough low end to get really good all-around sound from a single speaker. the shorter wider profile along with the fabric cover make it fit in about anywhere in the living room. microphone sensitivity and range is about the same as the original. the only negative thing i could say about it is i wish it still had the ring for volume adjustment. it made it easier to turn down after one of the kids had been listening to their music at near full volume or adjusting to just the right level for listening to music when company is over. not that you can not do it by voice command, or the buttons on top of the new version, just a personal preference.overall, i love it. between cooking instructions, drink ideas, reminders, timers, linked calendars, smart lights (a must have,) alarms, news (even local), weather, not to mention my spotify (and more i do not feel like typing out), i am certainly getting my money is worth.',\n",

       " 'edit: i am returning the unit.i had a good experience with amazon technical support and i think that some of my connection issues might be an issue with my unit.i had my wife bring home her tap that she uses in her office. if you put the 1st gen echo, tap, and 2nd gen echo in a line and do a sound test - in my opinion, the 2nd gen echo sounds about the same and possibly worse than the tap. it does not sound remotely as good as the 1st gen. i do not expect bose or sonos quality - but to my untrained ear this one sounds significantly worse than the 1st gen. it is flat and distorted at high volume.do not know how amazon is selling this as an updated \"upgrade\" from gen 1. and shame on dolby for attaching its name to it.--------------------------------------i have 3 of the original echos. good enough sound and never had any real problems with them. definitely a useful and enjoyable part of our home.i suppose they might fix some of the stuff through firmware or updates of some kind - but this echo is a miss. as others have pointed out, the sound quality is poor. i am not an audiophile but i would classify it as flat. like the sound i would get out of my cell phone speaker in a good environment.i also find there to be a slight lag in alexa responses. this is similar to the echo dot but i never experienced that with the last generation echo.finally, i have also had connection problems. it can not possibly be positioning because it currently resides in the same location as a previous generation model. at random intervals, the internet connection will drop and at times it will lose connection with the network altogether. i then have to unplug and replug it back in.super disappointing. i like the look but i think the product has gone in the wrong direction.',\n",
