0,14,"amazing product. the accuracy recognizing what i say is extremely good. been using it mostly for news and music in the morning, and to impress friends when they come. want to set up some iot lights that i can use voice control on but they are too expensive at the moment. if you have a chrome cast you will never have to search for videos again because you can just find them with your voice and it integrates flawlessly. the speaker is surprisingly very robust. 

only negative for me is having to say ""hey google"" every time. it is not as smooth as saying a name like alexa."
1,14,"i have had my google home for about 3 weeks and have been very happy with it.  setup was a breeze and could have been done by anybody.

// pros / difference from echo:
- #1 major difference. google home can handle different grammatical structures and syntax for the same question.  simple example: what is the capital of norway? = which city is the capital of norway? = what is the norwegian capital?  i find this really good for family and friends because -- unlike with alexa / echo -- we do not have to learn how to exactly verbalize every ¡°skill¡±.  google home allows us to speak naturally without us having to learn its own language.
- the above ability combined with google home is awareness of context helps it with some complicated questions like: me: ok google. what is that song from the lion king?  > google home: the songs are circle of life and ¡¦ > me: ok google. play it please > google home: sure. playing circle of life. = wow. note that i did not even mention the song.
- #2 major difference is multi-room audio!!  i have got two google home devices and two chromecast audio devices ($35 each) in my home, and i labeled the group as ¡°entire home¡±.  so i can say: ok google.  play arianna grande in entire home.  echo is unable to do this (yet?).
- the ¡°good morning¡± / ¡°my day¡± feature is really neat on google home. it tells me in one pass about the weather, traffic to work, my appointments, and rounds up with news from my favorite sources.
- works flawlessly with chromecast devices.  example: ok google. play a funny cat video from youtube on the living room chromecast > then google plays it on chromecast, which triggers my living room tv to show the video
- there are some customizable bases that are better suited to your home decor.  however, these are a little pricey for fabric and metal.  nonetheless, google home is very soft and unassuming in its design whereas  echo feels very industrial to me personally.

// pros / similarities with amazon echo: 
- the far-field mics work well and can pick up voices from across the room without having to yell.
- the speaker quality is very good.
- works well with google play music, spotify, youtube, etc.  but google home does not work with amazon music (yet?).
- connected home - works well with philips hue lightbulbs and nest thermostat.  i have not tested out other brands like lifx, wemo, etc.  i do think echo has more connected home applications because it is been in the market longer, but i do not use those other services at this time.
- set reminders, timers, get recipes, get directions, call an uber
- there are lots of ifttt (third party app -- try it out!) routines that can be built.
- the google home app is very easy to use.

// minor cons
- you do have to say ¡°ok google¡± to prompt the device.  however, this is no different than saying ¡°alexa¡± for echo.  the pro i seen in this is related to privacy -- i do not want the device to respond to anything my family is talking about unless we specifically want to interact with it.
- only the top of the google home device has a light indicator to show when it is listening.  so if you have got this on your kitchen counter and you are seated on your couch (at a lower height), you may not see the lights.  echo overcomes this with the light ring around the device.
- the google home device can not be used as a speakerphone or be used to make phone calls. 
- saying ok google also triggers my phone.  i would like the ability to choose the device with which i want to interact.

// major cons:
- there can only be one user profile! so i can get a run down of my day, but my girlfriend can not get hers; we can only hear my services but not hers.  to be fair, this is not that different from echo, but it is a little annoying.  this seems like the next step for both google and amazon.

overall, i think google home is an excellent product, and i look forward to seeing more services being made available."
2,14,"the google home is a well built voice activated speaker that sounds pretty good and is useful for many things, specifically the google home is quite useful for setting alarms and timers, and i have been getting up in the morning more consistently than i had been before i received my google home.
the google home is able to play at volume levels that are plenty sufficient for most situations. 
if you choose to buy a google home, after connecting it to your internet connection, then it is best to download the google home app for android or apple, then locate and optimize all the settings to get the best experience using the google home. in the settings there is a setting called accessibility, it allows you to turn on the option to play an audible sound, which indicates when you should speak your verbal request. this means that after you say ok google, you will then hear an audible beep, so you will know exactly when to speak your request, without this accessibility sound option turned on, it is necessary to be looking at the google home device when saying ok google, so that you can see the lights on the top of the google home light up, of which the lights indicates that you should then speak your request. it is basically easier to say ok google and hear an audible beep indicating when to speak your request, than it is to say ok google and have to be looking at the device to see the visual indicator to know when to speak your request.
the google home app has the option to add your home address, which is necessary for the google assistant to provide your weather requests, as the google home needs to know the location of the weather that you are desiring.
the google home app allows you to set a desired music playback source, and also allows you to create a list of your desired news sources, allowing you to customize the news that you can hear playing through the google home.
newer versions of the android operating system have the built in options of allowing the google assistant to be always listening, so that you can say ok google, and then you can make a verbal request, the same way that the google home does, but using the google home device is a much better experience. the two microphones on the google home pick up your voice noticeably better than the microphone on a smart phone.
the google chrome web browser has apps and extensions that can be installed, which add interactivity with your google home device. do a google search for chrome web store, and it will bring up the website where you can search for and install the available google apps and extensions.
the google keep app for google chrome, allows you to create a shopping list that can be used with the google home assistant, just create a shopping list in the google keep app, then ask the google home assistant: what is my shopping list, then the assistant will verbally remind you of all the things on your shopping list.
the google keep app can be downloaded for android or apple and can be installed on your smart phone, allowing you to create shopping lists the same way.
the google calendar extension for google chrome, allows you to quickly add calendar entries, then you can ask the google home assistant: what is on my calendar, and the assistant will verbally remind you of your calendar events.
the google cast extension for google chrome, allows you to see which song pandora is playing, this extension allows you to pause music playback and also adjust the volume level, all of this from the google chrome browser.
below is a list of verbal requests that the google home can be used for:
what time is it
set an alarm for 7 am, set a timer for 30 minutes (multiple timers and alarms can be set)
stop alarm, stop timer, stop all timers, stop all alarms
what is today is weather (your local weather will be read if your address has been set)
what is the weather in ventura, california (any city and state can be requested)
what is the humidity (your local humidity will be read if your address has been set)
is wal-mart open, is best buy open, is jack in the box open, etc..
what is on my calendar (calendar events must be added first in google calendar)
add orange juice to my shopping list, add bananas to my shopping list, etc..
what is my shopping list
play music, pause music (music will play from your chosen default music source)
play google play music (use this if pandora is default music source)
play pandora music (use this if google play music is default music source)
play news, pause news (news will play from your chosen list of news sources)
turn up the volume, turn down the volume
volume level 4, volume level 6, volume level 3, etc.. (volume levels 1 - 10)
what is the volume
the google home voice activated smart speaker, allows adding philips hue lighting control, it is necessary to synchronize the google home device with the philips hue bridge, this synchronizing is done in the settings of the google home app on an android or apple device, once this is setup, all of the following can be said to control philips hue lighting. 
turn lights on 10 percent, turn lights on 50 percent, turn lights light blue (daylight), turn lights white (warm white), turn lights red (great for movie lighting, or night lights), dim lights, turn lights on 100 percent, turn lights off.
the google home has a really nice power supply, which has a silicone strap that wraps around the cord. a quality power supply always adds to making an electronic device have a luxury feel to it.
my overall opinion of the google home assistant, is that owning and using the google home has made life more convenient."
3,14,i ordered this because i had seen it advertised and thought it would be fun and could be helpful too!  i have a lot to learn yet but i have used it for music and playing games! you can ask it anything of course! this is the future and it is already here in my house! i think everyone should have a google home.!
4,14,"it is pretty much like having the power of the internet, without having to type. you just ask..."
5,14,"i think that amazon is echo (alexa) need a bit of competition; however, alexa is leaving the rest of them behind. until google ""catch up"" with as many apps as amazon & partners are offering i am afraid ""google home"" is going to be left behind.
amazon is echo (alexa) debued a few years ago...and already is in a class by itself.
alexa can control residential lights, thermostats, lock & unlock doors to the residence, set burgular alarm, turn on the (water) irrigation sprinklers, turn your vehicle on (get it all warmed up for you during cold harsh weather...defrost the windows), she will let you know if you are low on fuel, oil and break fluid! she can even order pizza or a uber ride for you! lol 
she can place orders on amazon for you (especially repeat orders such as computer essentilas-like printer ink. she can also make a ""to do"" list for you, a grocery list, a events calendar, etc. alexa can help children with homework, she reads books  and play numereous mind games & music. she has a great, vast resource that she utilizes. she grows every day; therefore, she is always up on current events & data!!!
she gives the forecast for the day ""or"" an entire week. she is quite accurate with the weather (have not made a mistake with me yet)! ;-d she can give you transportation schedules for ""local"" buses, bart, etc. alexa can book entertainment venues for you (such as stubhub, etc.), reserve the tickets, etc. let you know what is going on in entertainment industry or whats showing at the theater/cinema. she also knows what is happening in your territory-specials events, galas, plays, shows, tours, festivals, art exhibits, musicals, ballet, etc. she also keep you ""updated"" with sports, current & past events. she is current with political & world news. she has an app that allows her to recite requested recipes, etc. (this app is growing daily). she is also an alarm, and has a ""reminder"" timer! you will never be late for events, picking up the kiddies from soccer practice and you will never burn that cake again! :-d
yeah, alexa is wowesome. 

google has a lot to catch up to! ;-d

 if they get the software engineers and people that just love making apps, then ""google home"" will give amazon alexa (echo) a challenge. i am sure both products utilize far-field voice recognition (this allow the units to accept voice commands from across the room). the speakers on echo are so superior. i can hardly believe the ""sound"" that comes from this 9-inch product.

amazon has also released their ""portable"" version of echo, it is call ""echo tap""...you tap the button on the front and she can do everything that the ""home stationed"" echo (alexa) can do. amazon is ""echo tap"" is great for people on the go! it is shorter and is protected with a sling (rubber) casing (cost extra, a lot of assorted colors to chose from, there is also a ""travel"" pouch available). amazon is echo tap utilizes (both) wi-fi & bluetooth...it charges on a small disc (very cool looking). it last about 12 hrs. on a single charge. you can also ""charge"" with your usb port on laptaps, etc.
additionally, amazon has another fine product call, ""echo dot""! 
dot is smaller and can be hooked up to ""any"" sound/stereo system(tv ???)...and it will actually allow the system to receive voice commands. pretty cool. it is 1/3 the size of amazon is echo, (which by the way is the perfect height & size...9-inches x 3-inches diameter, weigh about 37 oz., cost $179.99, but you can get it for $149. amazon promotion period). amazon prime members purchase was only $99.00 (but, i think that ended a couple of years ago). amazon was offering ""echo"" for the special debut retail price to get the ""buzz"" going for their product at the time.
i am not sure if google home promoted their product in such a manner. but, i must say that the $129.00 price point is not to bad, ""if"" google home offers a zillion apps to make it work like amazon is echo (alexa). hum....

amazon is echo, amazon is tap & amazon is dot is here to stay, i.e. until we get our robots & jet packs! ;-d then they will become ancient...a thing of the past! lol
*p.s. my family & i enjoy google brand products, as well; therefore, we are looking forward to seeing what they do with  ""google home"" in the future (2017-2018).
this is going to be a lot of fun...let the race begin...so far amazon is echo (alexa) is in the lead!"
6,14,"google home has a long way to catch up to alexa. i have been using alexa for a year now and also echo dot. i use android on my phone so i thought i would give google home a try and if it worked out ok i would get rid of alexa. big mistake.
i am glad for walmart is return policy since i was very displeased with the google product. i imagine in the future they will catch up to alexa but no where near what alexa can do now.
another thing, the alexa voice is so much more soothing to hear and listen to. i like the fact that i can send messages to my wife is phone or have alexa call her without searching for my phone. alexa tells me when i have a shipment coming from amazon. i know google home is linked to walmart.
even when i set an alarm or timer, google has a horrible ringing sound where as alexa has a nice pleasant chime.
 i asked google to do several things and it usually says sorry, i cannot do that yet. i will stick with my alexa for now and wait a couple of years for google to try and catch up. until then, i took the google home and minis  back to the store."
7,14,"we love our google home and regularly use it at the dinner table, by placing piano music (with our toddler in mind).  it is been fun to watch our 16 month-old son learn about google and he can even now say ""google"".  we play music, turn on and off lights, and occasionally ask about weather and news.  the price at $99 is a steal and a lot less than we paid for.  i, personally, do not trust amazon, and would shy away from using alexa, since amazon will heavily market to you, based on everything you do, and probably even the conversations you have in the background.  i feel much safer with google home than i do with amazon.  at any rate, this is a really wonderful device and i hope that google will partner with more companies as time goes by so that we will have more options to choose from.  the sound quality is great, by the way."
8,14,"i do not know what i did without my google home. this is great when cooking and you need to know how to convert measurements, just ask google! google will help you with many tasks like that throughout the day. she will even tell you jokes and more. you can almost have a conversation with her. google has also helped my granddaughter to speak more clearly. when i first got google home, she did not speak real clear, but she wanted google to listen to her so she has come a long way with her speech. google now listens and understands what she says (normally she is asking google to play songs from the frozen soundtrack). i am buying her a google mini for christmas this year and am sure she will be so excited to have her own google. we play a lot of music on google and it really sounds great. i have had google home for almost a year now and i still love it."
9,14,"i have had google home for 1 year now. i liked it so much, i bought 2 more for my house, and gave them to my kids for christmas this year.  you must have wi-fi and download the google home app on your phone or ipad.  then all you do is plug it in and follow the directions and within 2 minutes it is hooked up. you can decide between a male or female voice. i use her so much, that when i am not at home, i am talking to her out loud and look crazy---lol.  my favorite is to add things to the shopping list and it is always on your phone, listening to music, listening to sounds of nature at night to go to sleep to, she has an alarm, the kids play trivia games with her, i add things to my calendar and she will tell you what you have going on today. if i am cooking and forget something in a recipe or how hot the oven should be, she will find the recipe for me. my kids ask her to tell them a story and she reads books to them. she gives directions, weather, shops for you, turns netflix on, wakes me up in the morning. to be honest, she feels like one of the family.  since my work is all on gmail and google calendar, presentations, etc. this was the best option for us. the speaker is fantastic. i have both the mini and the large one. they are identical except larger one has better speaker.  
just buy it.  it will be the most used item in your house."
10,14,"so far my google home (gh) experience has been a little of a let-down.  only one google account can be set up for now which means that shared calendar information is not handled by gh.  i share a calendar with my wife and hers is the primary calendar used for family planning.  gh does not list any events created on her calendar, only my primary calendar.  i also wish i could force it to recognize a certain route to my work.  it often provides travel times for alternate routes which are not good options for me. gh also only allows one shopping list so you cannot currently set up a shopping list for several different stores.  i do like how it integrates with chromecast audio.  you can set up speaker groups which is nice.  as for the gh itself, speaker quality is decent.  it lacks highs but handles bass sufficiently for the size of the unit.  for now it is just a novelty.  without added updates, its value to me will be limited."
11,14,"i never seen google deliver a product that was not great until now. i have google for everything (including cell phone service on project fi). i had high expectations for this device. the speaker quality and volume is only half of the echo. both have a shopping list (this is the only thing google slightly does better). the playing of music is where google me their biggest corporate mistake ever! and specifically playing random music (e.g. ""hey google play...""). the echo will do this for free on most songs or of you have amazon prime, almost any song. google will not play any random songs (yes it back has pandora), unless you pay for youtube red. yes youtube is free on any device (including an apple iphone), but on the google home, you have to pay!!! maybe google will change this on the future but for now amazon is the big winner when it comes to these little in home devices."
12,14,"i really like the google home. if you have thought about buying one, i would recommend it. (i have never tried the alexa, but i have heard gh is better. the price is definitely better.)

there were a few hiccups, however. first, i had to buy a new wifi router because my old one was too old or inefficient; i am not sure what the problem was, but i could not get the gh to connect to it. i bought a new belkin (for about $60) and now everything works fine.

second, the gh right now is more of a novelty than anything else. it answers questions (briefly) and plays music. it can do other things, but at the moment that is all i do with it. 

however i really like the technology, and i am sure that in the future all appliances (tvs, computers, microwaves, etc.) will be able to tie into the gh. this will enable you to say, ""hey google, preheat the oven to 350."" at the moment such tech does not exist--or i do not have it--but i am sure it will become more common (just like wifi is now almost universal). i know that it can do some things like that, but i do not have the tech set up to enable it to do so."
13,14,"fine example of ai (artificial intelligence).  works well.   simple plug & play installation.  download and setup app to make personal preferences, location, etc.  device has incredible sound and the ability to ""understand"" you.  the female voice is clear and pleasant.  it is in the learning stages so not everything you ask it yields a successful response.  you get its attention by saying ""ok google"", ""hey google"" works too.    works with chromecast devices to turn on/off lights, tv viewing, etc..  read the product description online to get a good understanding of this device and its capabilities.  i would like to able to customize ""ok google"" to another wakeup phrase, along with the thousands of other home users.  home has the ability to translate into many languages but not as many as google translate on my android phone (?).  i like the instant weather and news updates just by asking ""how is my day?"".  it is a bit of a gadget and this point but i have faith that google will make this the best on the market by bettering it is completion (echo, siri, alexa)."
14,14,"the google home sits beside my amazon echo.  i have enjoyed the echo but i wanted the vast wealth of information that google has that is missing on the echo.  i can not notice a difference in audio quality but my husband says the echo sounds better. the home gives me more music options than the echo since my google play music, pandora and spotify accounts are not the premium levels. one thing i miss on the home is that the echo can be set to sound an audible tone when it hears the wake word. i miss that handy feature on the home. the home handles math calculations more naturally than the echo because it recognizes monetary terms.

alexa, what is 20% off of ten dollars? ""20% of ten dollars is two dollars.""

hey, google, what is 20% off of ten dollars? ""the answer is eight us dollars.""

obviously google knows how i shop better than alexa."
15,14,"i am far more impressed than expected. having both amazon echo and now google home, i would recommend google home especially if you are a google user. the speaker sounds amazing! i can hear music playing throughout the entire house. google homes capabilities are endless- plays games with you and tells jokes (kids love this!), gives me traffic updates before i leave for work in the morning, keeps track of my shopping / christmas list, operates my tv, lights and thermostat, great for homework or just random questions. i find this to be very educational for kids."
16,14,"though the google home is great for answering questions, it is ability to do much else (without paying hefty additional fees) is quite limited.  for example, you must pay an extra $30 for each light you want controlled and an extra $70 for connecting it to your tv. even then, the functions are very basic.  the biggest drawback is that you cannot request google home to play a song from your music library (even using google music) unless you purchase a premium google music account.  what?!  all in all, i highly recommend that you wait to purchase google home until these features become standard."
17,14,"i purchased this product during the $99 promotion and it is just amazing. shipping was also fast. so seamless and intuitive, setup was a breeze. very happy with being able to use a speaking voice (and it responds to both ""hey google"" and ""ok google"") and it hears/understands both me and my wife so no ""voice setup"" required like it is on your phone. great design, very nice sound quality. there are a few features not developed yet that i really want it to do like being able to send an email or text/call, or being to understand more languages besides english- but this is definitely the future. i can see myself using this product for a long time, and starting to use more ""smart"" products so i can take advantage of the full ""smart home"" setup.

love this!!"
18,14,"it is easy to set up.   connect it to your wireless network and download the software to your smartphone.  easy to navigate.  she is not married and does not have any children - yes - we asked these questions.  sadly, when asked if we could change her name she said it was too much work for google to do this :-( and yes, she did answer this question.   keeping the google calendar linked between my phone & my desktop and now easily availabe on google home is great.  it does not let you add an appointment and i hope this becomes available.  another reason for the 4 stars is the limited music choices compared to alexa.  i would like to see iheart radio and even sirrus radio would be nice to have too.  the kids use for homework and i am always using it while cooking for setting timers, alarms to wake up the kids.  love it!  definitely smarter than alexa."
19,14,"the decision was simple for me, google assistant, google is light years ahead of the competition, do not believe me, ask any of the competition follow-up questions.  if you like repeating the same question with additional content (follow-up) then the gh is not for you.  but if you like to have a normal conversation, gh is the way to go.  google assistant builds on your question with answers that are more normal to human interaction.

now if you are an amazon person, a prime member, one who orders a lot with amazon,  it is understandable to use amazon is voice assistant, easy to order and track orders.  amazon is in the business to sell you stuff, google is an information/search company.

you will hear/read that gh (google home) is limited to a small list of devices, not true, do not believe me, go to ifttt.com for the huge list of supported devices.  ex. wemo switch is not directly supported, at this time, through gh app, but they work great through ifttt service, actually better since you have more options/triggers with ifttt.

i am extremely pleased with gh, bought 2 of them, one for our daughter who is more a google person than i.  she will love it for christmas...can not wait to show her the ifttt world..."
20,14,"i get google music which includes commercial free youtube.  i love this device.  you have to say ""hey google"" every time you want a new command and say it a little distance from the top.  you can ask it questions and it will answer.  i say ""hey google, play google music vince guilardi jazz album and there it goes.  you have to get the google home app to start it up and connect it to your wifi.  feel free to call to set it up, the guy i talked to spoke great english and was very patient with me as i am not a youngster so i am not familiar with electronics.  highly recommend you do not have to worry about the music staying up on your computer.  you have to have a smart phone or tablet to use.  a laptop is not enough to set this up."
21,14,the microphone is useless when the speaker volume is high. requires that you shout at the top of your voice.
22,14,"i wish i could give it lower that one star. the device, although seems interesting lacks some key features, i.e. reliability and usability. let me explain.

first things first, it is not very easy to create your own playlists and/or play music. takes a long time and effort to set it up and then it is not very easy to do unless you buy the google play service. i think that is not very helpful.

but the bigger issue is reliability. the first unit died within two weeks. it simply will not hear anything. i tested with online support (spent a couple of hours through reset and all) and the only option they would give me is to send my unit to them (i pay for shipping and then in 5-10 business days they will send a replacement. well lucky for me, the device was still under 30 days so easy return.

then i bought the two pack from costco. configured the device and two days later it bit the dust as well. this time the device shows the 4 white dots, nothing else. no response, cannot reset nothing. worked with support, this time i had the worst support rep, completely ignoring all messages and symptoms i sent and kept asking me the same questions over and over again. for example, after i sent the initial message (only white colored dots...), the rep asked me what color dots and are they changing color? or how long has it been happening or does it happen with only me or anyone else also? remember, the device is not working, not responding at all.

anyways, i am very disappointed with the device quality and customer support. will not buy this device again."
23,14,"i took a chance buying this device, because i do not own a smart phone, but have a tablet with android. that was enough, to get it working, and now it is my main source for music. it will play any song by any artist, that is within u tubes library.  plus while your chilling on the music, you can get it to answer, almost any question you have.  to me, it is the best, of both worlds.  really love this device, you have to get one.  sorry, about screaming, only to make a point."
24,0,arrived on time. and works as expected
25,0,i bought this product and i am so happy and excited about it. i went home and tried it out and entertained myself for hours. my kids love asking it questions and learn from it. i use this to operate house lights (you have to purchase this separate). i am buying another one to do whole house speaker and have more than one for the bedroom and one for the living area. it is super easy to setup and user friendly. i am by far not a person who understands technology very well and i was able to get this going. this is great and my wife loves it. the speaker is really good for how small it is. i guarantee you will enjoy this product!
26,14,"i chose the google home over amazon is echo due to having an extensive personal library of music in google play.  unpacking and using google home at first was great.  ask it play any song from any artist, and it would play exactly as asked.  the more i used google home for music though, the more limited i found it to be.  i realized it does not connect to my google play library, and seemingly what was a trial, does not play the specific songs any longer.  it now selects ""similar playlists"" that it finds, and plays something related.  sure, i can use it as a bluetooth speaker, but this is not what i thought i was paying for and hugely disappointed to find out this music feature is now a pay service.  so now if i want google home to play a specific song by an artist, i have to pay for the premium services.  whether its spotify, google play, pandora, or youtube red, guess what, you have to pay.  for many years, i have been using google for many of their apps, services and devices, but unfortunately, this one is not for me.  huge let down, and happily returned it today as i do not need a novelty bluetooth speaker that tells me jokes or talk about the weather."
27,0,a welcome addition to our smart home.so much more than a speaker.
28,14,still getting used to google home but enjoying it so far. we are slowly adding lightbulbs and outlets to make life easier. i love being able to get my shopping list by saying what i need throughout the week. i am confident google will add much more to make life a little easier. the speaker sounds great for it is size and looks good too. we also bought the mini for our bedroom. makes turning off lights feel like magic as we drift of to sleep listening to ocean waves to cover the sound of noisy neighbors. very happy we decided to go with google.
29,14,"i was on the fence between this and the amazon echo. i fell and bumped my head and purchased this. glad i  did. this thing is awesome with it is conversational mastermind!!
love listening to the news, weather and getting traffic updates early in the mornings. nice addition to my office!"
30,14,"it does what i need it to do. i keep the little one on the screen porch for stock quotes, weather, and alarms. they big one i use inside for a number of things. i did have to get a young girl with little fingers and a smartphone to download the app for me and get it on my wifi. those kids are amazing on those things. will be getting some accessories for it soon."
31,0,i got this for my daughter. she lost her eyesight about 2 years ago and she really enjoys it
32,0,was so easy to set up and use. i had this item up and integrated with all my lights and plugs in no time. best of all like some other systems it does not come with a yearly fee
33,14,"since it has access to youtube for music and google assistant for internet searches, it is more powerful than alexa.  also google is ahead of everyone in artificial intelligence which it will incorporate into the google home and google mini boxes."
34,14,"google home has become a daily part of my life. i look forward to using it every day, particularly when i start my mornings with asking it ""tell me about my day"". the fact that it is so easy to integrate it with all my smart home devices and cast to it from my android phone with ease is wonderful. the fact that i can ask it questions, and it has contextual awareness of previous questions i have asked is awesome. music playback and being able to use it to play videos off of voice command on to my chromecast is great!

ok, now to the things i find missing: it does not integrate as well with casting general audio from an ios device. this means that you can only cast to it through apps that support casting. this is also the case with the chromecast, but honestly, considering that it is a speaker, i would at least have liked to have the bare bluetooth connectivity functionality that i expect out of other speakers in my home (or even the amazon echo). also there are many commands that it says it ""can not do yet"", like adding stuff to my calendar, setting reminders, making calls, sending texts etc.. also the device is really only tied to one familiy member is google account, so any accounts and preferences you might have will be specific to you and not to other people that are in your home. they will not be able to play their own curated spotify playlists or youtube playlists. that is not to say that if you mention an artist you want to listen to, it will not auto-generate a playlist for you. 

at the end of the day, despite the lack of bluetooth capabilities and single-account service, i have faith that google will open up apis for community development and even for their own service integration so that calendar, reminders, etc. actually work through it. i happened to get it at around $100, so the price point was also a big reason for me to get it over the echo. also, the echo, while a bigger speaker with more mics and slightly more capabilities for the minute, is just not as smart of a device. i feel that inevitably this is google is element and they are poised to do better than the echo."
35,0,"amazing device, and even more amazing sound. for such a small unit i am surprised how much bass it produces, and how well it fills a family room with high ceilings and a kitchen totaling around 600 sq.ft."
36,14,"i do enjoy this product as it reminds me of the amazon alexa which i have been wanting and when got this, i just did not enjoy it as much as i had thought i would. i just returned it because i have to almost scream for this thing to hear/understand me. :("
37,14,"the greatest thing impacting my rating is the amazon echo does more than google home. one example, is the echo handles google calendars better than home. another is i have echo linked to several wemo devices in our home and it performs flawlessly. home can not handle the wemo devices yet. many of homes shortcomings can be overcome using ifttt programing, but it would be nice if more functionality worked right out of the box. it also does not have the same capabilities as google now on our smart phones as far as doing internet searches. i think it will be a great device once more functionality is built in."
38,0,"well its in very good quality, very nicely done, thanks"
39,0,so intuitive and helpful.
40,0,outstanding product!  to bad i did not have one during high school :)
41,14,we are having a good time with google home.  the sound is fabulous and we are enjoying listening to music of our choice.
42,0,great!
43,14,i was very disappointed with this product. i had to take it back to the store because i could not use it on the computer. i needed a smart phone or tablet. i bought a second generation amazon echo and bought a lenovo tablet and it works great. i can get its features on the computer.
44,14,"this is a great device!  i have owned an amazon echo for some time now, but this is definitely a better device, in my opinion.  couple it with a few chromecast  audio and stream audio all over your house.  i use it mainly for calendar, news, and music."
45,14,"i was bit hesitant as i have used echo before. but google home is more accurate in getting queries. and most surprising part was that its speaker is pretty good. not like super premium bose but for 129$, its really nice.

and it looks cool!!"
46,14,"the speakers and microphone are very good. its able to understand most things you tell it.

one thing is that google needs to add more service integrations to be able to make it more useful."
47,14,every thing is excellent
48,14,"so easy to set-up and use, well worth your investment. it is a very useful gadget that is also attractive.  i purchased several for christmas gifts being they were on sale. we have been using ours a lot lately in the kitchen playing christmas music from pandora, great sounding speaker!  it is also useful in the kitchen to set cooking timers, providing measurements, cooking instructions and setting up your grocery list, as well as checking your calendar events while having your morning coffee.   i am hoping eventually google will update the software to allow the user to make/receive calls or send a text. i also want them to permit the user to have options in changing it is wake-up command, i do not really care for ""okay google"".  i understand all this and more will be forthcoming?"
49,0,excellent
50,14,"had to repeat ""ok google""  loudly on numerous occasions to get the  unit to respond.  lengthy  responses from the  unit were difficult to understand at times because of words being run together and speedily spoken responses.  the sound quality for music was excellent.  the response of the echo is superior due to the number of mics in the unit.  what troubled me most was having to repeat ""ok google"" at least twice 1 out of every 5 times before it would respond.  i returned the unit.  hopefully this problem will be corrected in the future."
51,14,"i got to test both echo dot 2nd gen and google home together. i have a honeywell smart thermostat, philips hue lighting and a lifx bulb.

so google home lost out in the end! it needs a lot of work with it is integration. even though the current price of $99 is appealing and it does have much better sound recognition, it is integration with smart things is abysmal. 
it is on the right track though and if it does not receive the google axe soon, it will bypass echo in it is next generation.

problems with home:
there is not much direct native support for many brands to start wth. so you are reliant on ifttt to do most of the stuff. that is where the problems start. 

in the end, it was not able to do the primary job of toggling all lights upstairs on or off using one voice command..... and that did it!

pros:
speaker is good. pleasent friendly human voice. not robotic like echo.
looks way more aesthetic than an echo.
voice recognition is miles better than echo.
human voice interaction is very good and again, daylights better than echo.
love it that i can insert numbers and text in ifttt triggers. like i can say set the temperature to #. or, set the bulb color to $. something not available with echo.
it does not say ""sending it to ifttt"" for every ifttt trigger like echo and i can customize what it says. more human again.

cons:
cannot create groups of lights for hue. mainly a problem with hue itself but echo mitigates it by providing groups. so basically, you can ask home to turn on the light in bedroom but are unable to turn on all lights upstairs with one voice command. 
cannot toggle hue lights in ifttt trigger. works 1/10 times. adds to the problem above because you cannot even use ifttt to mitigate that by creating multiple triggers on same event. the trigger worked fine with lifx though.
it was not able to see my bought music on google play and play it. kept saying my playlist is empty. gave up soon on this and just played from my phone.
have a properietery power input. for someone who likes to hide wires behind furniture, it hinders my mobility of things. should have been some standard usb input."
52,0,"so far we love it, now i can listen to music whenever i want and the sound is great!!"
53,14,"i initially had some connection issues with the speaker to my phone but for the most part, the setup was pretty easy to do with the google home app.  

one of my initial negatives with this speaker is that it has no battery power and must be plugged into an outlet at all times.  granted i can understand that battery drainage may be greater with this speaker because it is always on, but at this price, a battery, in addition to the power cord, should be included.   

the design is pretty simple but there are different color bases that can be purchased to give a slight different look.  i am fine with the basic look and not sure the different colors are worth the extra cost.

it is a pretty smart speaker, but some seemingly simple questions, it does not always know or gives incorrect answers.   even different ways of asking the same question, sometimes confuses the speaker. it also does not always activate when you say ¡°hey google¡± either, resulting in a repeated attempt to get its attention.  hopefully, that will improve over time as the technology improves.  it does do some things well though, such as playing songs and giving some basic information, such as the weather forecast.  i like the fact that it works with a variety of devices, such as thermostats and the like.  some simple tasks are still not quite there though.    

sound is decent for a speaker of its size, but of course, will not blow you away.  
  
although i do think these smart speakers are a bit overpriced and have its limitations, it is a pretty cool device.  hopefully, its ability will grow over time.    

4 stars"
54,14,"awesome little gadget, love it for my google music -¡°play hamilton!¡±.  future functionality will turn this from gadget to necessary technology."
55,0,"amazing!  how did i live with out ai my whole life.  not only is it fun, it is super useful too!"
56,14,"quick answers to basic questions. no longer need to pick up a phone, tablet or go to a computer to search. music options have expanded."
57,14,"does not seem to have as many features as amazon is alexa - but off to a good start. enjoy being able to link spotify account, and seems better at answering questions."
58,14,really cool
59,14,i like the base of the speaker and fast response to commands
60,14,"is it better than the amazon echo? no not at all. will it be better? yes. do not buy this device if you want it all right now. save your money and by a echo dot. however when  phone integration comes on line. this is going to be the hardest thing in the world to find. 

phone integration would allow google home to send, and read texts or tweets or update your facebook. will allow you to say ""ok google call my wife*,  google will know who your wife is, make the call then use itsself like a speaker. 

amazon echo will never be able to do that."
61,14,"1) apparently you must use a phone or a tablet to set it up. could not find a way to use a desktop pc
2) music service not ready for prime time. if i ask it to play a well known artist. it first plays a little known song by that artist then then next 5 songs are a similar genre but by other artist or impersonators. asked it to play some light music and it gave several songs with strong drums, clearly a millennial driven play list i guess. 

clearly another example of a "" me too wanna be"" product being rushed to market before it was ready. wait a year or more to buy this one or get one of the competitors products that have been around awhile if you just have to have a desktop speaker that tells the weather"
62,14,"not as useful as this is made out to be... i mean i can see this becoming something very handy in the future. right now it just does not quite do what i hoped it would do. i still feel very ""techy"" when my friends are over. but this is no personal home assistant."
63,14,i have purchased two of these thus year and my mother lives hers.  the speaker is great and really gives nice full sound.  great way to stay organized play music and listen to jokes all of the same time.  it is good to have in the kitchen for recipes.
64,14,"i own the alexas, which i like very much, but the home is also really quite good and i would recommend it also.  it does not have the same information as the alexas, but what it has is quite good and worth the cost.  it is fabulous!mr"
65,14,i hate that this product constantly stops when playing music from pandora and you have to pay to use youtube music.
66,14,"i had a hard time choosing between the amazon echo and this.   the echo has been out longer and is currently ahead of the game with compatible devices.   however,  as a long time android user,  i like the seamless google integration and feel the compatible device list will catch up quickly.   in the meantime,  it is easy to utilize most by creating an ifttt applet.   the google home device was easy to  set up,  and i had it connected to my hue bridge in minutes,  and and applets created for my lifx lights minutes later, as well as a couple of other commands.   also,  just plain fun to ask questions of as well as useful!"
67,0,we were at a friends who had the amazon alexa.  the kids had fun playing with it so we decided to get the google because it ft our budget better and we were not going to use it for ordering things.  alexa seems to understand questions better and have a better wit hen asked crazy things
68,0,"love it, great addition to our home"
69,14,"this is extremely disappointing, it can only play music through google play, pandora, youtube red and spotify,  none of which i use. so i thought i would play it on bluetooth which i soon found out it dosent have. you cant use it without wifi. and almost every question you ask it, the answer is sorry i dont know the answer to that yet."
70,14,"google puts a lot of effort in upgrading it and adding new functionality. that really is promising.
i have been reading about smart assistants for a long time before i decided to buy one. in some sennce it did disappoint me, it actuelle quite regularly missed the 'hey google' hot word. that really is annoying as i did not aspect that after reading all the reviews that said it almost always works.
still, i love it. love speaking to a computer and have it do things for me. love listening to music and podcasts or getting the weather, all without even touching any device. would recommend it, but know, it is not perfect. not even close."
71,14,"i probably had too high of expectations going in to this purchase but i was told the search engine and learning algorithms for google are much better than the amazon tools.  (amazon units cost less)  i do not have an ""internet enabled house"" so i can not turn on lights or talk to my thermostat or even check the door locks.  it is kind of fun asking it what sound an eagle makes or what is the population of christmas island, but aside from linking it to my pandora account to play music, it is just a very pricey toy.  
 - it is worth noting that you must download the google home app in order to program the google home and it must be connected to a wifi signal all the time.  the programming is not complicated and mostly intuitive, but that might be because all i had to do was to look up my pandora login information again.  if i had to do this for every light, appliance or device, i might feel differently."
72,14,"device is great but beware of the google express promo offer. had to contact google 3 times, was made to jump through all kinds of hoops to redeem the offer. in the end was given a rebate that took 7-10 days."
73,14,"unfortunately, google home will randomly stop playing music!  i have re-booted several times, tried different locations, and even purchased spotify premium....all to no avail.  for no reason at all, google just stops playing a song...sometimes coming back on and sometimes not.

there are literally hundreds of customers complaining about this online!!  and customers who own both alexa and google are saying that they have no music-streaming problems with alexa.  how in the world did this product clear ""testing""??

if google does not repair this humongous glitch within a week, i will return the product to walmart and purchase echo."
74,14,"sorry but that was on of the reson considering buying, maybe some day?"
75,14,"great price. can help with so many things. so much easier than looking stuff up on the computer. need the # to home depot and their hours real quick? done. plays games with you, great selection of music, i can not say enough i did my research online to compare it to echo, and that is how i made my decision. it does not know everything yet, but hey, it is a computer and everyday it is updated. it is my new best friend! it actually makes you feel like you have someone there with you. i do not even refer to google home as it, i refer to it as her!"
76,0,"we have a lot of fun with this, asking  it questions! love we can listen to favorite music and have it set up to make calls. if my husband falls he can yell ""hey google call ....."" and it does! love it!"
77,14,"cool gadget - i really love waking up and asking google to play me the news (and i get to choose which news source). great to link to spotify and ask to play playlists, or your favorite artists/tracks.

there are definitely some teething issues - google can not do everything yet but i am super excited to see how quickly their machine learning algorithm gets better and better and more features are added to the capability. the good news here is all you will need is a software upgrade, not a new model - the speaker is also nice and puts out solid sound quality."
78,14,"i have had gh about a week i like it, the microphones are very responsive from just about anywhere in the house as long as there is not too much background noise. very handy in getting quick info and playing back ground music. sound is very good as long as not played at full volume. right now due to the lack of apps i view it as a nice 100 dollar radio with bonuses.  it is way behind the amazon echo in apps the reason for four stars but google has promised they are working on that.  when that happens it will be very useful to have in the house.  oh yeah if you have a chromecast stick it can cast to that as well.  if interested in such tech i would highly recommend it."
79,0,everything. so easy to use
80,0,i love it. it very helpful.
81,14,was going to get the alexa echo dot by amazon however my main use was going to be for playing music and the bass is amazon im so glad i watched a youtube comparison video on the 2! its worth the money for sure
82,14,"as i write this rwview and have just box this to take it back.  it is little more than a novelty music playback device and nothing more.  i was impressed with the music/speaker sound quality, but i was looking for and exspecting a lot more.  i wanted to be able to check movie times, make callender appointments, phone calls, and a slew of other basic administrative thing an assistant could do, but the functionality just is not there yet as google home constantly tells me.  it was cool to say a song and it would play, but that is it.  hopefully echo dot qill be more of what i wanted."
83,14,works so much better than alexa and can make phone calls
84,0,i use it mostly for answering questions. it is very fast and informative.
85,14,google home product is good
86,0,hello 1234
87,14,"google home is a well made a functional item.  however, according to google support the unit does not provide any method of locking the open (unsecure) wi-fi connection that is established.  i.e., any wi-fi device can connect to the unit.  in all fairness the vast majority of people cannot do anything with this connection.  however, call me overly cautious, a hacker may be able to gain access to the unit and potentially the home network.  

this resulted in the item being returned.  amazon echo is approach is to hide the units wi-fi once it has been set up."
88,0,what did i like about it? what did i not like! the speaker is just awesome! like having a surround sound system with a subwoofer all in one compact device.
89,0,hard to get everything setup. little instructions inside but good sound.
90,14,"easy to marry to my smartphone.   the gal living in google home ""is still learning"" on some subjects.  need to be precise when asking her a question.  we are still figuring out just how to do that.  she is very alert and it is like having another member of the family....a bit on the frightening side, but that is the way of the world today.  she does say ""goodnight"" in a special, and personal way, also.   so always say goodnight to her."
91,14,"this product is not bluetooth or aux compatible.  there are no wireless options at all.  there is not an easy way to play music from your phone.  you need to create a google music account and transfer your files.  product is not usable via public wifi.

the speaker is decent"
92,0,"i can not live without it, i use it for spelling, math, and definitions it so easy, you will love it"
93,0,"got this for my husband for christmas. gave my son an echo dot, so we were able to compare them side-by-side. 
both are great for providing music for a room, which is what we use the google for 90%. they are both great for getting general info, such as the weather. each tells equally corny jokes when asked!
i would say that, if i had to get another, i would choose the echo because of the price difference. i could have saved $90 and been just as happy."
94,0,"the google home is super easy to set up and so fun to have in our kitchen area. we play music, games, ask questions and control our music in our home sound system. i do not know how we have lived without this!"
95,14,"so convenient for watching tv, even my toddler can put his favorite shows on the tv when he wants. i use it for media, reminders, alarms, shopping list, questions, jokes, and games."
96,14,"very practical. once you start using it you can not go without it. now i am looking at buying all kind of smart stuff to  make everything fun and easy to run the house. the smart lights makes everything so so much better, it gives you peace of mind."
97,0,"hi i found it easy to install ,great communication and best reasonably priced .."
98,0,easy to install
99,14,"the product itself is great, but needs to bake some more, small range of direct support smart devices, but if you use the samsung smartthings and other addons excellent device."
100,14,"neat little gadget, easy to setup initially. still have not been successful in the voice recognition. it gives me the spinning wheel forever until i cancel operation."
101,14,broaden capabilities to reading the bible or other books etc.
102,14,"i would not have bought this device if i knew it limits you to one account per device.   soooo,  it only assists one person n in a family.   seems so easy for each person to have their own prompt.  and i would not have boughf it if i knew you must say okay google constantly,  can not  change the prompt and it does not exactly roll off the tongue.  i over estimated  google.   and hopes for updates are seemingly poor.   i have a 14 dollar assistant on my phone i will stick with since i missed the boat on echo for same price before xmas.   its a glorified speaker right now.  since i can control tv and music with phone anyway what is  the  point worth  all  these  limitations 
 i do not  even  use ""google  now""   on  my  phone.   was not  thinking."
103,0,"i ordered the alexa dot from amazon for my husband for christmas and we got to try it out for a month. we got tired of hearing hum, i can not help you with that. i returned it and ordered the google home and within the first few minutes we knew it was the right one for us. my husband is really enjoying the ease of asking for music and translations.  we are very happy with google home and think everyone should have one."
104,0,the unit is unreliable. speech recognition is spotty. bought for our blind daughter to have easy access to information and it has been a huge disappointment for her.
105,0,"the music quality is great! the variety, perfect! 
we have had so much fun with google home. we are still learning but in the week we have had this we have had a blast with it!  
we have been pleasantly surprised by the accuracy of the speaker, and how it recognizes our requests.  
can not wait to learn more about it!"
106,14,"i like that you can hook things up to control,lights,tv,music & you can communicate with it!"
107,14,when evar i say ok google she does not answers till the fith time and when you ask her to put on something she plays something completely differnt.
108,0,very quick delivery and item was exactly what i wanted.
109,14,"easy to use, can be customized to my personal tastes."
110,14,"this is pretty much an unnecessary item for me to purchase, but i have been enjoying it. i have customized it so that when i say ""good morning"" it tells me the weather, my time to work and the latest news.  it also will make you lazy!  i can tell it to play any playlist on spotify- my own or one designed by them - and it will find it and play it.  same with any netflix show or movie.  there is more that i am still toying around with, but i am enjoying it so far.  there are alot of apps that have not agreed to partner with this, and i hope that changes."
111,14,"i thought that this google home speaker, had wi-fi built into it , like a router.
google home speaker, ended up only being exactly like the google app. on my smartphone. you can ask it questions, but before every question, you have to say ,""o.k. google"", or it will not work at all.
google home has a microphone built into it, and you can also play you tube music from this device.
too expensive for a device like the google app.!!!"
112,14,"i am writing this in january of 2017.  do not buy this product yet. it is not ready for prime time.  all the great things google search does -- as implied by the family name -- does not exist yet in this product.  so there is little value here, except for perhaps the blue-tooth speaker."
113,0,bought as a gift and i would say it was a hit.  the entire family loves it!
114,0,"these are like an adult toe, once you figure out how to set it up and use it!"
115,14,the reponse time.
116,14,"i am, at this point, disappointed in google home.  it is good for asking it things but if you have a smart phone  you have that.  but my wemo lights are not supported by it, nor is my wifi enabled tv on their list so my extra uses for it are non-existent unless they add more native programs."
117,0,we love it. great buy. so simple to set up and use.  we are going to buy a small one for the bedroom.
118,14,"the google home is a fun gadget to play around with. i do not think the technology is 100% seamless yet but it can be useful for everyday tasks. i use it to listen to podcasts and turn on netflix shows through chrome cast instead of having to fumble with my phone. it also has a solid alarm feature. it is also nice to be able to ask it random questions that i normally would have to type in on google. however, i find that i am often rephrasing the questions multiple times in order to get the answer i want. i think the usefulness will improve over time. loved the easy set up though!"
119,0,"ease of setting up, ease of use.  this thing can answer just about anything."
120,0,"its alot of fun using google home.
my husband has it calling him master. lmao  but for real its a must have for all house  holds. also very informative."
121,0,great products
122,14,"if you want volume, buy the  google home as the main device, and the mini for the adjacent rooms; this has a real clear and loud sound.  i love the fact that, even though my husband and child have not train it yet, the goggle home recognizes their voices(do not know their names without adding their accounts)  now there is a male voice, but i do not like it;  cant wait for this device to come out in spanish! i will buy one for my mom and my sister once is out in spanish. for now, i have lots of fun!  if you want to make full use of all the features get youtube red!  it is awesome!"
123,14,"easy to setup & connect to smart devices, and much more helpful with questions/searches than alexa. (great sound, too.) pairs great with our chromecasts. now that the whole family has voice control of music, movies, thermostat and more, i will be adding minis throughout the house."
124,0,awesome works for me!!
125,0,it was so easy to set up and use!
126,0,this was a gift for my daughter and she is thrilled with it that she convinced me to buy another one. which i did right away
127,14,"its a great product that will amaze you with what it can do. keep it in the kitchen/living room so it helps with measurements for recipes, quick questions, what time stores close so you can run out. of course it is not perfect and frequently does not understand what you are looking for, but i still found it worthwhile to give a second as a gift to my parents."
128,0,this is a useful and fun device. great for hands free productivity in the kitchen. also a great music device. the kids love asking it questions!
129,0,we loved this thing so much we bought 2 more as gift to family members for christmas.  fun for playing music around the house and videos on our tv.  love the weather and commute info in the morning.
130,14,we ask gh very simple questions and cannot get a correct answer.  sometimes we get an answer and it is so long winded we are telling it to stop.  returning this product.
131,0,easy to set up and work with
132,14,"the google home ai/intelligence is way better than echo.  i have both and the home is a much smarter device.  all i get from my echo is ""i am sorry, i do not know the answer to that question"".  

if it is primarily for music, the echo has a better speaker, better sound.  
if it is for automation or you have kids asking about dinosaurs or why the sky is blue, random things, google is way better."
133,14,easiest way to get the weather and phone numbers and how to spell words. it works great to hear what is on my google calendar
134,0,"this thing will not bake cookies but it can call your mom! i loved it so much i bought one for my mother. she has not learned how to surf the net yet, but after i set it up, can use it with ease. she asks it questions all the time!"
135,14,it is fine. works like it says. just do not have a big need for it.
136,0,compact and ease of set up.
137,0,bought this for my niece as a christmas present and she loves it! highly recommend.
138,0,i am still learning how to use it.
139,0,"gave two as gifts recipients liked them,easy to set up. shipping was free and super fast!!"
140,0,"works great.  my 8 year old loves asking questions.  it is responses are fast.  the speaker is good, we use pandora.  can distinguish between voices well.  highly recommended."
141,0,"really cool item, nothing bad at all about it"
142,0,easy setup and super fast learning curve
143,14,very smart assistant. makes tasks like playing videos in youtube and netflix a breeze.
144,0,the quality of the product
145,0,we love google home
146,14,"awesome product, far better than the amazon eco."
147,14,"i have no idea why folks love it ... the voice recognition is t rrific, ev rything else sucks. the app is one of the worst i have ever used, unintuitive and completely lacking in functionality, none of my music services are supported, and there isnt much besides music i would use it for. i keep thinking i must be missing a hidden feature set!

im writing this because i just wanted to play a song - google doesnt recognize this well known pop song so i thought id type it in manually in a search box ... good luck with that, there is no music interface and so no search!"
148,14,had an amazon echo that could not answer or do anything that we wanted. upgraded to this and it does everything we want it to and more.
149,0,"picked a couple up to bring back to canada, got one for my mother in her fifties for her birthday and she loves it!"
150,14,sometimes its a little slow and get stuck. otherwise it works well and it is fun to have around the house!
151,0,this speaker has more definition than my bose speakers.  for its size it pounds out the super sound.  bass is excellent with super highs.  for a hundred dollars its a plus...beats amazon in sound.
152,14,"if you are android family like us. it makes the most sense to use google home. why google is better than amazon for android users? * better integration with your google phone, calendar, google apps etc. * remembers context of your questions, such as google what is on calendar this week? (your trip to portland); google will i need a jacket ""there""? google knows you are talking about portland, whereas alexa gets dumbfounded! * when playing loud music, google picks up the ""ok google"" command from across the room; whereas alexa is a lost cause once you turn up the volume and you are far away. cons: *google still does not have as many partners to integrate light bulbs, locks, thermostats etc. i purchased ecobee and use it via smarthings or iftt. integration with other devices is just a matter of time. so if you are big into getting alexa to turn lights on/off today, you should look towards alexa :)"
153,0,"i love having this for my home. its very easy to set up, pretty cool device"
154,0,wonderful product!!!!
155,0,works great and arrived in good condition. wife and kids love it!
156,14,i love the design and interaction with google home. the responses are much better than alexia and the music sounds better as well. the one area i wish they would improve is the microphone sensitivity.  it does not respond or hear you as well as the amazon products.
157,14,"i have only had google home for two days, but it is living up to my expectations so far."
158,14,just what i wanted
159,0,who does not love google home! was a great christmas gift
160,14,it can give me answers to weather
161,0,excellent product. i recommend. i am enjoying everyday.
162,0,i m getting it for christmas so have not used it yet but i am excited about the possibilities!!
163,14,the fact that it responds so quickly!
164,0,"what it does, and ease of setting it up."
165,0,my granddaughter wants this for christmas. i love it. it is educational as well as fun.
166,0,i love it. but can not get the 25.00  that you had offered. was going to buy another one with that 25.00 for our son
167,14,we have linked it to our kitchen light switch and works awesomely. only downer is we can use certain radio stations that are our go to. have to subscribe to google music to have all access to music. you can use with pandora but have not had too log to see what else it can do.
168,0,best product ever
169,14,the speakers were very good and the call my phone feature is very helpful. linking it to other music stations is also very good. it received 4 stars because you have to subscribe to google play music to listen to a music album.
170,14,"i have had an echo and an echo dot and been very happy.
the lack of apps for the home is disappointing .

but what i find the most irritating is having to say
"" ok google "" time after time.
 having to say "" ok google "" over and over becomes a real pain."
171,0,everything about it . its very cool .
172,0,i love it!   speaker is so much better than the echo.
173,14,"excellent choice, bought it to compare to my current amazon alexa, the google is far more  intelligent, responsive, outruns alexa by far....

with one exception, the sound quality of the amazon alexa is superior in quality and louder, which is not a big factor after all."
174,14,"every operation is just so easy, the sound quality is amazing, and the microphone picks up my voice through other sounds quite easily. if i speak too soft however (""snooze for 5 more minutes"" in the morning, for example) it does not always catch it (it is about 3 yards away from my bed). but when i call it from the other room loud enough (not shouting, just putting up a loud voice) it hears me."
175,0,"corners of the items box were damaged like it had been dropped, the delivery box was not damaged which leads be to believe it did not be happen during delivery. i have not opened it because it is a gift so i have saved my receipt incase it does not work. other than that i love the product itself."
176,0,it is amazing product home sound good quality   thank you for google !
177,14,excellent voice recognition.
178,0,we love it. we bought another one for our parents. they love it and enjoy listing to music and asking it questions.
179,14,"what you are not told is that you need to subscribe to get music you want to something like pandora and definitely to youtube. so if you want to know some things like the weather, time and som recipes this is fine. a lot of questions will direct you to a web site so have paper and pen ready. we returned it after one week."
180,0,"so this was my christmas present to myself, hook up was very easy which i appreciate. i have not used it a lot but the little bit that i have i absolutely love it. i can not wait to get my smart plug in is hooked up to it. i think the sale price was the best part and the real reason i bought it. can not wait to see all it can do. very happy with my purchase."
181,0,"first unir bad out of the box, google techs were no help. had to get supervisor to resolve problem which was to admit unit was bad. supervisor agreed to change out the unit but never got the email google said they would send with information..  finally took unit back to local walmart and got a new one. have not hooked up the new one yet."
182,0,"we have just had google home for a week and are having communication problems.  we have to ask a question in a way it understands.  we are learning and so is google home!
we were specifically interested in help with difficult crosswords clues  and that has not yet been done.  so, this is a process and we are just starting."
183,14,you can have the tv on and it hears you. i like that it has two voices to choose from.  excited to control a lamp by voice too.
184,14,"sound and ease of use after installation.  i did have significant problems in getting started,however.  mostly on getting my wi-fi synchronized with my i-6 phone and the new google home........needed outside help...... much of this problem was my own unfamiliarity with the phone.....new to me.

john c"
185,0,delivery was good.  arrived in perfect condition.  just learning to use google home but so far i love i
186,14,"this is a gift, but i have one. it could be better and do things the other (?) product does. it does sync with my nest so that is why i gave it a 4 star"
187,0,i bought this for a friend that raved about ours.  the price was incredible.  i know they will enjoy it.  it is a great product.
188,0,"very intuitive, easy to set up."
189,14,it does not respond with as much information as alexa
190,14,"very responsive.  way too responsive even if i wasnt the one saying ""hey google"" or ""ok google"".  it even responds and reacts to google commercials on tv."
191,14,"great voice recognition technology, fun voice-activated games, and ability to link music streaming accounts make this a really great gadget.  the sound quality out of the big speaker is also really great."
192,14,all about it .  need to add lighting now!
193,0,great helper
194,14,"google home is a fun device and i would readily recommend & give it 5 stars if the setup app worked properly.  while the setup app is easy to use, it simply does not work properly.  it refused to connect to my wireless router -  i finally had to connect it to another one.  i followed the instructions in the setup app exactly as indicated, but still had to run it 3 times, reboot the home device, and wait about 30 minutes before it suddenly began working.   frankly, i expecte much better from google.  perhaps an amazon echo would have been a better choice."
195,14,"everything!  we have not had it long enough to put all the features to use yet, but this is going to be great!  love the question answering, playing music of my choice, finding the cell phone when we misplace it, and making hands-free phone calls.  it also selects the netflix programs we want to watch."
196,14,"fun to chat with goog.  but, the absence of instructions causes concern.  for example, how to add a grocery list, how to know that it is linked to my phone to check appointments.  there are other areas that there are no explanations on how to get there."
197,14,i love electronics but did not know what i could use this for. i have a five year old that asks me to spell things all the time!  now he can have google spell anything anytime! lol it also worked with our wemo switches and some of our other electronics. it is awesome and do not know what i did without it!
198,0,i have 4 now and i am sure more to equip each room with one.
199,0,google home really is amazing. get one and be blown away.
200,0,so excited to find google home at a great price at sams club and ordering was so easy.
201,14,google home is great. manages my chromecast and hue lights. and answers questions.
202,14,can not really give a review for this product will be a christmas gift.  it looks nice but did not really try it.
203,14,not nearly as good as my amazon echo. frequently does not understand simple requests. google really needs to up the speech algorithms they use. the only reason i keep it is because it can (with many many requests reworded in different ways) play the my music from google play. otherwise i would have returned it by now.
204,14,"it is clear that google released google home before it was completely ready but it is also clear that it will eventually do a lot more than it does today.  useful right out of the box but missing some basic functions (like reminders) and it does not work with as many home automation devices as alexa. nevertheless, i bought this because it is powered by google and. let is face it, they are the 800 lb gorilla of information.  i ask this things tons of questions on a daily basis and it is generally helpful (though not 100%).

i recommend using ifttt with is as it extends its functionality quite nicely.  works well with my harmony remote using ifttt.  

add a few more functions and i give it that missing fifth star."
205,14,"it is on right now. it is becoming a sidekick, although it shuts itself down without reason and does not know why."
206,0,"this device is absolutely amazing. the interface of voice is getting more popular simply because it is just so easy to use. having this device around as an adult lot of value to my life, and it helps me to be way more efficient."
207,0,convenient and easy to use
208,5,stylish degign
209,14,"not worth it.  okay, so i do not understand those complaining about difficulties with voice recognition and set up challenges.  my guess is user error.  my complaint is that once the novelty wears off (the day after the return policy expires) there is not much value.   the search results give either a long winded answer, answer to everything but what you asked, or none at all.  surprisingly no answer at all is typical.  the games are lame.  playing music is okay but the sound quality after lowering the volume just sounds muffled like someone placed a towel over it.  

my biggest complaiint after one year ownership:  i set two daily alarms to remind me to take my medicine.  it worked great and i never missed a pill.  the meds are done but the alarms will not stop. this is not user error.  i previously had daily alarms that i successfully canceled.  there must have been an ¡®upgrade' and/or software change.  who knows? what i do know is that these darn alarms go off.  everyday.  i will say ¡°okay google, cancel all daily alarms' and it will confirm that all alarms are canceled.  i will immediately ask ¡°okay google, what alarms do i have?'  it will confirm that no alarms are pending.  the very next dog gone day the same alarms go off. 

here is my second biggest complaint that should be first:  when i use the google search for user complaints about google home.....all of the top results are from google and how amazing this product is.  all consumer complaints are suppressed.  the one time bing is useful is to search for google complaints...go figure.  from bing  i have others with similar complaints and said a factory still did not fix the problem.  the alarms seem to be linked through the user profile not the actual device.

save yourself time, money, and frustration and just an extra five seconds to take your phone out of your pocket.  meanwhile i will be unplugging this listening device from my home because privacy is key."
210,14,being able to ask google questions or for it to turn on music is the best. as soon as i have a question i can ask it without trying to find my phone and take the time focus search for it myself.
211,0,works great. got for my elderly dad who can not use internet very well
212,0,"a lot more fun and useful than i thought it would be. bought it for my wife, she loves it."
213,14,it is plays all the music i love when i ask
214,14,"cheaper than alexa and definitely better at answering your random questions, google home is a great assistant if you do not mind that it looks like an air freshener. the lights are actually pretty cool and you can use ""hey google"" as opposed to ""ok google"" as your trigger."
215,0,so far my family is loving google home. my kids use it more then the adults. it is very kid friendly and im suprised that it is able to understand them.
216,0,easy to set up and use.
217,14,i love this. now i have my  personal  assistant lol
218,0,easy to use. convenient.
219,14,it is so easy to set up and use.  it sits on the counter in the kitchen and does not take up much room.  i especially love asking google to play music constantly.  this device is fantastic.
220,14,"constantly improving tech, works with all my home applications and sounds terrific when i use it to play music.  what is not to like?"
221,0,"responses tailored to the voice that it hears!  when my wife asks for her agenda her calendar is accessed.  when i ask, my calendar is accessed."
222,14,"decent audio and gets quite loud. however, i do not know that it is worth the premium over the mini. if you do not listen to music on it a lot the mini would be the better choice."
223,14,a decent sounding speaker but ultimately redundant with the android phone in my pocket.
224,0,i enjoyed the way google home works.  it was very nice to know i could change it from a women voice to a man voice
225,14,really loved. the ability to connect with your chromecast it is awesome!. first time i feel i own an smarttv
226,14,very easy to use.  google home answers questions accurately even with a lot of background noise and multiple people talking.  responses are fast too.
227,14,i love this one. makes my life so much easier
228,0,i love my google home.  i have had a lot of fun with it.
229,14,it is a good product that works as advertised
230,0,easy to use!  not a very tech savvy guy but this was easy to set up and fun to use.  love the random and fun facts it tells you.
231,0,very handy. gives  info without having to look it up.  wide variety of music . schedule reminders.
232,0,good purchase does what i need. useful information.
233,14,it is use full in many ways
234,14,she likes it
235,0,"is a great product, works as it should. easy to set up and synch with my google profile."
236,14,"there is a learning curve,  what all can you ask?
where do you find any help"
237,14,"very cool.  sound is beautiful, and it is a lot of fun to play with."
238,0,ease if use and helpfulness!
239,0,so easy and fun
240,14,"yes,we play trivia,music,keep a shopping list."
241,0,it is a functional speaker and has good quality sound. fun and interactive.
242,0,not sure how it works yet. bought this for a christmas gift. price was awesome though. thanks for the deal
243,14,lots of i am still learning answers
244,0,works great learning all the tine
245,0,i love everything about it!
246,14,this is a nice and emerging technology. there are thijgs that google should have done before release. they mentioned that you can add things to uiur calen but it is not available yet. theu should have waited to release it and made sure all features were avao at launch. overall it is a fun device that adds a bluetooth speaker to your home or office. the commands are simple and it is responsive. the microphone works at a good distance. there are games and one of the best features is working with other devices in the home such as lighting and your tv with chromecast.
247,0,easy to set up and use.
248,0,great product easy to set-up
249,0,"everything! it is such a fun toy! great sound system to play music during parties, great toy to play with my other google toy."
250,14,fun device operates many home features
251,14,"a little hard to setup because my iphone was out of date to log into google to get the app needed.
it would have been helpful to know the equipment requirements before purchase."
252,0,great product at a great price.
253,0,my kids love it...very helpful with homework
254,0,very useful great music  great info
255,0,it is was easy to set up and use.
256,0,works great
257,14,"google home is not as capable as ""amazon echo"" in controlling household appliances. it is very limited at this time but the knowledge base of google home is way far crom ""amazon echo"". before buying, consider first on what you gonna do with the device...controlling household appliance or use it for ""information only"". 
 and also, if you have android phone near google home...both of them will listen to your command."
258,0,"i bought one for my wife and she loves it. the 6 months commercial free youtube was worth it. my daughter loved it to, so we bought her one as well,"
259,0,wayyyyyy better than the amazon echo
260,14,access to youtube compared to alexa
261,14,i like the availability of instant news and music of my own choosing
262,14,music services are on point.
263,0,it is amazing how it works.
264,14,this is a christmas gift and can not really comment on quality of product just yet.  i am expecting it to be fantastic.
265,14,i love how we can use google home to help plan our day by reading my calendar. the multi-user support is amazing as well. we plan to connect our samsung smart devices to vacuum on command.
266,0,sound quality for a unit that size
267,14,this device is great. you might not know what to do with it at first but you quickly get used to having it around. it is like living in the future.
268,14,"it works quite well. especially once you get to using ifttt commands (via iphone app for me). using lifx bulbs and wemo wall switch by this method. works a treat. 

recognizes commands/questions very well

only issue so far is it picking up random phrases occasionally on tv as an activation phrase

speaker quality is top notch"
269,0,"i liked how easy it was to setup. hardware-wise, same as most other thermometers. overall, i liked it though a bit on the pricey side."
270,14,"if you have children, this device is awesome. play games, sing songs, noise machine, ask questions, the list goes on."
271,14,this thing keeps the house in order and music as well.
272,14,"this is a great smart speaker.  the sound quality is good for its size and works well in bedroom and kitchen.  the quality of the voice recognition and the answers are much better than the alexa we also own.  we use it to control lights, smart thermostat and casting to the tv and stereo.  updates from google are frequent and provide new functionality.  if you use google services, this is the smart speaker for you."
273,0,poor
274,14,"the google home device has been great so far. the best feature i like is the ability to ask for a certain kind of music and google seems to know exactly what i want. other great features i like is when sitting around the table with my 4 children the google home is very helpful with homework questions. 

the only thing i would like to see is the link between my iphone and other devices

the alarm i think should be on a different audio setting than the device itself. the alarm is not loud enough. 

i definitely see this device well worth the money and it is future uses increasing."
275,14,love it. own two.
276,14,i have never had the echo but i bought the google home instead my first impression is it is very responsive to voice and questions i  like it so far and i am sure it will get better found out well doing research that it can control lights and plugs and other home automation devices since i have some of the devices it controls i tried it so now when i want to turn up temp in house i tell google set temp to  70. i bought a second one for my kids house and may get another for me as they update it
277,14,"the voice recognition is very good and has decent reachability within a typical apartment bedroom. provides a decent set of services like maps (eta only), show times, uber, pandora, google music to name a few.. 

feel looks soft and build is decent and fits well with my furniture in the room (ymv depending on the furniture color and texture) 

all in all satisfied with the price and product."
278,14,this is a good product if you like your conversations to be recorded even when its off
279,14,"recently brought the google home and i must say im very impressed with it! sound quality for a little speaker is quite amazing, it answers all my questions with ease, and is a great alarm clock, its early days for the home and it will be rolled out across the world by the end of 2017, and it will get better and better! google have sold more homes in one month than amazon did with the echo in six months! 
here is video what is in the box! if you want go and check it out:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9_qly8vs-k"
280,0,is great but not sure how to program it for things i want to use it for! came with no directions
281,14,"this is great! the only drawback is the minimal electronics that you can use with it currently. i know other companies will be jumping on the bandwagon for this. there are some that do not advertise it, yet, but their products will work with the google home. if you are familiar with the ifttt site, google home can use some of these pre-programmed apps to shutoff/on lights and other things. it responds to your commands like you are talking to a person, whereas the amazon echo needs specific statements."
282,14,"i bought this for my husband since his heart is always for apple but he likes to play with all the tech toys. this way he could have a google home without feeling guilty for wasting money on it. he set it up easily and we have found it to be a lot more useful than we ever expected. especially since our hands out usually full with a newborn baby. google has answered questions about newborns sneezing, played songs to lull/dance with the baby too, and tells me the time for breastfeeding all at a simple voice command.  she is also become part of our morning routine in just one week as we are feeding/changing the baby she tells us the weather and starts our news briefing from our chosen sources. we have both been rather impressed overall and as regular users of siri and alexa, we did not think we would be. well done google."
283,14,"i ask it for many thinks and keep say sorry i can'r help you with, or i still learning it obvious that it really is a disappointment for me"
284,14,easiest electronic to set up that i have ever bought.  the ability to have appointments for 3 family members just a request away is so very helpful and convenient!  i can get time and temperature anytime and ask questions that most of the time the google assistant can answer.  best thing ever and would recommend to those who could use a bit of help in keeping up with appointments or just having the ability to obtain information by just asking!!
285,14,"questions and commands have to be phrased in a certain way or else they will not br understood, but i expected that. you also have to pause a little bit after waking it up before you ask a question or give a command.  i expected response to be a bit faster, but i can deal with it as it is.  overall, very satisfactory.  we are learning more about it is capabilities."
286,14,"i always hated when people take out their smart phones to check a fact. now i can check basic information in my kitchen, have translations and animal sounds for the small ones. i believe that the smart phone will be less and this kind of voice recognition systems more.
if you accept the creepy always listening part, then we can recommend the permanent google presence in your house."
287,14,"first off, kudos to walmart for it is ""pick it up today"" service.  during the height of holiday shopping all i had to do was purchase online (so i was sure it was in stock) and just go down and pick it up without any waiting, searching or drama.  great system!

as far as the google home product it is absolutely amazing. we have not even scratched the surface of it is current capabilities and google has not even scratched the surface of it is future capabilities.  it is fun (has games, jokes and wisecrack responses). it is smart (answers nearly every question we threw at it). it is intuitive (i requested a song by merely singing a line from the song and after playing the song it kept playing similar music until i asked it to stop).  the sound is really good for such a small unit. nice bass.  it is also amazing how far away from it i can be and it still works. i was telling my wife in our bedroom about what i had just said to it and it picked it up all the way from the living room and responded. it is also really an attractive addition to the decor.

as you might have picked up i was very pleased.  so much so that we bought one for both our son and daughter for christmas."
288,0,the set up was so easy.
289,14,got google home for my girlfriend for xmas. the whole family had fun with it. her parents and her daughter.  the only thing that i disliked was that the volume was hard to get to go up and down. we kept saying. ok google. turn the music up or down.  and it seemed like it was having trouble understanding. but all in all it is a cool item. we still use it but not as much as thought we would. but for 150 you can not really complain.
290,14,"glad i got this product. i got the first one and liked it so well i bought another
only problem is there seems to be some type of price fix because i have been unable to purchase one for under $129.00  seems funny all stores have same price and they are not available at the two large membership clubs"
291,0,"i purchased four of these  for christmas.  three were gifts for my children and their families and on was for myself.  google home was easy to install and i had it up and running within a matter of minutes.  a great value, the sound quality of the music is excellent.  now, my grand daughters may wear google out with their constant questions and request for music, but so far it is working excellently! :-)"
292,14,"i also have a dot and alexa.  the dot is the best.... (not for sound) with google home it pop is and crackle. when playing my local radio. google does not have as many app is and does not do as much as dot & alexa.  google technicians need to get to work!!!!!!
if i had purchased google home i would take it back for a refund. but as a gift it works good in the kitchen."
293,0,i purchase the groupon because i thought it would be a nice product to get and i liked it very much ever since i got home it is been very it was easy to set up and very easy years it is had a couple of glitches though but it was pretty minor i just had to reset it and stop working for a bit and then i just unplugged it and plugged it back in so i would recommend it to others is a very fun product to use.
294,0,"we bought a google home for ourselves (we are in our 60 is) and use it to answer questions and play music. it works perfectly for that.
we bought each of our adult children one for xmas knowing they would get the same enjoyment we do out of it plus they are more tech savvy than us to add things like lights, chromecast etc. 
we feel it is a great gift idea, we even bought one for a  20 year old granddaughter away at college."
295,0,"in puerto rico non functional. even if you ask gooogle what is the fee for a us passport renewal it comes back with the fee in british pound. 

anything you ask about puerto rico all  she answer is sorry i am still learning.  in example: who was the 3rd governer... her spanish pronounciation is too bad. even when you ask for temperature she comes back in c and not in f.

i end up returning the product."
296,0,"easy set up, very responsive, and intuitive.  i like that it is compact and not annoying, will play my favorite music and so much more."
297,14,works really well. it is a lot of fun. the game show is fun to play. lots of trivia questions. is not too accurate when taking music requests after the you tube red free trial is over. that part i do not like. but overall it is a pretty awesome unit.
298,14,"sounds great!!  
 my daughter and i love it. 

 we love music & it plays just about any song  thru u tube red. 

the device comes with a free 6 month free trial of utube red 
not sure how much access to music we will have after free trial is up. 

google home will pay trivia games with you which my 16 year old daughter really loved. 

i would definitely recommend google home to a friend."
299,0,the google home work perfect for me.  for litten music
300,14,while not perfect this really is an excellent entry level product. we played with it for hours asking it loads of questions. while working on the computer i often have to stop and go seek information. this has filled that need most of the time. i purchased this for fun and now am using it as a timesaver business tool.
301,14,"i love this thing,,,,the only downside is that in order to get the most out of it you still have to spend more money and wait for future updates ,,,i have it connected to philips hue lights,, another expense but it works beautiful,,,hey, google, turn lights off/on,,,dim lights,change color light ect,,,,i got it connected to my tv ,,,,another expense for the logitech harmony hub with remote but works  nicely,,,ok google ,,tv off/on in living room or bedroom tv ,,,3 chromecast audio connected to different speakers around house ,then create a home group and ,ok google play  music on home group and all speakers playing or choose which chromecast  to play music from,,,it takes some time to setup and patience but worth it, plus lots of digging on info on internet to make it right,,happy headaches, ,,"
302,14,easy to set up i purchased some wifi smart outlets  (wemo) and wifi smart bulbs  (geeni) from wal-mart through google express 20% coupon came with the google home app they all work great without a hub
303,0,is the best thing i could have ever bought myself this year i love it it answers everything i need it wakes me up it is just the best thing in my house
304,0,"gives me a lot of joy this toy, together with the cromcast audio i enjoy streaming music to my receiver and hearing music through my speakers."
305,14,"we had purchased an echo for our son and wanted to see how google was going to do the same kind of assistant.  the news, sports, weather timers and some fun stuff had made this worthwhile but we are looking forward to the unit getting smarter as time goes on.  we use the music and enjoy that and have her run a trivia game from time to tim."
306,14,"sound quality is good. better than the echo.  has to play music from a premium account like spotify or youtube red, or your personal library. we have all those so no biggie. but if you dont have any set up and only have amazon prime, you are gonna just want to get the echo. main issue i have is it usually only responds to my husbands voice and if the volume is over 8, forget about it responding at all. i do not like that it has to have 100% full access to my phone just to set up a shopping list, for, now i will be doing my shopping list the old fashion way. otherwise it cokes in handy for wanting music for,my disabled son, or looking up nutrition information while cooking."
307,14,"love 99% of what this does for us.  searches, weather, news, music, fun games, etc...
every once in a while, she starts talking to us, so we sound like we are saying ok google.  great addition to our family."
308,14,"this thing is so cool.it dose all the stuff for me. it play is my music,set is timers and everything else."
309,14,"i have truly enjoyed the google home.  as well as offering some fun, it is useful in keeping lists, reminders, and notes. it is great as an alarm and a timer, and listening to music is enjoyable.   i am looking forward to increased things that googlewill add to the capabilities"
310,14,"does exactly what i needed., which is looking up stuff and answering questions from across the room.  i have not tried it for anything else, but it does that well."
311,0,the product arrived on time and intact.  the product came with easy to read and follow instructions and the item was able to be set up for use within minutes.
312,14,"gives you instant results from news and weather to music and videos. still behind amazon alexa as far as what it can all do, but close. if you do not want to spend a lot and still have most features as alexa, google home is your best option."
313,0,"this was a christmas gift for my husband who is not a tecky.
once i did the setup, it works great.  he loves it.  as his eyesight is not as good as it use to be, this voice command works wonderful for him.
setup was very easy with no complications."
314,14,"very helpful in answering general questions and reporting weather forecasts. also has 3 game functions (mad libs, trivia with up to 4 people, and crystal ball). i also like that i can easily stream music from a mobile device to the google home speaker."
315,0,was very difficult to set up.  finally gave up and returned the item.
316,14,great sound!  i use it a lot for play music and radio stations.  interesting that amazon prime does not show google home when i searched for it.
317,14,"i bought this on a lark, but have become quite enamored with it.  plays music on demand from spotify, helps manage my grocery list, and turns off and on my smart devices. takes getting used to talking to an object, but once you get over the hump, its great! highly recommended."
318,14,it is no amazon echo. this thing is barely compatible with any of my home automation devices. it can do all the basic stuff that the echo could do years ago. do yourself a favor and just go buy two echo dots for the price of this garbage.
319,14,love using this site!
320,14,the google home is a great product.  it is both fun and useful.  i use it for everything from checking the weather to keeping my grocery list.  i believe the functionality will continue to grow.
321,14,"in no time at all i had it controlling my; ac, lights, and tv.  it helps to be somewhat technical."
322,14,"love the google home assistant, does everything i need to control my devices, plays music and anytime i want to look some thing up, google home can get me an answer, love this device!"
323,0,"we love our new google home device. voice recognition works pretty well, and both adults and children alike are fully using most features. would definitely recommend to others."
324,14,"worked simply and instantly right out of the box.  if this is where technology is headed, all of us are in for some exciting times!  ok google becomes a hands-free entry into so much information, music, etc.  enjoy."
325,0,nice thing
326,0,got this for my parents for christmas they have enjoyed playing with it for 8 months now.
327,14,"we love the music that it plays and the sound is outstanding too!  at a voice command we can listen to news , weather forecast, and much more."
328,0,the intelligent speech recognition is awesome. i was impressed by the number and variety of commands it understands. we love playing christmas music on spotify and it fills our living room perfectly.
329,0,google records when not asked to
330,14,we are having a lot of fun with this. can not answer all your questions but we have not set up all the accessories yet.
331,0,great!!
332,14,"great stuff from google. looking forward for future updates and more device compatibilty which is very limited right now.
other than that, shipping was fast, just great."
333,0,arrived in perfect shape. great packaging. very easy setup. works flawlessly. should only get better with time.
334,14,"google  assistance,  was a pleasant surprise.  i  purchased  echo early on when there was a waiting list.   the voice on ga is really friendly  and when it can not answer a question,  the reply is i have not learn that yet.  i  like the color,  it does not stick out and being smaller is great."
335,0,so much fun the granddaughter loves it the dogs are intrigued by the animals sounds google can make and she is learning as we go.
336,14,pretty impressive. still learning and over time should be even better. works very well with hue lights.
337,0,"it works great, its fun and it sounds great to, can not wait to get other items to go with it."
338,14,"works well, still new so not as many services supported. i can expect more supported soon."
339,0,it is been fun setting it up. it has a lot of potential
340,0,this was a great investment and gift for the entire family.
341,14,"i have now purchased two google home is. they are an incredible device. if you want o automate your home or just use it to gain information, drink ideas, dinner and recipes. this is the product for you. best part, i am not locked into one retailers ecosystem and can choose who to shop with, if i enable the shopping features."
342,0,perfect for tech lovers... highly recommended!!
343,14,excellent gadget
344,14,"my complaints with this are: 1) the alarm even at max volume is not very loud at all. and the alarm sound is a very mellow sound. more of a sound that puts you to sleep, not wake you up! 2) not set up yet for reminders. 3) when playing music, and i ask google to stop, it can not hear me, and i am yelling stop! i have to get up and go tap the top of it to stop the music. 4) unable to look up tv schedules. but overall, i am happy with google home. i think it has some bugs as mentioned to be worked out. but it has a ton of knowledge. ask it most anything. music sounds great. and you can talk with it very natural. get your weather in seconds. i sure wished we could give each google home it is own name instead of having to say hey google all of the time."
345,14,"it is been said google home resembles an air freshener, but in its present form, it serves less of a useful function.  the unit uses a truncated google assistant compared to the functions you get from the google bar on your phone, and it is ""future home"" functions are very limited and the required  add-on devices are limited and can be quite costly.  the ok google trigger word often is not heard the first time and you end up feeling like a maniac as your voice gets louder and angrier when it does not respond as wanted.  it has trouble finding songs in my google play music library, and there are many things that it does not know how to do yet.  unlike the amazon echo interface which has add-ons called skills that you can enable.  google home can only be updated as google adds features.  
the price is too high for this, what feels like a pre-beta release!  the deals from black friday at $99 is even too high for what this currently is.  considering you can get an amazon echo dot for $49 which does and understands a lot more, it is hard to justify the price tag.  even amazon is original echo device which is normally at $189 is a better functioning deal in that the 360 degree speaker blows the google home speaker away, and does so much more."
346,14,the ability to be able to control with just the sound of your voice!
347,14,"this is a great quality item and the built-in speaker puts out a clear, strong sound. my 14 year old son set up everything and it is easy to use. we own 4 of them now so everyone in our family can enjoy their own music and operate different lights in the house. we also hooked up the phillips hue lighting system and the chromecast ultra to work with our google home. it is great for my 85 years young dad to use and he can now enjoy movies and documentaries on the tv without having to use all of the different remotes to get it. all he has to do is tell google home to play it on the tv for him! we are very happy with all aspects of this great addition to our home. we were so happy with ours, we gave the neighbor one!!"
348,14,"we got our google home about a month ago and weighed its purchase vs. amazon is echo. while the google home does not have as much functionality of the echo yet... the sound quality is outstanding and because google is ""open-source,"" we believe it will have as many if not more functionality very soon. there is no comparison between google is assistant who answers in full sentences and is lots of fun to chat with at parties. it does integrate with nest, google keep (a list and organizer like evernote), and many other products. we are very pleased with its purchase and are looking forward to seeing what else it can do over the next year."
349,0,such a great light! thanks
350,14,"forgive me i have no clue of what this item really can do, but when i see that you can do a search, well can not my cellular device do this same thing?????"
351,14,"we have two amazon echos and love them.  they have great sound, and have apps that let me access, review and add to my google calendar, and hundreds of other free available applets.  i bought this thinking that it would let me have greater integration and control of my various google/android products.  we use g-suite (formerly google apps for business) at my office, which is a business suite sharing gmail, calendars, etc.  unfortunately, google home will not access any of this.  so, echo is better in this regard.  likewise, echo has a far superior speaker and sound for playing music, and even voice interaction.  i will stick with the echo until something changes."
352,14,not sure how i lived before google home. love the news / weather updates and alarm functionality; have even used it to successfully create a calendar. i decided to buy this since i use google products in my life quite a bit and i do not necessarily buy a lot in ecommerce. [this review was collected as part of a promotion.]
353,14,"this is almost as amazing as they say. do not get  me wrong...i love it. so far i have had 3 friends buying it because of my excitement about it. the shopping list is great...syncs right to my phone.  she is good for a laugh sometimes with her answers (the jokes are a little corny)...but i did not buy it for that.
i just thought the calendar assistant would be working a lot better. i use the google calendar.
it would be great if she told of new updates. i do ask her if she learned anything new.
sometimes she can give me a recipe....sometimes she ""does not know how to help with that.""  hmmmmm
i have until feb. to return it if i feel that it is not what i wanted it for."
354,0,i bought this a month ago and the whole family is happy with it.
355,14,"i liked it a lot. it lets me do google search via voice. it searches youtube videos and casts to my tv. it sets temperature on my nest thermostat. we use mainly for setting timers, hearing news/weather . we can verde with google home normal language as its good with context based searches. as this is ai based, it should become even easy to converse with it with time."
356,0,"the item i received was dead on arrival. i can not send it back because it was shipped overseas. btw, those units were going for $79 on black friday and cyber monday :("
357,14,"this is my second google home, this one is for my lake condo. it is almost always on, great for music, timer, source of information, etc, etc. great product."
358,14,"product works awesome! simply take out of box, plug it in,  download googlehome.com on your phone, home computer, tablet, google home will pick it up (like bluetooth) and ask away!
i bought this for my mother, for when she was a little girl she had to use an  encyclopedia to get answers. lol
she loves it so easy to ask a question and get a quick answer or even ask it to play one of her favorite songs i downloaded for her.
now she wakes up asks it about the days weather, news, appointments, heck i even install a nest on the wall now it can control the heat and cooling!
yes i would recommend this product  to kids up to the elderly!"
359,14,"will not except my wifi, makes it useless. waste of money"
360,14,this little gadget is incredible.  the sound is great.  i love listening to music on it.  great sound.  in the morning i am greeted by name and told what is happening in my day.  and the alarm sound for waking up is so good my husband gave up his alarm clock.  i highly recommend this item.
361,0,the product is great. very informative. shipping was fast.
362,14,"setting this gizmo was easy until one gets to the wifi connection. you must have your own private wifi, otherwise it wont connect. call your internet provider and create your own private wifi.  once it was set up, i could not listen to my music, you have to listen to the music capabilities that it comes, only, you tube(if you have an account, google music play, spotify and pandora.  
aol email is not yet included in this device. so to listen to your emails. 
i suggest you wait until they make it much better.
i do have fun asking silly questions, but one can do that in the internet."
363,14,does not run on windows
364,14,ok but not too impressed.  returned the unit.
365,14,"it advertised that you can connect with your phone,but it will nothe work unless you have wifi!"
366,14,ok google ... good google
367,0,"this thing seriously comes in handy. at first i thought i would never use it, but man, i really do and it works really well!"
368,14,i just purchase a google home and i like the size and the fact that you can change the base of it to other colors. it is very similar to the amazon echo. the echo at the moment does more than the home does. but i think after time that will not be the case. you can use it to turn on your lights and some appliances in your house and you can also use multiple ones in different rooms and they will not interfere with each other. where is the amazon echo has that problem. but that is because it is new on the market and of course google has not worked out quite all the bugs yet but i am sure they will.
369,14,"this item works great so far. it can answer most questions  and if you have smartthings by samsung it can be integrated to control my nest thermostat. the only cons are its not wireless, bluetooth compatible, and if the music is too loud sometimes google  will not hear you.  once it gains some ""skills"" and can do things like set reminders it will be amazing.  would buy again."
370,14,unable to download app to my android phone. taking it back to wallys
371,0,this gadget is ok at best. really not worth the money spent.
372,14,mislead!! not able to play an individual song when asked! echo dot can!!!
373,14,it does everything and makes me so happy!  hope to get one in each room!
374,14,"i was not sure what i would think of google home. my kids were very excited and pushed me to get it and i am glad i did.  at a basic level it handles music very well and expands our choices beyond my owned catalog.  it also handles questions (searches) well.  allows us to answer questions and add some data to dinner table conversations.  i do not have any smart appliances or lights so not sure how well that works.  i am looking forward to some ecommerce integrations soon.  

note: written by a walmart employee."
375,14,"this is was gift for christmas, had trouble with it connecting to my wi-fi (was not a wi-fi issue) finally connected after about 15 tries. worked for about a hour then we heard a pop and static throughout various plays. unplugged a couple of times did not work. i did love it while it did work. going to see if i can exchange for the same. if still having the issue i am purchasing an echo."
376,14,"i wanted mood music to go along with daily activities like dinner or exercise.  this little buddy tries its heart out.  its limitation is that is cannot access all music, undoubtedly due to copyright laws, unless you want to pay for a particular service.  the sound is fabulously rich for such a little thing...no tininess.  it has the added bonus that you ask it about the weather or other questions when you think of them, and it just interrupts the current song for a few moments.  beware, you must have a wireless system for it to work."
377,14,"not very impressed with google home so far. have tried repeatedly to get it to connect with my calendar, to no avail.  i would like it to be able to read my calendar for appointments, birthdays, etc.
ask it to remind me to take my pills at a certain time and it said it could not do that at this time. i had to set a timer instead. it would be better if it could tell me to take my pills. perhaps it will be able to do that in the future with upgrades.
it is good for information and weather forecasts."
378,14,"i love this product, the language translation is very nice for us since our son goes to a french school and it will translate french words and phrases. it will even translate french into english!!!! 

i also tend to look up a lot of useless stuff like ""when babe ruth retired"" and i can ask home that kind of stuff and it will tell me so i am not on my phone as much.

this product is only 2 months old while alexa is over 2 years old and alexa cannot do most of the stuff google home can do unless u wanna order more t.p!! google home will only get smarter."
379,14,"i bought google home as a last minute christmas gift for my husband since he commented on how nice it would be to have every time he saw the commercial. after reading and comparing reviews between google and echo, google was an all around favorite. the price was better and another option echo does not have, is you can turn the ""listening"" off, so it is not constantly listening. google more accurately provided responses too according to reviews. we are still learning everything this product can do, but so far love the quick ability to get answers to pretty much any question and listen to instant music. you can use a variety of platforms-you tube, pandora, etc. one thing to note, this products response time is dependent on your internet connection and speed, so if your internet is slow, it does not function as well and will pause as a song plays and the response time is slower. the only other thing i noticed was it does not ""hear"" you if the volume is turned all the way up. it has a touch control top though and you can control features such as volume here as well. various volume settings allow for listening throughout our home.  set up was very easy. google will also interact with you and tell jokes, mad libs, and trivia. my 9 yr old son gets a kick out of it and loves it. we look forward to adding more features such as the ability to control lighting. my only con- i wish i would have purchased it during black friday when it was on sale."
380,0,"i love this ""toy"".  very new because it does not have everything set up for it yet. the price is right! that is excellent! yet, it is still very new technology that just came out yesterday. if you are patient worth technology and want it because of the excellent price, this is what you need."
381,14,"setup for this was a breeze! i love the convenience and fun of using my google home. i can not wait to get more smart devices i can connect it to. the best part is being able to play my music and the speaker is phenomenal. flip a coin, give me the weather, play a game, tell a joke, look something up, what is on my calendar, add to my shopping list, play the news, say goodnight, even sing happy birthday and so much more. love it! thank you google and wal-mart!"
382,14,"i have owned an alexa for over a year now but decided to get a home as well. they are quite similar - especially in terms of functionality they basically do the same things. but, i enjoy google home more because she has a personality - builds humor into her responses (for example, ask her if she is a democrat or a republican!). the biggest con is the only way to wake her up for an interaction is by saying ""ok google"" and that gets old fast. overall, i highly recommend google home assistant as your new home companion!"
383,14,you cannot sync your music to it.  it does not understand many commands.  i wish i had gone with the amazon alexa.
384,14,this item was not compatible with our wifi. the description did not tell us that you had to pay for some of the services.
385,14,still learning. [this review was collected as part of a promotion.]
386,14,i was expecting that i will get flexibility to attach more apps with this and can created custom apis like we have in echo but nothing is there and also you can not play your song app. i think this is starting face in future will get some more flexibility. but i will return this for now.
387,0,"bought the amazon echo first, along with the dots, they were hard to operate, and it cost more to get other programs for it. ordered the google home (for my bed ridden husband) it was wonderful easy to set up and get started, been adding features daily. he loves it and it is very easy to operate and interact with. it understands him, where echo did not. love it. has brightened his day. i even bought 2 more, one for my bedroom and another for the kitchen."
388,14,"i knew i wanted it,  i did not think i needed it but i use it a lot more than i expected to. the only thing i thought i could do that it can not yet is wright to my calenda. it reads appointment well but you can not wright now. i use the alarms in it and timers, the my day feature and music. also i just remembered i cannot set reminders only read what you set on your phone or computer. you can set alarms, timers and add things to your shopping list."
389,14,"the home speaker works well and has enough volume to fill a good sized room.  best of all, it is connected to a better search engine and understands more natural speech than the amazon echo, in my experience (i do also have an echo, and it is also very good).  i do not believe though that this device is worth $130.  if it was $100 or less, i would give it 5 stars.  at $50 the echo dot is a much better deal, but i personally prefer the google home."
390,14,"i chose the google home over alexa because of the supposed ""depth of knowledge"" when compared with alexa and the fact that alexa is just an ordering device for all things amazon. my google is still learning and i would have to say that it is in the ""infancy stage of knowledge and ability"". i have no doubt that its capacity will be expanded to match or surpass gh, and right out of the box it is fun to play with, but, i want more!"
391,14,"good, entry level device. works seamlessly with my wi-fi. it takes a little time and practice to know what it can and cannot do.  i am looking forward to more updates to the device to make it more useful.  very handy for all types of music and can answer most elementary questions. i will be glad when it can be more personalized with added memory pertaining to the primary user to make it more adaptable. over-all very good product."
392,0,"we were so happy to see our grandkids enjoy playing with this tonight.we introduced it to the family by asking it to say ""grace"" for our xmas eve meal, and so it did.  the rest of the meal they intermittenently asked various questions , testing it is intelligence and capabilities. they will be surprised when they come over tomorrow to open their gifts  and realize they too have a ""google home""  just like grampa is ."
393,14,"google home is highly responsive and has the promise to be an extremely entertaining and valuable home accessory.   however because it is so new, it lacks the depth of amazon echo is connections, networks and functionality.  on the plus side the google home has been deeply discounted lately making it compelling to try.  i am sure with google is depth, it will eventually be as complete if not more complete than amazon is offering."
394,14,"this little gadget is an awesome addition to your home.  if you use it for nothing more than playing music it is a good value at $130, but it is so much more!  ""ok google, tell me about my day"" gives you a complete rundown of everything you need to know.  it is like having everything right at your fingertips.  it is even motivated me to buy home-control devices!"
395,14,needs improvement. $129 is too expensive for something that cannot compare to amazon
396,14,"i have had google home for about one month. it has been fun. it will play music, tell jokes, make my shopping list, and answer most of my general knowledge questions.
my grandson likes the quiz games.  i choose google over alexa because google gave me better, more complete answers to my questions. however, if you want a good variety of free music, alexa is better."
397,0,"got this for my internet-deprived 80 yo dad.  he loves it. best christmas present at the party, entertaining many. i do have privacy concerns, but it truly is an amazing little gadget with substantial untapped potential for home automation. also relatively inexpensive compared to echo (and better looking imho). it seems to work much better than the google voice app on my cell phone too."
398,14,"bought this for my father so he could avoid using any sort of computer. he is had a few strokes and most of his memories (movies, music) go back to the 40s and 50s. ironically, i received one from my stepchildren.  there are many questions it can not help me with, while using a computer gets many more answers. hopefully it is learning my habits and will improve."
399,14,this is the best intelligent speaker ever built till date. google does it again with great products as always. this speaker is a work of great beauty and precision. the high and low of the speaker are excellent! superb sound capacity and flawless design. echo with alexa is skill and intelligence and speaker is nowhere near this beauty.
400,14,"bought and tried out but it is so far behind amazon echo, it has a long way to go to catch up. it barely recognizes commands and has only three home smart devices it can connect to and the music library is horrible. echo blows this out of the water and i just could not see keeping this until it could surpass echo. save yourself some money and just go with amazon. this device is a joke!"
401,14,"great christmas gift for my husband who has everything! plays music, works with our chromecast, plays games, and so much more. we have had lots of fun with the google home. it is also helpful when cooking with ability to set individual timers for different foods while being hands free. you do have to learn the language to speak to it. once you do that it is breeze to use."
402,14,"o ver $100. 90% of questions are answered with""i am sorry but i do not know how to answer that yet"".  mostly used to play christmas music!"
403,14,"this thing is far better the amazon echo. it has more features and does more then just buy stuff.

i use it for music, questions that amazon echo can not answer, cutting stuff on like lights and controlling  thermostat.

it also works with logitech harmony elite. the best but expensive remote control with hub.

 and i can hear you from  another room whispering ok google or hey google."
404,14,when i got this i needed a smart phone to set it up. i do not have a smart phone. when i ordered it you did not say anything about needing a smart phone. i was going to take it back when a friend came over and set it up for me.  now i like it.
405,14,"there were many times google would say ""i am sorry, i do not know how to do that"" for simple requests. sometimes she would not know the answer and siri would. she would create a shopping list for you, but when asked to tell you what was on it, she would struggle the first few times. maybe on the 4th ask, she would get it right. too frustrating! she went back to walmart after a week!"
406,14,it does do much but play music and does not understand too much
407,14,"the google home by self is really awesome. however if you really want to see just how cool it is at the google chrome cast and the phillip smart hue lights, and the google home becomes an entirely new experience. i am definitely loving it if you are not sure about it pick one up try it out for a week if you do not like it then take it back but i sincerely doubt it will be going back."
408,0,"bought the google home for my daughter for christmas...more than satisfied with the google home!!!!  i think everyone should have one love it!! i was incredibly impressed with walmart is ""store pick""...order it on line..paid for it on line.. received an email and text that it was ready to be picked up the next day!!!!   awesome customer service!!!!!"
409,14,"enjoyed in the kitchen over the holidays.  great to ask random family questions, get cooking advice, and music on voice demand.  now in kids room and being enjoyed as alarm clock, weather, music, and school calendar.

not at the all knowing computer level we see in the sci-fi movies but a great start that i expect to expand over the next years."
410,14,"we are enjoying this device, the sound quality is sufficient, it has some basic features that are useful, but it is still early in development, and could use things like a to-do list, and multiple accounts.  we are happy with the purchase, because we expect continuous development from google, but for now it is just a very expensive radio, with a lackluster shopping list."
411,0,i really like this item. it is great for getting answers to questions. not interested in automation of home. very easy to set up using a free program. the sound quality is good being a little base. it is a very good price compared to amazon echo. would not hesitate to buy another one.
412,14,"i think this is overrated.  you have to have specific questions to ask google.,  it is good for the weather forcast and some other things....but it does not give feed back on a lot of questions.....it is fun though."
413,14,"i can not tell you how many times my hands have been covered in flour or something for cooking and i cant touch a timer, this makes it easy to say ok google set a timer, or play some music or really anything. and i love the elegant design, it fits in much better than amazon alexa."
414,14,i am not sure this rating is fair. i gave this to my blind dad thinking he would have all the answers just by asking. so far it cannot answer many seemingly simple questions. it does well on weather and news and playing music. i am not sure it is set up correctly  because a google search on the computer can find the answers.
415,14,"it is in the early stages so do not expect too much but it does a lot from weather, traffic, turning on/off lights (requires smart light/hub) turns shows on tv (requires chromecast) but even at it is basic functions the timer is very useful less things are getting burnt these days."
416,0,this was so easy to set up and get started. it has what we wanted and has yet to be stumped on a question. voice activation has a great reach. so far it has been fun and educational. bought it during the discount and has been worth it. went between this and an echo. most things i have is google oriented and went with this.
417,0,this product is very responsive to voice commands providing relevant information just when it is needed. google home has a high-quality speaker that delivers clear sound at all volumes. google home is both information utility and 'toy.'  it was easy to setup. we had it out of the box and working in less than ten minutes.
418,14,"i had already bought an echo, but but it is terrible at answering general knowledge questions.  google home is much better.at that, but cannot pair with my bluetooth home theater for music."
419,14,"but not enough things to do with it so far.  i am using it with ifttt to control my wemo and for that it is good.  it also answers more questions than the nearest competitor and can interpret spoken language better. google needs to catch up to the other lady, a........a in applications though."
420,0,"unfortunately,  it responds with alot of ""i am sorry, i can not help you with that yet"".  got it to impress my husband who still lives in the stone ages, fail!"
421,14,"i use the gh to make internet inquiries, keep my calendar, and am connected to the nest thermostat. i have not moved to the remote lights yet. still need more product applications, like security, tv, and appliances."
422,14,the product itself looks good and would be fun to use but you need to have it connected to your wifi in order for it to work.  we were unable to connect to the comcast router so it is going back.   it is disappointing but there is no immediate answers as to what the problem is.
423,14,"i own the alexia and 3 dots, but i thought i would give google a try.
i should have waited until google actually supports anything worth while. 
yes using ifttt you can make google work with some devices, but out of the box it is pretty lame.
no native support for wink hubs or harmony hubs means i will be sticking with my alexia for now."
424,14,when i bought this i realized it was new and did not have as much to offer as amazon echo but i figured that would quickly change. what i did not expect was that the home does not hear my voice well. with volume set at six  i can stand close and scream and not be heard. i returned home and bought and echo.
425,0,really do like this it was a great thing to buy for my husband who has dementia he can find out what day date and weather in on question
426,14,"i decided to get this google home after i had the amazon echo.  there is a lot of overlap in uses for these two, but only the google device allows you to utilize all the cool lookup power of google.  if you enjoy having google voice recognition on your phone, you will love having this in your home."
427,14,"have not had so much technological fun in a long time. google home has become a member of the family -- way smarter than my wife and me. has answers most of the time, but, when no answer almost always indicates the she is working on it. ""yet"" is a big word. i have been spreading the word among friends and family. lots of takers...."
428,14,"we are very happy with our google home.  it is easy to set up and you can start using it right away.  we especially like the ""add to shopping list"" feature which downloads a list to your phone.  i did not know much about it when i ordered but i am glad i did.  the in-store pick up at walmart was fabulous!"
429,0,"this is an awesome product, bought for my husband for christmas and he uses all the time and my son(7) loves it, when he does not know how to pronounce a world when reading he spells it to google and she tells him the word and definition. my daughter(4) loves to ask google to tell her jokes!"
430,14,"we have an echo dot from amazon but we are a google family.  this device plays our music, reads our books to us, turns our lights on and off and more.  we are still learning all that google home can do for us and so far, it is a very convenient tool to have in the house."
431,0,"the product works just as expected. we are thrilled with it. most importantly, although i am not a frequent shopper of walmart, this item was out of stock and it arrived sooner than expected for pick up. the woman at the pick up counter was friendly and helpful. well done walmart."
432,0,"bought the google home for my husband.  he just loves it, was easy to set up and can get information on just about everything.  he loves the music feature and the news and weather of the day, as well as all other things you can ask it. great product for the money."
433,0,i was amazed at how easy it was to set up. i was also surprised at how much even my younger grandkids enjoyed it. it very accurately understands your requests. the music selection is nice even if you do not sign up for the subscription service. i bought ten of these as presents and everyone is really enjoying them.
434,0,"very easy to set up.  lots of fun and also convenient when having a disgreement about something.  google home will solve it by just asking the question about the disagreement and she has the answer.  as for walmart, received the product extremely fast and exactly what was ordered."
435,14,this product is awesome! it is user friendly and easy to use!...it does take some work from you...creating playlists...connecting to smart devices...but we have already had hours of fun just asking it questions!...great tech addition to any household!...two thumbs up great family fun!
436,14,"this is a fun little creature! i get a kick out of asking certain questions and am impressed at how fast she can answer. apparently there are quite a few actions she can not give info on at this time. i am guessing as time goes on, there will be more and more added to improve things."
437,14,"some times its not responding, it hears me when i called it, and the light respond but it will shut off without responding even not saying that it did not understand me.
cannot recognize or gives the full supports in my region (united arab emirates), it wont play music in my region."
438,0,i really love this google home item. i love it so much i had bought my husband one for christmas. and it was the best thing going i thought so we purchased another one on line before everyone gets hip and they are hard to find. we love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
439,0,"still learning how to communicate, but it works great for most things we have tried. example, she could not fathom the howard hugs connection to the spruce goose and date of it is first flight. google had the info, but she could not get it. may have been semantics issue."
440,0,"we were able to get the google home from walmart when it was not available at other stores.  this allowed us to get our son the perfect christmas gift.  he loves technology and as google home gets more advanced he will be able to do new things  daily.

thank you!"
441,14,i love google and i love the idea of this but there is a hardware issue that has to be worked out before you buy. the mic stops working within days or a week. look online. search for google home mic static. thousands of people are having to return their units.
442,14,"excellent and practical!   great for the hard to gift person -- or if you have kids and/or for seniors.  its like opening a browser and searching google, but instead of reading your search, she verbally responds to your request.    cool gadget!  highly recommend!"
443,0,this one is for my living room. i have already one in my kitchen. together with chromecast audio the google home is an awesome multiroom sound system. sold my sonos system and havent looked back since. great for home automation aswell. im very happy about my purchase.
444,0,"loving google home and goggle cast (tv).  always turned on at home for any music we requested, google knows and information be it fun or informative google knows!!

great gift for the both of us.

ofie and sev"
445,14,"this has prevented many arguments in our house.  my husband and i use to banter back and forth about different facts.  now, we just ask google. if you are married or if you have children,get it! it will stop a lot of arguments and bring peace to your home."
446,14,"the commerials show that you can do all kinds of things with the google home. but they do not tell you , you must spend hundreds more to get them to do these things. i was very disapionted. and two of my friends took theirs back."
447,0,i have enjoyed the product and it has saved me a lot of time. great price and delivered promptly!
448,14,"has potential but not quite there yet.  the device can certainly benefit  of more smarts.  i want to be able to tell google home to play my music on my bose soundtouch in a specific room (living room, bedroom or wherever).  it can not even tell me what movies are playing near me."
449,0,having a lot of fun and organizing our hectic lives with our google home !!!   she learns and teaches us new things everyday !!!   looking forward to learning with her and cannot wait until she integrates more with google systems and more !!!
450,14,i originally purchased alexia and was not happy. she cant do what google home can. i sent her back and purchased google home and could not be happier.
451,14,"i have not learn a lot so far and i do not have a smart house, but it has been very helpful. spelling words for me, telling me the temperature, playing games with it and talking back and forth and some times she will answer. fun!"
452,0,"i purchased this devise for my husband and son for christmas. i was not sure how they would like it. they are both very ""techie"" and i was a bit hesitant buying something like this for them. they both just loved it. i recommend this product."
453,14,"the google home is great.  i am glad they finally came out with a competitor for the amazon echo.  once google allows more third-party integration, the google home will be much better than the echo.  as it stands, the echo has more native integration with smart devices."
454,14,very convenient voice recognition tool that helps me cast netflix services and music directly from the unit. would not trade it for any other device on the market.
455,14,"i got this after i got frustrated by alexa is inability to answer simple ""google"" questions. 

its still missing some abilities but should get better with future updates. 

they need to enable the ability to change the ""ok google"" trigger term to something shorter and easier."
456,0,"bought this as christmas present for the family. like that it is white, instead of black like echo. 
so easy to play music by just requesting it. the speakers are high quality.  
not a necessity but a fun easy addition to your life!"
457,14,so much fun! awesome technology. surprisingly small.
458,14,"from the moment we plugged it in, the fun began. i actually felt sorry for ms.google...from questions about everything and listening to all types of music, it is a wonder she did not shut down.
i would recommend this to everyone."
459,14,"google home as an assistant and a speaker is as good as amazon echo but cuz echo is way earlier than google home they have devoloped much more skills and support 
where the google home is released more than ten months now there no new skills or support for it"
460,0,we just got this little gadget for christmas.  it was very easy to set up and the sound that comes out of it is amazing!! we love our music and this really delivers great sound. ask it anything - it is totally awesome! we love it!
461,14,"device works great. setup was pretty straight forward.
since google is sort of new to smart things i had to do some trial and error to get my first devices (lights) to work. 
i am sure as google goes forward they will expand to become leaders in the smart world!"
462,0,i love my google home
463,0,i purchased this as a gift to my son and his family. they rave about this product . they absolutely love it. my grandchildren can not wait to get back to school so they can put google home to the test with homework assignments.
464,14,it is completely unnecessary but a fun little thing to have around. i am finding uses for it and will add accessories to control lights and tv. i would buy it again.
465,0,"got this at a black friday low price. simple to set up, extremely reactive, so far the whole family is having fun with it, and we are hoping google comes out with a line of integrated accessories (wall / light plugs etc), n the future."
466,14,"love it. the only thing i would
like to see is it make a call or text someone.. but i am sure it will come later since this is new and they will see what people need and want. but i do love it and use it everyday..."
467,0,"it is a lot of fun and you can obtain a lot of info, useful & fun!!!! our grandkids just 
love it, and you can not believe the questions they ask!  (it also teaches us about 
our grandkids!)"
468,0,"i like this product it is really good and the speakers are great, will use it a lot for music, and getting information we need,"
469,14,"wow, ask it a question and it gives you an answer. ask for a specific song or best of a decade and it is done. it is like having a best friend always in the house, only you really do not have to entertain."
470,14,i bought the google home for my wife for xmas. it has worked great so far. i believe once more features get added to the system it will get even better. i would definitely recommend this to anyone. especially for the price.
471,0,excellent. responds very well. google says they will be updating their database on this device.
472,14,a good starting place to get your google on. fun to do voice searches and have only just begun to integrate into home automation systems. it will be a lot easier to just say turn off the lights rather than to find my phone or tablet to do the same.
473,0,"great product, great sound, great automation."
474,14,i did a lot of research before deciding to by the google home.    it is just as good as all the reviews that i read on it.  it is easy to set up and simple to use.  i would recommend this to anyone of any age.
475,0,bought this as a birthday gift for my so in-law.  he loves it and do my grandchildren.  definitely worth the money
476,0,"the recipient had never seen or heard of this product, or other products like it.  therefore she was really excited once she set it up and started using it.   it definitely was a hit!"
477,0,google home works terrific!
478,0,i love it
479,14,"you need a android device or smart phone to activate.  i only have a kindle fire which does not support google apps. and yes, not everyone in the world has a cell phone. will have to  return as it was a gift for my son."
480,14,"my dad is blind and has been using the amazon echo for over a year and found the search lacking.

the google home really excels in voice search.  and it provides detailed voice answers.  overall he says the google home is his top pick."
481,14,i love this speaker nice and loud l. ypu habe to talk to it for a while so it can answer your question appropriately.  it does not do well woth children voices.
482,14,"i stream music to my sound bar in my tv now more than i ever did. it is not perfect, but does an excellent job at abating l answering random questions. it is alot of fun!"
483,14,this google home is awesome!  when you play music it has enough bass to sound great. you can play trivia and mad lips and you can ask it pretty much anything. you will never want to be without your google assistant
484,14,worked great for a few days. then for no apparent reason it would not play music when requested or would only play one song or two then stop. very dissatisfied with this product. do not buy.
485,14,"it is my right arm, any music i want plus"
486,14,"for example, google home only reads off one calendar and google keep is not able to be used yet. these need to be implemented to be as effective as possible."
487,0,"had it for a week and think it is great. can not figure out how to get it to play podcasts but besides that we love asking it for daily news, play music and other fun things!"
488,0,love my google home.  it has brought music back to our lives.  we love the dj aspect.  attached to blue tooth speakers by google chromocast audio.  the entire house rocks.
489,0,works great
490,14,works as advertised. answers more questions than other smart home devices. can control other chromecast.com devices. great product!
491,0,my wife loves this
492,14,"voice control of the house is the next big thing, google has done a pretty good job with this. it does not quite do all the things the amazon one does just yet but if you use ifttt you can do a lot."
493,0,my husband is enjoying all of his favorite music by simply asking for it! the speakers are so clear! throw any question at goigleand it is answered right away! love it!!!!!
494,14,"just like the ok google function in my android phone, google phone answers questions, plays music on request, and with adjuncts, can control home appliances, lights, etc. fun toy to have and interact with."
495,14,"great speaker. some voice commands do not work. cannot make to do list, add to calendar, or message people. chromecast voice commands are difficut. wish did not have to say okay google for every request"
496,14,read every review i could find before buying.  just waiting for the day when i can add items on my shopping list directly to walmart grocery.  that would make me really happy!  very satisfied.
497,14,love this for background music and the occasional question. has some glitches in connecting to pandora some times but all in all cool
498,14,"i expected something great, the google home is what i am expecting for this kind of item. now i need to buy more smart things (bulbs, switches, keyless deadbolt ...) to use it at 100%."
499,14,no problem with setting it up. it has to have an access to internet and that is the only  thing required from a user. i like it very much and the only thing could be  added text messaging capability.
500,14,"it has been fun getting to know how to use google home. it does have some limitations; however, i believe google will rectify these items over time."
501,0,i bought the google home for my wife for christmas and she absolutely loves it. it is amazing the amount of information you can get by simply saying ok google.
502,14,".connected to my nest, chromecast, philips hue and of course netflix and youtube red.. can not complain. my 7 yr old daughter enjoy playing trivia and story creation.."
503,0,purchased this as a xmas gift. my son in law requested this and they love. i also purchased a google gift card for them so they have access to more apps.
504,0,"i was surprised at how much google home knows.  my grand kids spend hours with it asking for music and jokes. 
btw: the jokes are kinda corny,"
505,0,"its awsome my husband has ordered more for our room upstairs my mother in law was at aww with it, know she wants one please please order great great product"
506,14,it only syncs to one calendar apparently but hopefully an upgrade will occur soon so do not have to buy new product but the rest ion the google home is great!!
507,14,this is amazing! google home can hear you from a distance. only bad thing is that it is hard to connect to other devices if they are not also new; like a tv.
508,14,"just for the music alone it is worth it.  i was able to play music i have not heard in years.
it has access to so much information.  it is a regular encyclopedia.  i would like one in every room."
509,14,i wish it was compatible with my iris smart hub...  it is wired all through my house. but it is a good thing to have if your a googler like myself.
510,0,this thing is so much fun and endless possibilities.  the sound is just amazing. great value for the money
511,0,purchased for a gift and enjoyed watching grandkid is experience with the product.
512,14,"functionality is limited - she often ""does not know how to help with a that yet"""
513,14,this is a good speaker with decent sound qualities that is connected to your wi-fi. the added bonus is that as updates continue it will become functional with the other services
514,14,this does not measure up to amazon is alexa-based products yet.  the music selection is very limited and usually results in a mix that may contain one or 2 songs from the requested artist.
515,14,still learning how to use it but it has been great to ask to hear something and hear it without searching and clicking. it is our new favorite toy.
516,0,"great for me and my 84 year old mom! she can ask for sums,  etc.,  so she will not have to use arthritic fingers on a calculator!   love requesting facts!"
517,14,"love google home! easy to set up and use. wish i could link it to more than 1 google account, but that would not keep me from buying it."
518,0,i really love it! i did not know that google home came with 6 free months of youtube red ! they really plugged it .
519,14,"good price.  very good gift.  google still needs to make it provide more info, but it is almost just as good as the amazon echo."
520,14,overall helpful but a lot of google.com not available on home when we ask simple questions. hope google corrects this
521,0,i bought this for my dad for christmas and he claims it is the best gift he ever got. he loves it! very user friendly and fun!
522,0,"easy set-up,  good sound.  first practical use was asking it for a ham glaze recipe.  it did not hesitate a bit.  easily synced to google calendar."
523,14,"will not play music. google says it is playing music from pandora and nothing plays. 
other than that we have enjoyed it so far."
524,14,"while we enjoyed the product at first, it stopped worked after day 2. still trying to get it replaced. undetermined review."
525,0,"so far we love our googlehome.  she gives us the news, weather, scores, random trivia questions, adjusts our smart lights when we ask her, she is the total package!"
526,14,"performed as expected and advertised. does not know or have all the answers, but is entertaining.  i wish we would have tried it sooner."
527,14,"some may think this is just another must have for grown ups, but i love it. it has some learning to do, it will not take long if u know google."
528,14,when asking questions i am surprised how fast this thing is.  do not have any devices connected to it yet. work in progress.
529,0,great product
530,14,does everything i expected from it.
531,0,"quick easy pickup when ordering online. love the google home! i am going to get one for the home, that one was a gift."
532,0,i ordered this item online for my son and had it shipped to his home.  it arrived ahead of schedule and he loves it.
533,14,"fun product to have to utilize all ""google"" options as well as to listen to music!  still has some quirks to work out re calendar status hence only 4 instead of 5 stars."
534,0,love love google home!!  she gives us the morning weather and top news!!! my kids love to ask her math questions!!!
535,14,i wish it did a few more things. knowing google more will come in time. i am still learning to speak so it understands me
536,0,recommend.  it is a little pricy but my daughter is happy with it.  super easy to purchase on line and pick up in store.
537,14,"wow, what fun you can have with the google home.  great music and the sound out of the little box is great.  go get one......"
538,14,very useful. hey google that is always on and available.
539,0,so far ...great....we love them.  they were sent to us packaged perfectly! thank you ??

541,0,it works great! love it! i bought it for a friend for christmas and now i am going to get one for myself!!!
542,0,"very easy to use, a lot of people we know have or want one, wife & grandkids love it"
543,14,waste of money. i  have an app on my ipad that does the same thing for less money.
544,14,little smarter than alexa as far as information goes there is not a whole lot more to say than   it is very good when you need information
545,0,the abilities of this little device are endless!  best investment for my retired parents. they love it!!
546,0,a gift for my son.  he loves it.
547,14,"reason for a 4 and not a 5 rating.  google home is great, it is still in the learning stage.

i bought 3  for my family.

google home is fun and entertaining."
548,14,"i love it, the sound is clear and loud.  i also love the design, blends in with my decor."
549,0,item works well as expected.
550,14,the set up for this device is not compatible with kindle fire.  returned it because of this situation.
551,14,i love it and i know it will only get better as google start to update it.
552,0,i gave this to my dad for christmas. he absolutely loves it and so does all his friends that come over.
553,0,google home is very easy to set up. fun but helpful technology that is a great addition to the home.
554,14,only had a few week is not sure if you have to pay for music yet. as far as questions we have asked excellent
555,14,it was very easy to set up and it is so convenient. it is always ready to go and can answer any question.

562,14,"if you are already part of the google ecosystem, then this is a great addition. it is capable now, and getting better with every update."
563,14,"we use it to set alarms for reminders to take medicine, etc."
564,14,everyone uses it for music or weather updates or even to tell a joke.
