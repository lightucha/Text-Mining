0,Google making hardware is a beautiful thing.,"Amazing product. The accuracy recognizing what I say is extremely good. Been using it mostly for news and music in the morning, and to impress friends when they come. Want to set up some iot lights that I can use voice control on but they're too expensive at the moment. If you have a chrome cast you'll never have to search for videos again because you can just find them with your voice and it integrates flawlessly. The speaker is surprisingly very robust. 

Only negative for me is having to say ""hey Google"" every time. It's not as smooth as saying a name like Alexa.",11/20/2016,(957),(412)
1,Google Home is a great product for the family,"I¡¯ve had my Google Home for about 3 weeks and have been very happy with it.  Setup was a breeze and could have been done by anybody.

// Pros / Difference from Echo:
- #1 major difference. Google Home can handle different grammatical structures and syntax for the same question.  Simple example: What is the capital of Norway? = Which city is the capital of Norway? = What is the Norwegian capital?  I find this really good for family and friends because -- unlike with Alexa / Echo -- we don¡¯t have to learn how to exactly verbalize every ¡°skill¡±.  Google Home allows us to speak naturally without us having to learn its own language.
- The above ability combined with Google Home¡¯s awareness of context helps it with some complicated questions like: Me: OK Google. What is that song from the Lion King?  > Google Home: The songs are Circle of Life and ¡¦ > Me: OK Google. Play it please > Google Home: Sure. Playing Circle of Life. = Wow. Note that I didn¡¯t even mention the song.
- #2 major difference is multi-room audio!!  I¡¯ve got two Google Home devices and two Chromecast Audio devices ($35 each) in my home, and I labeled the group as ¡°Entire Home¡±.  So I can say: OK Google.  Play Arianna Grande in Entire Home.  Echo is unable to do this (yet?).
- The ¡°Good morning¡± / ¡°My day¡± feature is really neat on Google Home. It tells me in one pass about the weather, traffic to work, my appointments, and rounds up with news from my favorite sources.
- Works flawlessly with Chromecast devices.  Example: OK Google. Play a funny cat video from YouTube on the Living Room Chromecast > Then Google plays it on Chromecast, which triggers my living room TV to show the video
- There are some customizable bases that are better suited to your home decor.  However, these are a little pricey for fabric and metal.  Nonetheless, Google Home is very soft and unassuming in its design whereas  Echo feels very industrial to me personally.

// Pros / Similarities with Amazon Echo: 
- The far-field mics work well and can pick up voices from across the room without having to yell.
- The speaker quality is very good.
- Works well with Google Play Music, Spotify, YouTube, etc.  But Google Home doesn¡¯t work with Amazon Music (yet?).
- Connected Home - Works well with Philips Hue lightbulbs and Nest Thermostat.  I haven¡¯t tested out other brands like LifX, Wemo, etc.  I do think Echo has more connected home applications because it¡¯s been in the market longer, but I don¡¯t use those other services at this time.
- Set reminders, timers, get recipes, get directions, call an Uber
- There are lots of IFTTT (third party app -- try it out!) routines that can be built.
- The Google Home app is very easy to use.

// Minor Cons
- You do have to say ¡°OK Google¡± to prompt the device.  However, this is no different than saying ¡°Alexa¡± for Echo.  The Pro I seen in this is related to privacy -- I don¡¯t want the device to respond to anything my family is talking about unless we specifically want to interact with it.
- Only the top of the Google Home device has a light indicator to show when it¡¯s listening.  So if you¡¯ve got this on your kitchen counter and you¡¯re seated on your couch (at a lower height), you may not see the lights.  Echo overcomes this with the light ring around the device.
- The Google Home device can¡¯t be used as a speakerphone or be used to make phone calls. 
- Saying OK Google also triggers my phone.  I¡¯d like the ability to choose the device with which I want to interact.

// Major Cons:
- There can only be one user profile! So I can get a run down of my day, but my girlfriend can¡¯t get hers; we can only hear my services but not hers.  To be fair, this isn¡¯t that different from Echo, but it is a little annoying.  This seems like the next step for both Google and Amazon.

Overall, I think Google Home is an excellent product, and I look forward to seeing more services being made available.",11/26/2016,(1325),(322)
2,The Google Home Makes Life More Convenient,"The Google Home is a well built voice activated speaker that sounds pretty good and is useful for many things, specifically the Google Home is quite useful for setting alarms and timers, and I have been getting up in the morning more consistently than I had been before I received my Google Home.
The Google Home is able to play at volume levels that are plenty sufficient for most situations. 
If you choose to buy a Google home, after connecting it to your internet connection, then it is best to download the Google Home app for Android or Apple, then locate and optimize all the settings to get the best experience using the Google Home. In the settings there is a setting called Accessibility, it allows you to turn on the option to play an audible sound, which indicates when you should speak your verbal request. This means that after you say OK GOOGLE, you will then hear an audible beep, so you will know exactly when to speak your request, without this Accessibility sound option turned on, it is necessary to be looking at the Google Home device when saying OK GOOGLE, so that you can see the lights on the top of the Google Home light up, of which the lights indicates that you should then speak your request. It is basically easier to say OK GOOGLE and hear an audible beep indicating when to speak your request, than it is to say OK GOOGLE and have to be looking at the device to see the visual indicator to know when to speak your request.
The Google Home app has the option to add your home address, which is necessary for the Google Assistant to provide your weather requests, as the Google Home needs to know the location of the weather that you are desiring.
The Google Home app allows you to set a desired music playback source, and also allows you to create a list of your desired news sources, allowing you to customize the news that you can hear playing through the Google Home.
Newer versions of the Android operating system have the built in options of allowing the Google Assistant to be always listening, so that you can say OK GOOGLE, and then you can make a verbal request, the same way that the Google Home does, but using the Google Home device is a much better experience. The two microphones on the Google Home pick up your voice noticeably better than the microphone on a smart phone.
The Google Chrome web browser has apps and extensions that can be installed, which add interactivity with your Google Home device. Do a Google search for Chrome Web Store, and it will bring up the website where you can search for and install the available Google Apps and Extensions.
The Google Keep app for Google Chrome, allows you to create a shopping list that can be used with the Google Home Assistant, just create a shopping list in the Google Keep app, then ask the Google Home Assistant: What is my shopping list, then the Assistant will verbally remind you of all the things on your shopping list.
The Google Keep app can be downloaded for Android or Apple and can be installed on your smart phone, allowing you to create shopping lists the same way.
The Google Calendar extension for Google Chrome, allows you to quickly add calendar entries, then you can ask the Google Home Assistant: What is on my calendar, and the Assistant will verbally remind you of your calendar events.
The Google Cast extension for Google Chrome, allows you to see which song Pandora is playing, this extension allows you to pause music playback and also adjust the volume level, all of this from the Google Chrome browser.
Below is a list of verbal requests that the Google Home can be used for:
What time is it
Set an alarm for 7 am, Set a timer for 30 minutes (Multiple timers and alarms can be set)
Stop alarm, Stop timer, Stop all timers, Stop all alarms
What is today¡¯s weather (Your local weather will be read if your address has been set)
What is the weather in Ventura, California (Any city and state can be requested)
What is the humidity (Your local humidity will be read if your address has been set)
Is Wal-Mart open, Is Best Buy open, Is Jack in the box open, etc..
What is on my calendar (Calendar events must be added first in Google Calendar)
Add orange juice to my shopping list, Add bananas to my shopping list, etc..
What is my shopping list
Play music, Pause music (Music will play from your chosen default music source)
Play Google Play music (Use this if Pandora is default music source)
Play Pandora music (Use this if Google Play Music is default music source)
Play news, Pause news (News will play from your chosen list of news sources)
Turn up the volume, Turn down the volume
Volume level 4, Volume level 6, Volume level 3, etc.. (Volume levels 1 - 10)
What is the volume
The Google Home voice activated smart speaker, allows adding Philips Hue lighting control, it is necessary to synchronize the Google Home device with the Philips Hue bridge, this synchronizing is done in the settings of the Google Home app on an Android or Apple device, once this is setup, all of the following can be said to control Philips Hue lighting. 
Turn lights on 10 percent, Turn lights on 50 percent, Turn lights light blue (Daylight), Turn lights white (Warm white), Turn lights red (Great for movie lighting, or night lights), Dim lights, Turn lights on 100 percent, Turn lights off.
The Google Home has a really nice power supply, which has a silicone strap that wraps around the cord. A quality power supply always adds to making an electronic device have a luxury feel to it.
My overall opinion of the Google Home Assistant, is that owning and using the Google Home has made life more convenient.",11/6/2016,(932),(296)
3,Google Home is fun,I ordered this because I had seen it advertised and thought it would be fun and could be helpful too!  I have a lot to learn yet but I have used it for music and playing games! You can ask it anything of course! This is the future and it is already here in my house! I think everyone should have a Google Home.!,12/15/2016,(428),(264)
4,This thing is pretty cool,"It's pretty much like having the power of the internet, without having to type. You just ask...",11/5/2016,(473),(258)
5,Google Home VERSUS Amazon's Echo!,"I think that Amazon's ECHO (Alexa) need a bit of competition; however, Alexa is leaving the rest of them behind. Until Google ""catch up"" with as many APPS as Amazon & partners are offering I'm afraid ""Google Home"" is going to be left behind.
Amazon's ECHO (Alexa) debued a few years ago...and already is in a CLASS by itself.
Alexa can control residential lights, thermostats, lock & unlock doors to the residence, set burgular alarm, turn on the (water) irrigation sprinklers, turn your vehicle on (get it all warmed up for you during cold harsh weather...defrost the windows), she will let you know if you are low on fuel, oil and break fluid! She can even order pizza or a uber ride for you! lol 
She can place orders on Amazon for you (especially repeat orders such as computer essentilas-like printer ink. She can also make a ""TO DO"" list for you, a grocery list, a events calendar, etc. Alexa can help children with homework, she reads books  and play numereous mind games & music. She has a GREAT, VAST RESOURCE that she utilizes. She GROWS every day; therefore, she is ALWAYS up on current events & data!!!
She gives the forecast for the day ""or"" an entire week. She's quite accurate with the weather (haven't made a mistake with me yet)! ;-D She can give you transportation schedules for ""local"" buses, BART, etc. Alexa can book entertainment venues for you (such as StubHub, etc.), reserve the tickets, etc. let you know what's going on in entertainment industry or whats showing at the theater/cinema. She also knows what is happening in your territory-specials events, galas, plays, shows, tours, festivals, art exhibits, musicals, ballet, etc. She also keep you ""updated"" with sports, current & past events. She's current with political & world NEWS. She has an APP that allows her to recite requested recipes, etc. (This APP is growing daily). She is also an alarm, and has a ""reminder"" timer! You'll never be LATE for events, picking up the kiddies from soccer practice AND you'll never burn that cake again! :-D
Yeah, ALEXA is WOWESOME. 

Google has a lot to catch up to! ;-D

 If they get the software engineers and people that just love making APPS, then ""Google Home"" will give Amazon Alexa (ECHO) a challenge. I'm sure both products utilize Far-Field VOICE RECOGNITION (this allow the units to accept voice commands from across the room). The speakers on ECHO are so superior. I can hardly believe the ""sound"" that comes from this 9-inch product.

Amazon has also released their ""portable"" version of ECHO, it's call ""ECHO TAP""...you tap the button on the front and she can do everything that the ""home stationed"" ECHO (ALEXA) can do. Amazon's ""ECHO TAP"" is great for people on the go! It is shorter and is protected with a sling (rubber) casing (cost extra, a lot of assorted colors to chose from, there is also a ""travel"" pouch available). Amazon's ECHO TAP utilizes (both) WI-FI & BLUETOOTH...it charges on a small disc (very cool looking). It last about 12 hrs. on a single charge. You can also ""charge"" with your USB port on laptaps, etc.
Additionally, Amazon has another fine product call, ""ECHO DOT""! 
Dot is smaller and can be hooked up to ""any"" sound/stereo system(TV ???)...and it will actually allow the system to receive VOICE COMMANDS. Pretty cool. It is 1/3 the size of Amazon's Echo, (which by the way is the perfect height & size...9-inches X 3-inches diameter, weigh about 37 oz., cost $179.99, but you can get it for $149. Amazon promotion period). AMAZON PRIME MEMBERS PURCHASE WAS ONLY $99.00 (But, I think that ended a couple of years ago). Amazon was offering ""ECHO"" for the special debut retail price to get the ""buzz"" going for their product at the time.
I'm not sure if GOOGLE HOME promoted their product in such a manner. But, I must say that the $129.00 PRICE POINT is not to bad, ""if"" GOOGLE HOME offers a zillion APPS to make it work like Amazon's ECHO (Alexa). Hum....

Amazon's ECHO, Amazon's TAP & Amazon's DOT is here to stay, i.e. until we get our ROBOTS & Jet Packs! ;-D Then they will become ancient...a thing of the past! LOL
*P.S. My family & I enjoy GOOGLE BRAND products, as well; therefore, we are looking forward to seeing what they do with  ""GOOGLE HOME"" in the future (2017-2018).
This is going to be a lot of FUN...let the race begin...so far Amazon's ECHO (ALEXA) is in the lead!",10/8/2016,(563),(790)
6,Google Home has a long way to catch up to Alexa.,"Google Home has a long way to catch up to Alexa. I have been using Alexa for a year now and also echo dot. I use Android on my phone so I thought I would give Google Home a try and if it worked out OK I would get rid of Alexa. Big mistake.
I'm glad for Walmart's return policy since I was very displeased with the Google product. I imagine in the future they will catch up to Alexa but no where near what Alexa can do now.
Another thing, the Alexa voice is so much more soothing to hear and listen to. I like the fact that I can send messages to my wife's phone or have Alexa call her without searching for my phone. Alexa tells me when I have a shipment coming from Amazon. I know Google Home is linked to Walmart.
Even when I set an alarm or timer, Google has a horrible ringing sound where as Alexa has a nice pleasant chime.
 I asked Google to do several things and it usually says sorry, I cannot do that yet. I will stick with my Alexa for now and wait a couple of years for Google to try and catch up. Until then, I took the Google Home and minis  back to the store.",12/6/2017,(77),(79)
7,Great Sound. Great Price. Go Google!!,"We love our Google Home and regularly use it at the dinner table, by placing piano music (with our toddler in mind).  It's been fun to watch our 16 month-old son learn about Google and he can even now say ""Google"".  We play music, turn on and off lights, and occasionally ask about weather and news.  The price at $99 is a steal and a lot less than we paid for.  I, personally, do not trust Amazon, and would shy away from using Alexa, since Amazon will heavily market to you, based on everything you do, and probably even the conversations you have in the background.  I feel much safer with Google Home than I do with Amazon.  At any rate, this is a really wonderful device and I hope that Google will partner with more companies as time goes by so that we will have more options to choose from.  The sound quality is great, by the way.",2/8/2018,(6),(3)
8,Don't know what I'd do without my Google Home,"I don't know what I did without my google home. This is great when cooking and you need to know how to convert measurements, just ask google! Google will help you with many tasks like that throughout the day. She'll even tell you jokes and more. You can almost have a conversation with her. Google has also helped my granddaughter to speak more clearly. When I first got Google Home, she didn't speak real clear, but she wanted Google to listen to her so she has come a long way with her speech. Google now listens and understands what she says (normally she is asking Google to play songs from the Frozen soundtrack). I'm buying her a Google mini for Christmas this year and am sure she'll be so excited to have her own Google. We play a lot of music on Google and it really sounds great. I've had Google Home for almost a year now and I still love it.",12/14/2017,(77),(60)
9,"Have had for a year now, LOVE","I have had Google Home for 1 year now. I liked it so much, I bought 2 more for my house, and gave them to my kids for Christmas this year.  You must have Wi-Fi and download the google Home app on your phone or Ipad.  Then all you do is plug it in and follow the directions and within 2 minutes it is hooked up. You can decide between a male or female voice. I use her so much, that when I am not at home, I am talking to her out loud and look crazy---LOL.  My favorite is to add things to the shopping list and it's always on your phone, listening to music, listening to sounds of nature at night to go to sleep to, she has an alarm, the kids play trivia games with her, I add things to my calendar and she will tell you what you have going on today. If I am cooking and forget something in a recipe or how hot the oven should be, she will find the recipe for me. My kids ask her to tell them a story and she reads books to them. She gives directions, weather, shops for you, turns Netflix on, wakes me up in the morning. To be honest, she feels like one of the family.  Since my work is all on Gmail and Google Calendar, Presentations, etc. This was the best option for us. The speaker is fantastic. I have both the mini and the large one. They are identical except larger one has better speaker.  
Just buy it.  It will be the most used item in your house.",12/27/2017,(18),(4)
10,Still waiting for some needed updates,"So far my Google Home (GH) experience has been a little of a let-down.  Only one Google account can be set up for now which means that shared calendar information is not handled by GH.  I share a calendar with my wife and hers is the primary calendar used for family planning.  GH does not list any events created on her calendar, only my primary calendar.  I also wish I could force it to recognize a certain route to my work.  It often provides travel times for alternate routes which are not good options for me. GH also only allows one shopping list so you cannot currently set up a shopping list for several different stores.  I do like how it integrates with Chromecast Audio.  You can set up speaker groups which is nice.  As for the GH itself, speaker quality is decent.  It lacks highs but handles bass sufficiently for the size of the unit.  For now it is just a novelty.  Without added updates, its value to me will be limited.",12/11/2016,(129),(91)
11,Amazon echo blows this away. I have both.,"I never seen Google deliver a product that wasn't great until now. I have Google for everything (including cell phone service on project Fi). I had high expectations for this device. The speaker quality and volume is only half of the echo. Both have a shopping list (this is the only thing Google slightly does better). The playing of music is where Google me their biggest corporate mistake EVER! And specifically playing random music (e.g. ""hey Google play...""). The echo will do this for free on most songs or of you have Amazon prime, almost any song. Google will not play any random songs (yes it back has Pandora), unless you pay for YouTube red. Yes YouTube is free on any device (including an Apple iPhone), but on the Google home, you have to pay!!! Maybe Google will change this on the future but for now Amazon is the big winner when it comes to these little in home devices.",12/29/2016,(95),(41)
12,"Very Good, with Only a Few Hiccups","I really like the Google Home. If you've thought about buying one, I would recommend it. (I've never tried the Alexa, but I've heard GH is better. The price is definitely better.)

There were a few hiccups, however. First, I had to buy a new wifi router because my old one was too old or inefficient; I'm not sure what the problem was, but I couldn't get the GH to connect to it. I bought a new Belkin (for about $60) and now everything works fine.

Second, the GH right now is more of a novelty than anything else. It answers questions (briefly) and plays music. It can do other things, but at the moment that's all I do with it. 

However I really like the technology, and I'm sure that in the future all appliances (TVs, computers, microwaves, etc.) will be able to tie into the GH. This will enable you to say, ""Hey Google, preheat the oven to 350."" At the moment such tech doesn't exist--or I don't have it--but I'm sure it will become more common (just like wifi is now almost universal). I know that it can do some things like that, but I don't have the tech set up to enable it to do so.",1/23/2017,(75),(41)
13,Google Home Assistant,"Fine example of AI (Artificial Intelligence).  Works well.   Simple Plug & Play installation.  Download and setup App to make personal preferences, location, etc.  Device has incredible sound and the ability to ""understand"" you.  The female voice is clear and pleasant.  It is in the learning stages so not everything you ask it yields a successful response.  You get its attention by saying ""OK Google"", ""Hey Google"" works too.    Works with Chromecast devices to turn on/off lights, TV viewing, etc..  Read the product description online to get a good understanding of this device and its capabilities.  I'd like to able to customize ""OK Google"" to another wakeup phrase, along with the thousands of other Home users.  Home has the ability to translate into many languages but not as many as Google Translate on my Android phone (?).  I like the instant weather and news updates just by asking ""How's my day?"".  It is a bit of a gadget and this point but I have faith that Google will make this the best on the market by bettering it's completion (Echo, Siri, Alexa).",3/4/2017,(114),(107)
14,Side by side,"The Google Home sits beside my Amazon Echo.  I've enjoyed the Echo but I wanted the vast wealth of information that Google has that is missing on the Echo.  I can't notice a difference in audio quality but my husband says the Echo sounds better. The Home gives me more music options than the Echo since my Google Play Music, Pandora and Spotify accounts are not the premium levels. One thing I miss on the Home is that the Echo can be set to sound an audible tone when it hears the wake word. I miss that handy feature on the Home. The Home handles math calculations more naturally than the Echo because it recognizes monetary terms.

Alexa, what's 20% off of ten dollars? ""20% of ten dollars is two dollars.""

Hey, Google, what's 20% off of ten dollars? ""The answer is eight US dollars.""

Obviously Google knows how I shop better than Alexa.",12/6/2016,(126),(43)
15,Can't imagine life without this now!,"I'm far more impressed than expected. Having both Amazon Echo and now Google Home, I'd recommend Google Home especially if you're a Google user. The speaker sounds amazing! I can hear music playing throughout the entire house. Google Homes capabilities are endless- plays games with you and tells jokes (kids love this!), gives me traffic updates before I leave for work in the morning, keeps track of my shopping / Christmas list, operates my TV, lights and thermostat, great for homework or just random questions. I find this to be very educational for kids.",11/15/2016,(521),(59)
16,Does less than advertised,"Though the Google Home is great for answering questions, it's ability to do much else (without paying hefty additional fees) is quite limited.  For example, you must pay an extra $30 for each light you want controlled and an extra $70 for connecting it to your TV. Even then, the functions are very basic.  The biggest drawback is that you cannot request Google Home to play a song from your music library (even using Google Music) unless you purchase a premium Google Music account.  What?!  All in all, I highly recommend that you wait to purchase Google Home until these features become standard.",9/11/2017,(60),(18)
17,Google Home is AMAZING,"I purchased this product during the $99 promotion and it is just amazing. Shipping was also fast. So seamless and intuitive, setup was a breeze. Very happy with being able to use a speaking voice (and it responds to both ""Hey google"" and ""Ok google"") and it hears/understands both me and my wife so no ""voice setup"" required like it is on your phone. Great design, very nice sound quality. There are a few features not developed yet that I really want it to do like being able to send an email or text/call, or being to understand more languages besides English- but this is definitely the future. I can see myself using this product for a long time, and starting to use more ""smart"" products so I can take advantage of the full ""smart home"" setup.

Love this!!",11/28/2016,(145),(35)
18,Smartest Member of my Family!,"It is easy to set up.   Connect it to your wireless network and download the software to your smartphone.  Easy to navigate.  She is not married and does not have any children - yes - we asked these questions.  Sadly, when asked if we could change her name she said it was too much work for google to do this :-( and yes, she did answer this question.   Keeping the google calendar linked between my phone & my desktop and now easily availabe on google home is great.  It does NOT let you ADD an appointment and I hope this becomes available.  Another reason for the 4 stars is the limited music choices compared to Alexa.  I would like to see iHeart Radio and even Sirrus radio would be nice to have too.  The kids use for homework and I'm always using it while cooking for setting timers, alarms to wake up the kids.  LOVE IT!  Definitely smarter than Alexa.",1/10/2017,(19),(5)
19,GH: The Best Voice Assistant on the Market,"The decision was simple for me, GOOGLE ASSISTANT, Google is Light Years ahead of the competition, don't believe me, ask any of the competition follow-up questions.  If you like repeating the same question with additional content (follow-up) then the GH is not for you.  BUT if you like to have a normal conversation, GH is the way to go.  Google Assistant builds on your question with answers that are more normal to human interaction.

Now if you are an Amazon person, a Prime member, one who orders a lot with Amazon,  it is understandable to use Amazon's voice assistant, easy to order and track orders.  Amazon is in the business to sell you stuff, Google is an information/search company.

You will hear/read that GH (Google Home) is limited to a small list of devices, Not True, don't believe me, go to IFTTT.com for the huge list of supported devices.  ex. WeMo Switch is not directly supported, at this time, through GH app, BUT they work great through IFTTT service, actually better since you have more options/triggers with IFTTT.

I am extremely pleased with GH, bought 2 of them, one for our daughter who is more a Google person than I.  She will love it for Christmas...Can't wait to show her the IFTTT world...",12/8/2016,(92),(26)
20,Such wonderful stereo from a Little Item,"I get Google Music which includes commercial free YouTube.  I love this device.  You have to say ""hey Google"" every time you want a new command and say it a little distance from the top.  You can ask it questions and it will answer.  I say ""Hey Google, play google music Vince Guilardi jazz album and there it goes.  You have to get the Google home app to start it up and connect it to your wifi.  Feel free to call to set it up, the guy I talked to spoke great English and was very patient with me as I'm not a youngster so I'm not familiar with electronics.  Highly recommend you don't have to worry about the music staying up on your computer.  You have to have a smart phone or tablet to use.  A laptop is not enough to set this up.",10/1/2017,(79),(52)
21,Microphone needs improvement,The microphone is useless when the speaker volume is high. Requires that you shout at the top of your voice.,3/29/2018,(0),(0)
22,I wish i could rate it lower,"I wish i could give it lower that one star. The device, although seems interesting lacks some key features, i.e. reliability and usability. let me explain.

First things first, it is not very easy to create your own playlists and/or play music. Takes a long time and effort to set it up and then it is not very easy to do unless you BUY the google play service. I think that is not very helpful.

But the bigger issue is reliability. The first unit died within two weeks. It simply will not hear anything. I tested with online support (spent a couple of hours through reset and all) and the only option they would give me is to send my unit to them (I pay for shipping and then in 5-10 business days they will send a replacement. Well lucky for me, the device was still under 30 days so easy return.

Then I bought the two pack from Costco. Configured the device and two days later it bit the dust as well. this time the device shows the 4 white dots, nothing else. no response, cannot reset nothing. Worked with support, this time I had the worst support rep, completely ignoring all messages and symptoms i sent and kept asking me the same questions over and over again. For example, after i sent the initial message (Only white colored dots...), the rep asked me what color dots and are they changing color? or how long has it been happening or does it happen with only me or anyone else also? Remember, the device is NOT working, not responding at all.

Anyways, i am very disappointed with the device quality and customer support. will NOT buy this device again.",12/3/2017,(76),(64)
23,"Best darn thing, since sliced bread.","I took a chance buying this device, because I don't own a Smart Phone, but have a Tablet with Android. That was enough, to get it working, and now it's my main source for music. It will play any song by any artist, that's within u tubes library.  Plus while your chilling on the music, you can get it to answer, almost any question you have.  To me, it's the best, of both worlds.  Really love this device, you HAVE TO GET ONE.  Sorry, about screaming, only to make a point.",12/10/2016,(40),(4)

25,Google Home Purchase,I bought this product and I am so happy and excited about it. I went home and tried it out and entertained myself for hours. My kids love asking it questions and learn from it. I use this to operate house lights (you have to purchase this separate). I am buying another one to do whole house speaker and have more than one for the bedroom and one for the living area. It is super easy to setup and user friendly. I am by far not a person who understands technology very well and I was able to get this going. This is great and my wife loves it. The speaker is really good for how small it is. I guarantee you will enjoy this product!,11/29/2016,(68),(17)
26,Let down by the music feature!,"I chose the Google Home over Amazon's Echo due to having an extensive personal library of music in Google Play.  Unpacking and using Google Home at first was great.  Ask it play any song from any artist, and it would play exactly as asked.  The more I used Google Home for music though, the more limited I found it to be.  I realized it doesn't connect to my Google Play library, and seemingly what was a trial, does not play the specific songs any longer.  It now selects ""similar playlists"" that it finds, and plays something related.  Sure, I can use it as a bluetooth speaker, but this is not what I thought I was paying for and hugely disappointed to find out this music feature is now a pay service.  So now if I want Google Home to play a specific song by an artist, I have to pay for the Premium services.  Whether its Spotify, Google Play, Pandora, or YouTube Red, guess what, you have to pay.  For many years, I have been using Google for many of their apps, services and devices, but unfortunately, this one is not for me.  Huge let down, and happily returned it today as I don't need a novelty bluetooth speaker that tells me jokes or talk about the weather.",1/10/2017,(7),(1)
27,Google Home,A welcome addition to our smart home.So much more than a speaker.,12/7/2017,(5),(1)
28,Makes life easier,Still getting used to Google Home but enjoying it so far. We are slowly adding lightbulbs and outlets to make life easier. I love being able to get my shopping list by saying what I need throughout the week. I'm confident Google will add much more to make life a little easier. The speaker sounds great for it's size and looks good too. We also bought the mini for our bedroom. Makes turning off lights feel like magic as we drift of to sleep listening to ocean waves to cover the sound of noisy neighbors. Very happy we decided to go with Google.,2/27/2018,(0),(0)

33,It is more powerful than Alexa,"Since it has access to YouTube for music and Google Assistant for internet searches, it is more powerful than Alexa.  Also Google is ahead of everyone in Artificial Intelligence which it will incorporate into the Google Home and Google Mini boxes.",10/18/2017,(14),(6)
34,Love it but lacking some expected things,"Google Home has become a daily part of my life. I look forward to using it every day, particularly when I start my mornings with asking it ""Tell me about my day"". The fact that it's so easy to integrate it with all my smart home devices and cast to it from my Android phone with ease is wonderful. The fact that I can ask it questions, and it has contextual awareness of previous questions I've asked is awesome. Music playback and being able to use it to play videos off of voice command on to my chromecast is great!

Ok, now to the things I find missing: it doesn't integrate as well with casting general audio from an iOS device. This means that you can only cast to it through apps that support casting. This is also the case with the chromecast, but honestly, considering that it is a speaker, I would at least have liked to have the bare bluetooth connectivity functionality that I expect out of other speakers in my home (or even the Amazon Echo). Also there are many commands that it says it ""can't do yet"", like adding stuff to my calendar, setting reminders, making calls, sending texts etc.. Also the device is really only tied to one familiy member's Google account, so any accounts and preferences you might have will be specific to you and not to other people that are in your home. They won't be able to play their own curated Spotify playlists or youtube playlists. That isn't to say that if you mention an artist you want to listen to, it won't auto-generate a playlist for you. 

At the end of the day, despite the lack of bluetooth capabilities and single-Account service, I have faith that Google will open up APIs for community development and even for their own service integration so that calendar, reminders, etc. actually work through it. I happened to get it at around $100, so the price point was also a big reason for me to get it over the Echo. Also, the Echo, while a bigger speaker with more mics and slightly more capabilities for the minute, is just not as smart of a device. I feel that inevitably this is Google's element and they are poised to do better than the Echo.",12/13/2016,(28),(3)
35,,"Amazing device, and even more amazing sound. For such a small unit I'm surprised how much bass it produces, and how well it fills a family room with high ceilings and a kitchen totaling around 600 sq.ft.",11/28/2017,(12),(8)
36,,"I do enjoy this product as it reminds me of the amazon alexa which I've been wanting and when got this, i just didn't enjoy it as much as i had thought i would. I just returned it because i have to almost scream for this thing to hear/understand me. :(",3/1/2018,(0),(0)
37,Amazon Echo still ahead,"The greatest thing impacting my rating is the Amazon Echo does more than Google Home. One example, is the Echo handles google calendars better than Home. Another is I have Echo linked to several Wemo devices in our home and it performs flawlessly. Home can't handle the Wemo devices yet. Many of Homes shortcomings can be overcome using IFTTT programing, but it would be nice if more functionality worked right out of the box. It also doesn't have the same capabilities as Google Now on our smart phones as far as doing internet searches. I think it will be a great device once more functionality is built in.",12/6/2016,(28),(8)

44,Need to sell my Amazon Echo,"This is a great device!  I've owned an Amazon echo for some time now, but this is definitely a better device, in my opinion.

46,Good device....needs more integration,"The speakers and microphone are very good. Its able to understand most things you tell it.

48,Love this little device!,"So easy to set-up and use, well worth your investment. It's a very useful gadget that's also attractive.  I purchased several for Christmas gifts being they were on sale. We have been using ours a lot lately in the kitchen playing Christmas music from Pandora, great sounding speaker!  It's also useful in the kitchen to set cooking timers, providing measurements, cooking instructions and setting up your grocery list, as well as checking your calendar events while having your morning coffee.   I'm hoping eventually Google will update the software to allow the user to make/receive calls or send a text. I also want them to permit the user to have options in changing it's wake-up command, I don't really care for ""Okay Google"".  I understand all this and more will be forthcoming?",12/13/2016,(13),(6)

50,Was disappointed,"Had to repeat ""Ok Google""  loudly on numerous occasions to get the  unit to respond.  Lengthy  responses from the  unit were difficult to understand at times because of words being run together and speedily spoken responses.  The sound quality for music was excellent.  The response of the Echo is superior due to the number of mics in the unit.  What troubled me most was having to repeat ""Ok Google"" at least twice 1 out of every 5 times before it would respond.  I returned the unit.  Hopefully this problem will be corrected in the future.",1/4/2017,(23),(7)
51,Wait for 2nd gen when they fix issues,"I got to test both echo dot 2nd gen and Google Home together. I have a honeywell smart thermostat, philips hue lighting and a lifx bulb.

So Google home lost out in the end! It needs a lot of work with it's integration. Even though the current price of $99 is appealing and it does have much better sound recognition, it's integration with smart things is abysmal. 
It is on the right track though and if it does not receive the Google Axe soon, it will bypass echo in it's next generation.

Problems with Home:
There is not much direct native support for many brands to start wth. So you are reliant on IFTTT to do most of the stuff. That is where the problems start. 

In the end, it was not able to do the primary job of toggling all lights upstairs on or off using one voice command..... and that did it!

Pros:
Speaker is good. Pleasent friendly human voice. Not robotic like echo.
Looks way more aesthetic than an echo.
Voice recognition is miles better than echo.
Human voice interaction is very good and again, daylights better than echo.
Love it that I can insert numbers and text in IFTTT triggers. Like I can say set the temperature to #. Or, set the bulb color to $. Something not available with echo.
It does not say ""Sending it to IFTTT"" for every IFTTT trigger like echo and I can customize what it says. More Human again.

Cons:
Cannot create groups of lights for hue. Mainly a problem with Hue itself but Echo mitigates it by providing groups. So basically, you can ask home to turn on the light in bedroom but are unable to turn on all lights upstairs with one voice command. 
Cannot toggle hue lights in IFTTT trigger. Works 1/10 times. Adds to the problem above because you cannot even use IFTTT to mitigate that by creating multiple triggers on same event. The trigger worked fine with Lifx though.
It was not able to see my bought music on Google play and play it. Kept saying my playlist is empty. gave up soon on this and just played from my phone.
Have a properietery power input. For someone who likes to hide wires behind furniture, it hinders my mobility of things. Should have been some standard USB input.",11/29/2016,(32),(6)
52,,"So far we love it, now I can listen to music whenever I want and the sound is great!!",1/6/2018,(1),(0)
53,A bit pricy but cool device,"I initially had some connection issues with the speaker to my phone but for the most part, the setup was pretty easy to do with the google home app.  

One of my initial negatives with this speaker is that it has no battery power and must be plugged into an outlet at all times.  Granted I can understand that battery drainage may be greater with this speaker because it is always on, but at this price, a battery, in addition to the power cord, should be included.   

The design is pretty simple but there are different color bases that can be purchased to give a slight different look.  I am fine with the basic look and not sure the different colors are worth the extra cost.

It is a pretty smart speaker, but some seemingly simple questions, it doesn¡¯t always know or gives incorrect answers.   Even different ways of asking the same question, sometimes confuses the speaker. It also doesn¡¯t always activate when you say ¡°Hey Google¡± either, resulting in a repeated attempt to get its attention.  Hopefully, that will improve over time as the technology improves.  It does do some things well though, such as playing songs and giving some basic information, such as the weather forecast.  I like the fact that it works with a variety of devices, such as thermostats and the like.  Some simple tasks are still not quite there though.    

Sound is decent for a speaker of its size, but of course, will not blow you away.  
  
Although I do think these smart speakers are a bit overpriced and have its limitations, it is a pretty cool device.  Hopefully, its ability will grow over time.

Phone integration would allow Google Home to send, and read texts or tweets or update your Facebook. Will allow you to say ""Ok Google call my wife*,  Google will know who your wife is, make the call then use itsself like a speaker. 

Amazon Echo will never be able to do that.",12/11/2016,(10),(2)
61,Google Home  not ready for prime time,"1) Apparently you must use a Phone or a tablet to set it up. Could not find a way to use a desktop PC
2) Music service not ready for prime time. If I ask it to play a well known artist. It first plays a little known song by that artist then then next 5 songs are a similar genre but by other artist or impersonators. Asked it to play some light music and it gave several songs with strong drums, clearly a millennial driven play list I guess. 

Clearly another example of a "" me too wanna be"" product being rushed to market before it was ready. Wait a year or more to buy this one or get one of the competitors products that have been around awhile if you just have to have a desktop speaker that tells the weather",12/27/2017,(1),(3)

In the meantime,  it's easy to utilize most by creating an IFTTT applet.   The Google Home device was easy to  set up,  and I had it connected to my Hue Bridge in minutes,  and and applets created for my Lifx lights minutes later, as well as a couple of other commands.

Still, I love it. Love speaking to a computer and have it do things for me. Love listening to music and podcasts or getting the weather, all without even touching any device. Would recommend it, but know, it's not perfect. Not even close.",12/11/2017,(1),(1)
71,"Okay for asking Qs, but novelty wears off quick","I probably had too high of expectations going in to this purchase but I was told the search engine and learning algorithms for Google are much better than the Amazon tools.

It is kind of fun asking it what sound an eagle makes or what's the population of Christmas Island, but aside from linking it to my Pandora account to play music, it's just a very pricey toy.  
 - It is worth noting that you MUST download the Google Home app in order to program the Google Home AND it must be connected to a WiFi signal all the time.  The programming is not complicated and mostly intuitive, but that might be because all I had to do was to look up my Pandora login information again.

Seems so easy for each person to have their own prompt.  And i wouldn't have boughf it if i knew you must say okay google constantly,  Can't  change the prompt and it doesn't exactly roll off the tongue.  I over estimated  Google.   And hopes for updates are seemingly poor.   I have a 14 dollar assistant on my phone I will stick with since I missed the boat on Echo for same price before xmas.   Its a glorified speaker right now.  Since I can control tv and music with phone anyway what's  the  point worth  all  these  limitations

We are very happy with Google Home and think everyone should have one.",12/7/2016,(5),(1)

I've customized it so that when I say ""good morning"" it tells me the weather, my time to work and the latest news.  It also will make you lazy!  I can tell it to play any playlist on Spotify- my own or one designed by them - and it will find it and play it.  Same with any Netflix show or movie.  There's more that I'm still toying around with, but I'm enjoying it so far.  There are alot of apps that haven't agreed to partner with this, and I hope that changes.",12/15/2017,(0),(0)
111,GOOGLE HOME SPEAKER,"I thought that this GOOGLE HOME SPEAKER, had WI-FI built into it , like a ROUTER.

152,"Bye-bye Alexa, OK Google","If you're Android family like us. It makes the most sense to use Google Home. Why Google is better than Amazon for Android users? * Better integration with your google phone, calendar, google apps etc. * Remembers context of your questions, such as Google what's on calendar this week? (your trip to Portland); Google will I need a jacket ""THERE""? Google knows you're talking about Portland, whereas Alexa gets dumbfounded! * When playing loud music, Google picks up the ""OK google"" command from across the room; whereas Alexa is a lost cause once you turn up the volume and you're far away. CONS: *Google still doesn't have as many partners to integrate light bulbs, locks, thermostats etc. I purchased Ecobee and use it via Smarthings or IFTT. Integration with other devices is just a matter of time. So if you're big into getting Alexa to turn lights ON/OFF today, you should look towards Alexa :)",3/14/2017,(0),(0)

204,Almost There,"It's clear that Google released Google Home before it was completely ready but it is also clear that it will eventually do a lot more than it does today.  Useful right out of the box but missing some basic functions (like reminders) and it does not work with as many home automation devices as Alexa. Nevertheless, I bought this because it is powered by Google and. let's face it, they are the 800 lb Gorilla of information.  I ask this things tons of questions on a daily basis and it is generally helpful (though not 100%).

209,Seems Google Search Supresses Negative Feedback,"Not worth it.  Okay, so I don¡¯t understand those complaining about difficulties with voice recognition and set up challenges.  My guess is user error.  My complaint is that once the novelty wears off (the day after the return policy expires) there¡¯s not much value.   The search results give either a long winded answer, answer to everything but what you asked, or none at all.  Surprisingly no answer at all is typical.  The games are lame.  Playing music is okay but the sound quality after lowering the volume just sounds muffled like someone placed a towel over it.  

MY BIGGEST COMPLAIINT AFTER ONE YEAR OWNERSHIP:  I set two daily alarms to remind me to take my medicine.  It worked great and I never missed a pill.  The meds are done but THE ALARMS WILL NOT STOP. This is not user error.  I previously had daily alarms that I successfully canceled.  There must have been an ¡®upgrade¡¯ and/or software change.  Who knows? What I do know is that these darn alarms go off.  EVERYDAY.  I¡¯ll say ¡°okay Google, cancel all daily alarms¡¯ and it¡¯ll confirm that all alarms are canceled.  I¡¯ll immediately ask ¡°okay Google, what alarms do I have?¡¯  It¡¯ll confirm that no alarms are pending.  The very next dog gone day the same alarms go off. 

HERE IS MY SECOND BIGGEST COMPLAINT THAT SHOULD BE FIRST:  When I use the Google search for user complaints about Google Home.....all of the top results are from Google and how amazing this product is.  All consumer complaints are suppressed.  The one time Bing is useful is to search for Google complaints...go figure.  From Bing  I have others with similar complaints and said a factory still didn¡¯t fix the problem.  The alarms seem to be linked through the user profile not the actual device.

Save yourself time, money, and frustration and just an extra five seconds to take your phone out of your pocket.  Meanwhile I¡¯ll be unplugging this listening device from my home because privacy is key.",12/12/2017,(0),(0)

246,Potential,This is a nice and emerging technology. There are thijgs that Google should have done before release. They mentioned that you can add things to uiur calen but it is not available yet. Theu should have waited to release it and made sure all features were avao at launch. Overall it is a fun device that adds a Bluetooth speaker to your home or office. The commands are simple and it is responsive. The microphone works at a good distance. There are games and one of the best features is working with other devices in the home such as lighting and your tv with Chromecast.,11/26/2016,(5),(4)

Other great features I like is when sitting around the table with my 4 children the Google Home is very helpful with homework questions. 

The only thing I would like to see is the link between my iPhone and other devices

The alarm I think should be on a different audio setting than the device itself. The alarm isn't loud enough. 

I definitely see this device well worth the money and it's future uses increasing.",1/13/2017,(1),(0)
275,Great,Love it. Own two.,7/8/2017,(1),(0)
276,I like it,I've never had the echo but I bought the google home instead my first impression is it is very responsive to voice and questions i  like it so far and i'm sure it will get better found out well doing research that it can control lights and plugs and other home automation devices since i have some of the devices it controls i tried it so now when I want to turn up temp in house i tell google set temp to  70. I bought a second one for my kids house and may get another for me as they update it,2/23/2017,(1),(0)
277,Nice product,"The voice recognition is very good and has decent reachability within a typical apartment bedroom. Provides a decent set of services like maps (ETA only), show times, Uber, Pandora, Google music to name a few..

279,Great,"Recently brought the google home and i must say im very impressed with it! sound quality for a little speaker is quite amazing, it answers all my questions with ease, and is a great alarm clock, its early days for the home and it will be rolled out across the world by the end of 2017, and it will get better and better! google have sold more homes in one month than amazon did with the echo in six months!

280,talk to me,Is great but not sure how to program it for things I want to use it for! Came with no directions,5/22/2017,(4),(4)
281,Google Home,"This is great! The only drawback is the minimal electronics that you can use with it currently. I know other companies will be jumping on the bandwagon for this. There are some that don't advertise it, yet, but their products will work with the Google Home. If you're familiar with the IFTTT site, Google Home can use some of these pre-programmed apps to shutoff/on lights and other things. It responds to your commands like you are talking to a person, whereas the Amazon Echo needs specific statements.",12/6/2016,(1),(0)
282,Better than expected,"I bought this for my husband since his heart is always for Apple but he likes to play with all the tech toys. This way he could have a Google home without feeling guilty for wasting money on it. He set it up easily and we have found it to be a lot more useful than we ever expected. Especially since our hands out usually full with a newborn baby. Google has answered questions about newborns sneezing, played songs to lull/dance with the baby too, and tells me the time for breastfeeding all at a simple voice command.  She's also become part of our morning routine in just one week as we are feeding/changing the baby she tells us the weather and starts our news briefing from our chosen sources. We have both been rather impressed overall and as regular users of Siri and Alexa, we didn't think we would be. Well done Google.",12/31/2016,(0),(0)
283,it don't work as I thought,"I ask it for many thinks and keep say Sorry I can'r help you with, or I still learning it obvious that it really is a disappointment for me",10/17/2017,(1),(5)
284,Best Purchase EVER!,Easiest electronic to set up that I've ever bought.  The ability to have appointments for 3 family members just a request away is so very helpful and convenient!  I can get time and temperature anytime and ask questions that most of the time the Google Assistant can answer.  Best thing ever and would recommend to those who could use a bit of help in keeping up with appointments or just having the ability to obtain information by just asking!!,1/15/2017,(1),(0)
285,Met expectations,"questions and commands have to be phrased in a certain way or else they won't br understood, but I expected that. You also have to pause a little bit after waking it up before you ask a question or give a command.  I expected response to be a bit faster, but I can deal with it as it is.  Overall, very satisfactory.  We are learning more about it's capabilities.",3/12/2017,(1),(0)
286,Google away from screen,"I always hated when people take out their smart phones to check a fact. Now I can check basic information in my kitchen, have translations and animal sounds for the small ones. I believe that the smart phone will be less and this kind of voice recognition systems more.
If you accept the creepy always listening part, then we can recommend the permanent Google presence in your house.",2/26/2017,(1),(0)
287,"Amazing Technology, Super Easy Purchase","First off, kudos to Walmart for it's ""Pick it up today"" service.  During the height of holiday shopping all I had to do was purchase online (so I was sure it was in stock) and just go down and pick it up without any waiting, searching or drama.  Great system!

As far as the Google Home product it is absolutely amazing. We haven't even scratched the surface of it's current capabilities and Google hasn't even scratched the surface of it's future capabilities.  It's fun (has games, jokes and wisecrack responses). It's smart (Answers nearly every question we threw at it). It's intuitive (I requested a song by merely singing a line from the song and after playing the song it kept playing similar music until I asked it to stop).  The sound is really good for such a small unit. Nice bass.  It's also amazing how far away from it I can be and it still works. I was telling my wife in our bedroom about what I had just said to it and it picked it up all the way from the living room and responded. It's also really an attractive addition to the decor.

As you might have picked up I was very pleased.  So much so that we bought one for both our son and daughter for Christmas.",1/6/2017,(0),(1)

289,I bet in a couple years it will be a lot better,Got Google home for my girlfriend for xmas. The whole family had fun with it. Her parents and her daughter.  The only thing that I disliked was that the volume was hard to get to go up and down. We kept saying. Ok Google. Turn the music up or down.  And it seemed like it was having trouble understanding. But all in all it is a cool item. We still use it but not as much as thought we would. But for 150 you can't really complain.,1/6/2017,(1),(0)
290,Great Product,"Glad i got this product. I got the first one and liked it so well i bought another

291,HEY GOOGLE,"I purchased four of these  for Christmas.  Three were gifts for my children and their families and on was for myself.  Google home was easy to install and I had it up and running within a matter of minutes.  A great value, the sound quality of the music is excellent.  Now, my grand daughters may wear Google out with their constant questions and request for music, but so far it is working excellently! :-)",1/11/2017,(2),(1)
292,SO SO,"I also have a dot and Alexa.  The dot is the best.... (not for sound) with Google Home it pop's and crackle. When playing my local Radio. Google does not have as many app's and does not do as much as Dot & Alexa.  Google technicians need to get to work!!!!!!
If I had purchased Google Home I would take it back for a refund. But as a gift it works good in the kitchen.",2/6/2017,(2),(1)
293,It is a very fun and good product.,I purchase the Groupon because I thought it'd be a nice product to get and I liked it very much ever since I got home it's been very it was easy to set up and very easy years it's had a couple of glitches though but it was pretty minor I just had to reset it and stop working for a bit and then I just unplugged it and plugged it back in so I would recommend it to others is a very fun product to use.,1/14/2017,(1),(0)
294,Google Home is fun,"We bought a google home for ourselves (we're in our 60's) and use it to answer questions and play music. It works perfectly for that.
We bought each of our adult children one for Xmas knowing they would get the same enjoyment we do out of it plus they are more tech savvy than us to add things like lights, chromecast etc. 
We feel it's a great gift idea, we even bought one for a  20 year old granddaughter away at college.",12/6/2016,(1),(0)
295,Go Google,"In Puerto Rico non functional. Even if you ask gooogle what is the fee for a US passport renewal it comes back with the fee in British pound.

297,Decent,Works really well. It is a lot of fun. The game show is fun to play. Lots of trivia questions. Is not too accurate when taking music requests after the You Tube Red free trial is over. That part I do NOT like. But overall it is a pretty awesome unit.,3/9/2017,(2),(1)
298,LOVE IT.,"Sounds great!!  
 My daughter and I love it. 

 We love music & it plays just about any song  thru U Tube Red. 

The device comes with a free 6 month free trial of utube Red 
Not sure how much access to music we will have after free trial is up. 

Google Home will pay trivia games with you which my 16 year old daughter really loved.

I purchased this for fun and now am using it as a timesaver business tool.,1/14/2017,(1),(0)

We use the music and enjoy that and have her run a trivia game from time to tim.",12/7/2016,(1),(0)
306,"Decent speaker, fun tool.","Sound quality is good. Better than the echo.  Has to play music from a premium account like spotify or YouTube red, or your personal library. We have all those so no biggie. But if you dont have any set up and only have Amazon prime, you are gonna just want to get the echo. Main issue I have is it usually only responds to my husbands voice and if the volume is over 8, forget about it responding at all. I don't like that it has to have 100% full access to my phone just to set up a shopping list, for, now I will be doing my shopping list the old fashion way. Otherwise it cokes in handy for wanting music for,my disabled son, or looking up nutrition information while cooking.",12/28/2016,(1),(1)

The voice on GA is really friendly  and when it can't answer a question,  the reply is I haven't learn that yet.  I  like the color,  it doesn't stick out and being smaller is great.",9/19/2017,(0),(0)

341,Home automation and information,"I have now purchased two Google Home's. They are an incredible device. If you want o automate your home or just use it to gain information, drink ideas, dinner and recipes. This is the product for you. Best part, I am not locked into one retailers ecosystem and can choose who to shop with, if I enable the shopping features.",8/7/2017,(1),(3)

343,Nice device,Excellent gadget,7/20/2017,(1),(1)
344,NEEDS A FEW ADJUSTMENTS,"My complaints with this are: 1) The alarm even at max volume is not very loud at all. And the alarm sound is a very mellow sound. More of a sound that puts you to sleep, not wake you up! 2) Not set up yet for reminders. 3) When playing music, and I ask Google to stop, it can't hear me, and I am yelling stop! I have to get up and go tap the top of it to stop the music. 4) Unable to look up TV schedules. But overall, I am happy with Google Home. I think it has some bugs as mentioned to be worked out. But it has a ton of knowledge. Ask it most anything. Music sounds great. And you can talk with it very natural. Get your weather in seconds. I sure wished we could give each Google Home it's own name instead of having to say Hey Google all of the time.",12/18/2016,(0),(0)
345,Not yet ready for the future...or the present,"It's been said Google Home resembles an air freshener, but in its present form, it serves less of a useful function.  The unit uses a truncated Google Assistant compared to the functions you get from the google bar on your phone, and it's ""future home"" functions are very limited and the required  add-on devices are limited and can be quite costly.  The OK GOOGLE trigger word often is not heard the first time and you end up feeling like a maniac as your voice gets louder and angrier when it does not respond as wanted.  It has trouble finding songs in my Google Play music library, and there are many things that it does not know how to do yet.  Unlike the Amazon Echo interface which has Add-Ons called SKILLS that you can enable.  Google Home can only be updated as Google adds features.  
The price is too high for this, what feels like a pre-Beta release!  The deals from Black Friday at $99 is even too high for what this currently is.  Considering you can get an Amazon Echo Dot for $49 which does and understands a lot more, it is hard to justify the price tag.  Even Amazon's original Echo device which is normally at $189 is a better functioning deal in that the 360 degree speaker blows the Google Home speaker away, and does so much more.",12/29/2016,(0),(0)
346,The best is it's potential!,The ability to be able to control with just the sound of your voice!,10/10/2016,(37),(112)
347,This is a great item. Love it!!,"This is a great quality item and the built-in speaker puts out a clear, strong sound. My 14 year old son set up everything and it is easy to use. We own 4 of them now so everyone in our family can enjoy their own music and operate different lights in the house. We also hooked up the Phillips hue lighting system and the Chromecast Ultra to work with our Google Home. It is great for my 85 years young dad to use and he can now enjoy movies and documentaries on the TV without having to use all of the different remotes to get it. All he has to do is tell Google Home to play it on the TV for him! We are very happy with all aspects of this great addition to our home. We were so happy with ours, we gave the neighbor one!!",1/5/2017,(0),(0)
348,"Quality Sound, Very Responsive","We got our Google Home about a month ago and weighed its purchase vs. Amazon's Echo. While the Google Home doesn't have as much functionality of the Echo yet... the sound quality is outstanding and because Google is ""open-source,"" we believe it will have as many if not more functionality very soon. There is no comparison between Google's assistant who answers in full sentences and is lots of fun to chat with at parties. It does integrate with Nest, Google Keep (a list and organizer like Evernote), and many other products. We're very pleased with its purchase and are looking forward to seeing what else it can do over the next year.",12/10/2016,(1),(3)

350,Smartphones,"Forgive me I have no clue of what this item really can do, but when I see that you can do a search, well can't my cellular device do this same thing?????",12/8/2016,(7),(20)
351,Stick with the Amazon Echo,"We have two Amazon Echos and love them.  They have great sound, and have apps that let me access, review and add to my google calendar, and hundreds of other free available applets.  I bought this thinking that it would let me have greater integration and control of my various google/android products.  We use G-Suite (formerly Google Apps for Business) at my office, which is a business suite sharing gmail, calendars, etc.  Unfortunately, Google Home will not access any of this.  So, Echo is better in this regard.  Likewise, Echo has a far superior speaker and sound for playing music, and even voice interaction.  I'll stick with the Echo until something changes.",12/27/2016,(0),(0)
352,Recommended!,Not sure how I lived before Google Home. Love the news / weather updates and alarm functionality; have even used it to successfully create a calendar. I decided to buy this since I use Google products in my life quite a bit and I don't necessarily buy a lot in ecommerce. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],7/24/2017,(0),(0)
353,Waiting for updates,"This is almost as amazing as they say. Don't get  me wrong...I love it. So far I've had 3 friends buying it because of my excitement about it. The shopping list is great...syncs right to my phone.  She's good for a laugh sometimes with her answers (the jokes are a little corny)...but I didn't buy it for that.
I just thought the calendar assistant would be working a lot better. I use the Google calendar.
It would be GREAT if she told of new updates. I DO ask her if she learned anything new.
Sometimes she can give me a recipe....sometimes she ""doesn't know how to help with that.""  Hmmmmm
I have until Feb. to return it if I feel that it's not what I wanted it for.",12/7/2016,(0),(0)

355,Very useful assistant at home !,"I liked it a lot. It lets me do google search via voice. It searches youtube videos and casts to my tv. It sets temperature on my nest thermostat. We use mainly for setting timers, hearing news/weather . We can verde with Google home normal language as its good with context based searches. As this is AI based, it should become even easy to converse with it with time.",12/9/2016,(1),(1)

358,OK GOOGLE,"Product works awesome! Simply take out of box, plug it in,  download GoogleHome.com on your phone, home computer, tablet, Google Home will pick it up (like bluetooth) and ask away!
I bought this for my mother, for when she was a little girl she had to use an  encyclopedia to get answers. Lol
She loves it so easy to ask a question and get a quick answer or even ask it to play one of her favorite songs I downloaded for her.
Now she wakes up asks it about the days weather, news, appointments, heck I even install a nest on the wall now it can control the heat and cooling!

360,GOOGLE HOME ROCKS,This little gadget is incredible.  The sound is great.  I love listening to music on it.  Great sound.

368,Google home is a nice addition,I just purchase a Google home and I like the size and the fact that you can change the base of it to other colors. It is very similar to the Amazon Echo. The echo at the moment does more than the home does. But I think after time that will not be the case. You can use it to turn on your lights and some appliances in your house and you can also use multiple ones in different rooms and they will not interfere with each other. Where is the Amazon Echo has that problem. But that is because it is new on the market and of course Google has not worked out quite all the bugs yet but I'm sure they will.,12/10/2016,(0),(0)
369,Great! Especially for new technology...,"This item works great so far. It can answer most questions  and if you have Smartthings by Samsung it can be integrated to control my Nest Thermostat. The only cons are its not wireless, bluetooth compatible, and if the music's too loud sometimes Google  won't hear you.  Once it gains some ""skills"" and can do things like set reminders it will be amazing.  Would buy again.",12/15/2016,(1),(2)

374,Pretty cool device,"I wasn't sure what I would think of Google Home. My kids were very excited and pushed me to get it and I am glad I did.  At a basic level it handles music very well and expands our choices beyond my owned catalog.  It also handles questions (searches) well.  Allows us to answer questions and add some data to dinner table conversations.  I don't have any smart appliances or lights so not sure how well that works.  I'm looking forward to some ecommerce integrations soon.

375,Worked for about an hour...,"This is was gift for Christmas, had trouble with it connecting to my Wi-Fi (was not a Wi-Fi issue) finally connected after about 15 tries. Worked for about a hour then we heard a pop and static throughout various plays. Unplugged a couple of times didn't work. I did love it while it did work. Going to see if I can exchange for the same. If still having the issue I'm purchasing an Echo.",12/28/2016,(1),(3)
376,"It is not perfect, but darn close","I wanted mood music to go along with daily activities like dinner or exercise.  This little buddy tries its heart out.  Its limitation is that is cannot access all music, undoubtedly due to copyright laws, unless you want to pay for a particular service.  The sound is fabulously rich for such a little thing...no tininess.  It has the added bonus that you ask it about the weather or other questions when you think of them, and it just interrupts the current song for a few moments.  Beware, you must have a wireless system for it to work.",1/23/2017,(0),(0)
377,Not impressed.,"Not very impressed with Google Home so far. Have tried repeatedly to get it to connect with my calendar, to no avail.  I would like it to be able to read my calendar for appointments, birthdays, etc.
Ask it to remind me to take my pills at a certain time and it said it could not do that at this time. I had to set a timer instead. It would be better if it could tell me to take my pills. Perhaps it will be able to do that in the future with upgrades.
It is good for information and weather forecasts.",2/28/2017,(0),(0)
378,Great for kids and the entire family,"I love this product, the language translation is very nice for us since our son goes to a French school and it will translate French words and phrases. It will even translate French into English!!!! 

I also tend to look up a lot of useless stuff like ""When Babe Ruth retired"" and I can ask home that kind of stuff and it will tell me so I'm not on my phone as much.

379,Haven't stop using it!,"I bought Google Home as a last minute Christmas gift for my husband since he commented on how nice it would be to have every time he saw the commercial. After reading and comparing reviews between Google and Echo, Google was an all around favorite. The price was better and another option Echo does not have, is you can turn the ""listening"" off, so it is not constantly listening. Google more accurately provided responses too according to reviews. We are still learning everything this product can do, but so far love the quick ability to get answers to pretty much any question and listen to instant music. You can use a variety of platforms-You Tube, Pandora, etc. One thing to note, this products response time is dependent on your internet connection and speed, so if your internet is slow, it does not function as well and will pause as a song plays and the response time is slower. The only other thing I noticed was it does not ""hear"" you if the volume is turned all the way up. It has a touch control top though and you can control features such as volume here as well. Various volume settings allow for listening throughout our home.  Set up was very easy. Google will also interact with you and tell jokes, Mad Libs, and trivia. My 9 yr old son gets a kick out of it and loves it. We look forward to adding more features such as the ability to control lighting. My only con- I wish I would have purchased it during Black Friday when it was on sale.",1/5/2017,(0),(0)
380,For me.... it's a toy.,"I love this ""toy"".  Very new because it doesn't have everything set up for it yet. The price is right! That's excellent! Yet, it's still very new technology that JUST came out yesterday. If you're patient worth technology and want it because of the excellent price, this is what you need.",12/2/2016,(1),(2)
381,Love my Google Home!,"Setup for this was a breeze! I love the convenience and fun of using my Google Home. I can't wait to get more smart devices I can connect it to. The best part is being able to play my music and the speaker is phenomenal. Flip a coin, give me the weather, play a game, tell a joke, look something up, what's on my calendar, add to my shopping list, play the news, say goodnight, even sing happy birthday and so much more.

382,Better than Alexa but has room to grow,"I have owned an Alexa for over a year now but decided to get a Home as well. They are quite similar - especially in terms of functionality they basically do the same things. But, I enjoy Google Home more because she has a personality - builds humor into her responses (for example, ask her if she is a Democrat or a Republican!). The biggest con is the only way to wake her up for an interaction is by saying ""ok google"" and that gets old fast. Overall, I highly recommend Google Home Assistant as your new home companion!",12/29/2016,(0),(0)

Best of all, it's connected to a better search engine and understands more natural speech than the Amazon Echo, in my experience (I do also have an Echo, and it is also very good).

And I love the elegant design, it fits in much better than Amazon Alexa.",2/8/2017,(0),(0)
414,Google doesnt know much,I'm not sure this rating is fair. I gave this to my blind dad thinking he would have all the answers just by asking. So far it cannot answer many seemingly simple questions. It does well on weather and news and playing music. I'm not sure it is set up correctly  because a Google search on the computer can find the answers.,1/11/2017,(0),(1)
415,Cool,"It's in the early stages so don't expect too much but it does a lot from weather, traffic, turning on/off lights (requires smart light/hub) Turns shows on TV (requires chromecast) But even at it's basic functions the timer is very useful less things are getting burnt these days.",2/2/2017,(0),(0)
416,Family loves it,This was so easy to set up and get started. It has what we wanted and has yet to be stumped on a question. Voice activation has a great reach. So far it has been fun and educational. Bought it during the discount and has been worth it. Went between this and an Echo. most things I have is Google oriented and went with this.,1/3/2017,(0),(0)
417,Google Home,This product is very responsive to voice commands providing relevant information just when it is needed. Google Home has a high-quality speaker that delivers clear sound at all volumes. Google Home is both information utility and 'toy.'  It was easy to setup. We had it out of the box and working in less than ten minutes.,1/4/2017,(0),(0)
418,good but not great,"I had already bought an echo, but but it's terrible at answering general knowledge questions.  Google Home is much better.at that, but cannot pair with my Bluetooth home theater for music.",3/10/2017,(0),(0)
419,Sound is great,"but not enough things to do with it so far.  I'm using it with IFTTT to control my WEMO and for that it is good.  It also answers more questions than the nearest competitor and can interpret spoken language better. Google needs to catch up to the other lady, A........a in applications though.",1/19/2017,(0),(0)

422,Couldn't get it connected to the router,The product itself looks good and would be fun to use but you need to have it connected to your wifi in order for it to work.  We were unable to connect to the Comcast router so it's going back.   It's disappointing but there's no immediate answers as to what the problem is.,1/25/2017,(0),(0)
423,Not yet ready for prime time,"I own the Alexia and 3 dots, but I thought I would give Google a try.
I should have waited until Google actually supports anything worth while. 
Yes using IFTTT you can make Google work with some devices, but out of the box it's pretty lame.
No native support for Wink hubs or harmony hubs means I will be sticking with my Alexia for now.",12/10/2016,(0),(0)
424,Can't hear me,When I bought this I realized it was new and didn't have as much to offer as Amazon Echo but I figured that would quickly change. What I didn't expect was that the Home doesn't hear my voice well. With volume set at six  I can stand close and scream and not be heard. I returned Home and bought and Echo.,1/4/2017,(0),(1)

427,New Favorite Toy,"Haven't had so much technological fun in a long time. Google Home has become a member of the family -- way smarter than my wife and me.

453,Almost there,"The Google Home is great.  I'm glad they finally came out with a competitor for the Amazon Echo.
