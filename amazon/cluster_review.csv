0,14,the only positive thing about this is using it at low volume. the range is not there.  the bluetooth is decent. the line in option did not work.  if i could have found the receipt i would have taken it back.  i will use it at work since it functions best at low tone. but honestly. my iphone 8 is right behind it speaker quality wise and my sonos speakers all blow this out of the water on every level.  it just can not compare to them yet. .  i am rather disappointed with this amazon device..
1,14,"app on i phone does not work, cannot delete it, information on amazon does nothing....frustrated"
2,6,"the sound is unbelievably good; however, i have found that when asking to raise the volume, it does not raise the level but a trivial amount in some instances. overall, a fun and great product."
3,4,family loved it!
4,7,"i enjoy my echo it is very satisfying, thank you amazon."
5,7,love my alexa! in fact i have two! i often wish she could go in the car with me too!! haha
6,7,i like everything about my new echo.  the sound is beautiful.
7,7,i love it!
8,6,i love the new echo 2nd generation. it is slot more compact and the sound is really clear!  i highly recommend this to everyone.
9,14,"echo is fine once (if) you get it programmed.  programming is a nightmare.  you have to call their support (india) and deal with people who are reading it from a manual.  echo support tried to help me sync my calendars with alexa.  after 45 minutes on the phone, they could not do it and had corrupted my i-phone, ipad, and macbook air.  they said, ""sorry, we can not help you now.  it is an apple problem!""  4 hours with apple support and still not resolved.  alexa, you are not ready for the public yet!  too many glitches if you want anything they promise other than the very basic stuff!"
10,14,"needs to have amazon music unlimited for full function...... not just prime, be ready to shell out more $$$ per month. wish i knew this before purchasing. amazon was clever in offering amazon music unlimited for a few dollars for 3 months. not too far out from purchase time to return."
11,7,i am very disappointed. my fist echo is so much better. the sound quality is poor.
12,7,i love the sound and all that i can do with the echo.
13,4,love it!
14,14,when i first received it as a gift for christmas i was happy and a couple weeks after having it she just started going off on her own even if we do not call her...i¡¯m thinking she might have a lil glitch but other then that i love it
15,7,everything i hoped for.  i love how it controls my smart home.
16,14,i am still new at it but i am enjoying both products
17,14,its not wireless.
18,7,great sound and all the great echo features all in one!
19,4,perfect helper for forgetful minds!
20,14,yes i just love it i use it at my office. it helps me with tasks and music. i just love it!
21,7,i love it
22,6,sound quality
23,7,i like everything about it.  there are so many features to it that we have not even explored yet!
24,7,"so far, i can ask what day it is and what time it is.apparently i must become a prime member to use the full features of this device."
25,14,"so far i am enjoying trying the different features - the sound quality is great for music.  the volume on the alarms (alexa, set a  timer for 10 minutes) is almost inaudible.  i have to figure out how to raise this volume level.  but, so far so good!"
26,14,my grandson enjoyed his echo
27,7,"started off great, but out of nowhere the sound started being fuzzy and poor quality. nothing i did to remedy the situation seemed to work. real bummer."
28,14,"purchased this item to be used by an 87 year old woman with macular and neurological problems due to a stroke. the installation was so easy and not only does she now know what day it is, thank you alexa, she calls her family and friends and does not reach the wrong party, with just a voice control. thank you amazon for such a great product."
29,7,so easy to get started.
30,7,it is great we love it!!
31,14,"first the bad news---setting it up is challenging!  the good news---love it!!!  sound quality and amplification are better than we predicted.  in the short time we have had it, we have really enjoyed it!"
32,14,"i¡¯ve had echos since they first was launched. i also have two echo shows as well. have one in every room. love them all. use them many times a day. would now be lost without them. helps in so many daily task. love the hands few making shopping list, baking and doing multiple timers. adding app to calendar by voice. listening to any music the suits you mood. i use them with smart lighting, and smart plugs..etc. it is a buy, that you¡¯ll never know how you did without. and it is easy to set up, and as always amazons customer service is  phenomenal."
33,7,i was very impressed with the sound that was what i like the most there was really nothing i had like the lease about the system
34,7,"the echo has been really great so far. super convenient to find out information or play music just by asking it to. the only issue i have had is some times when i ask it to look up some information, the answer it gives me is completely unrelated."
35,7,"she is a great digita assistant but in order to use her full potential, you must have a lot of smart features, but she is fun and easy to use.  i love her jokes and flattery."
36,7,everything the temperature out side music anything you ask she replies my kids love it to
37,7,"the speaker is stylish and has great sound.  i use it daily for music, checking schedules, and answering questions.  i am eager to start using smart devices with it next."
38,7,as advertised. love it!
39,7,works as advertised.
40,14,does not work rite.  will not play my prime music.  emailed tech support.  no help at all!!!!  am thinking of sending it back to amazon and getting my money back.
41,7,ease of use. nothing found yet i do not like
42,0,espectacular
43,6,crear product
44,7,it is just a lot of fun everyday you find new things to do!!! i really like everything
45,7,"quick response. very knowledgeable, lots of fun.capabilities are incredible"
46,14,"i wish we could play apple music or connect this to our smart tv for an extra speaker.  it is kinda worthless for us, except my kid loves to ask it questions, most of which it can not answer or quotes wikipedia.  it looks nice though, hence at least one star"
47,14,"it is horrifying to know that anyone can ""drop in"" to your house, unannounced, and listen in on your home life. when you sync alexa to your phone it extracts all of your personal contact information so that you can accidentally call your boss and your babysitter or co-worker can listen in on your private home conversations. you can not fix this with blocking the caller. i called amazon customer support and they assured me that they do not share my contacts with others, but the customer service rep admitted that she could see all my contacts on her computer screen. when i asked her to delete the contacts she said all she could do was ""unlink"" them but she could not delete them, saying ""it is just not possible, but do not worry, we will not look at them"". i asked if this information was stored on the alexa device, and if i returned it is the data there? to which she responded ""do not worry, we will not look at it"". that is not reassuring at all. now i do not know whether to return it or not because now my personal data is on this device and if it is returned and sent to another person now they have all my data too...plus it is all in amazon is databases now."
48,7,she is pretty amazing and easy to use!
49,7,alexa is so much fun. sound quality is amazing. set up is super easy. i liked it so much i bought the echo dot as well
50,14,"i do like this product. it was very fun when it was first introduced into the family. i have had it for about one month and it has lost the interest of my family members. it is rarely used unless company comes over and they ask to see what it can do. last night alexa was not responding well and kept telling me to ""try again later"". so i unplugged it and tried again. still not working properly. kind of disappointed with my purchase. but it was fun for a while."
51,14,i like the size and sound of this echo. it does not get quite loud enough though.
52,14,"does the job i want. do not expect great sound from it. the little guy is good; if you want to add logitech gear to it for $35, you are ahead."
53,7,great sound!did not know i needed to pay for the music.great purchase!!!!
54,6,sound quality is excellent.alexa is fun and informative!
55,4,great product!  family loves it!  our second echo!
56,7,i can play any music i am in the mood for.  sound quality is better than my radios i use to use for my music.
57,14,love it !!
58,7,great addition to updating our technology.  ...so much to learn about it yet.
59,7,"this is the best!!! we love it!! works great, we use it a lot for music. the speaker is great and we are very picky about sound. we have it connected to a lamp. it works from upstairs."
60,14,she is a little creepy but otherwise great.  i bought it due to local radio station app but found out it is not live radio rather the type of music they play.
61,14,"the sound is great and omnidirectional, no matter where you are in the room it sounds the same. ive played some music on it but mostly im enjoying my audio books on it. and i hear it with perfect clarity as i move about the room. by comparison i have other speakers but they sound best when its facing you."
62,7,we absolutely love alexa!  so helpful with many aspects of day to day life!
63,4,best investment ever!
64,14,"great smart speaker. my only complaint is that alexa occasionally can not access the network and asks me to try again later. i have her connected to wireless over att gigabit, so it is kind of weird.  i¡¯ve found that leaving the echo plugged in ameliorates the problem. turning the speaker off seems to make it have network issues when i reboot."
65,7,it is not able to get me routes or the weather. sometimes while playing music from my spotify library just stops suddenly.
66,7,"this simply has become a useful household helper and entertainment source. my favorite feature is the shopping list...well, all the lists. i am much more organized and having fun being this way."
67,4,we love it.  my grandson loves to ask it to tell jokes and play music.  husband loves the music. it is really funny when it responds to something said on tv.
68,7,love it
69,14,fun to have around. amazon music pales to itunes but does ok in the voice-on-demand world.
70,14,"sound quality is excellent.  had a difficult time understanding how to get music.  also, in setting up a playlist.  still not sure we know how to use it, as when i go to amazon music to work on my playlist, and then ask the echo to play it, it is not a smooth transition.  more instructions would have been very helpful."
71,14,i did not know i had to belong to prime in order to have echo play music.  i was emailed that i would get a reduced rate for a year to try it out but by the time i saw this invite to do so it was too late for me to respond.
72,14,i love my echo!  i had been asking for one for awhile and finally got one.
73,7,love the speakers and sound. but gives me the weather from another town.
74,4,purchased as a gift for my brother. he loved it so much he purchased one for each room in his house.
75,14,well worth the wait.  i originally bought a dot last year. while the dot was good this new version of the echo surpasses it. great sound quality. seems to have better voice recognition as it responds faster and picks up your voice easier. my only grip with any of the echo are when watching wwe.  when alexa bliss is wrestling my echo is constantly says sorry but i do not understand your request.  lol
76,14,"my mom is echo dot was sometimes frustrating to use, so i got her this as a replacement for christmas. the sound is about on par with the previous generation echo (i own that one) but it is abolity to understand you is greatly improved! no more trying to shout over the music and washing machine. the echo dot is not obselete though; that is just been moved to a less-used room. fully satisfied with the purchase.also, i would like to note that the shell of the device is changable, in case something happens to damage it, it gets old and dirty, or you just want to change things up. i did not realize that before purchasing, which is funny since i am usually very observant about what i buy. this feature makes cleaning the echo less scary, you can just take off the outer shell and clean it if needed, rather than risking pushing dust further into it."
77,14,just received my echo and i¡¯m so in love!! must buy !update: i¡¯ve ordered two more after the first one. amazing
78,14,i love alexa.... this new model does have better sound but it is not close to replacing my stereo or even my even my harmon kardon onyx bluetooth speakers.  but it is perfect when my 3 year old wants to hear something (yes he can tell alexa what he wants all by himself <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+009c>) or when several of us are together and it is just kind of spontaneous where wants us to hear something and then someone else dose.  it is perfect for those occasions.  also you can listen to podcasts this way or even get a quick roundup of the news..  oh yea and she will even say goodnight! and turn your light off!!
79,14,"before i purchased my echo, i thought it would be a mere novelty item. admittedly, i could survive without it, but it has definitely made my life easier and a bit more fun! alexa has proven herself to be more helpful than i would have imagined.she helps wake me up with her insightful flash briefings, while in the shower (yes, we have a very intimate relationship). she can play just about any song or type of music for me through prime music. she is even a great sous chef, helping me convert measurements, set timers, and update my shopping list. i have her hooked up with my smart lights, so that i can turn the lights off with my voice from bed. she even talks to my tesla and tells it to turn on the heater on cold mornings, so that i have a warm car to get in to. i enjoyed her company so much, that i got her a little sister, the echo dot. now i can talk to alexa in the kitchen and bathroom! i love that they can play music in sync, so that i can walk around my house and hear it from all rooms.all in all, it is a great device, and i know it will keep getting smarter and adding new features, which is awesome. the speaker is surprisingly good for such a small speaker. it obviously will not be able to compete with a large theater system, but for my small apartment, it is perfect. i also love the stylish cover. it looks super classy sitting on my kitchen counter, so i do not feel embarrassed about having a virtual assistant sitting in my kitchen. i had a slight issue with my echo when i got a new router, but i contacted the amazon support people, who were able to help me through it. great support team by the way!"
80,7,it is great
81,7,i like the technology a ai in my home i can make commands and ask questions. i like it!
82,14,"it works ok, alexa is not as smart as the commercials say"
83,6,good sound quality
84,14,my family and i wonder how we got along without the echo.  i had a little trouble connecting to my network but even that was not a major problem.  setup and configuration was a breeze (once connected to the network).  i am going to love playing with this thing.
85,7,"i love her. no, not that way lol.  shes very helpful."
86,7,"it is everything and more than i thought it would be.  i love that alexa starts my day with ""news briefing"" and ""local weather report"" daily.  there is nothing i do not  like about my echo and dot.  love my ai."
87,14,this is the 3rd echo we have purchased. the first with the improved sound. my husband use it in his office and is quite happy with the quality of the sound. he play music on it primarily and enjoys it thoroughly.
88,7,love my echo..... so really awesome
89,14,i love it
90,7,love alexa. very handy.
91,14,i know there is some playing a game when you order a product for prices - especially around the holidays but i am a bit frustrated at amazon.  the echo was on sale for $79.99 - they upped the price to $99.99 - then offered a deal for $50 off three.  i ordered the three and thought - well i missed out on the $79.99.  now i see they are back to $79.99 so  i paid more for getting the discount of three $50.  seems they offer those of us that got the three a credit back.  tempted to return and order at the lower price.
92,14,it is good
93,4,it was gift for my family. we love it. my 14 yo checks the weather in the morning. my 3 year old has song requests all by himself.
94,14,"it is a good speaker to have but the sound lacks low frequency base. also, it randomly turns on by itself and it feels it is listening when it is not supposed to."
95,7,"i love the reminders as well as the ""question of the day""!"
96,14,i love my echo.  it is the 2nd one i bought.
97,6,this is the most useful product i have bought since the first iphone in 2007. speaker sound is outstanding!!!! deep bass. clear and crisp highs and good mids. even at full volume the sound is clear and distinction.
98,6,"better shape and size, better controls with no loss in sound quality."
99,4,love it!!
100,7,"love it, like really love it!"
101,14,gave this 4 stars only because i hate how you can not use the speaker wirelessly...
102,7,i love this!  was so easy to set up.
103,7,i love this little amazing echo! the sound is amazing and cannot wait to experiment more of what it can do
104,14,it sounds great. i only use it for music. i would give it 5 stars if it was rechargeable.
105,14,"it is an expensive play toy. it claims it can read calendar or messages but be aware that is really not the case. as long as you are happy with their apps ok, but i use outlook (not outlook.com). messaging only works for alexa to alexa user. i read where amazon is supposed to add sms to alexa, but that was last august and this is jan and it is still not there.  there are lots of other things i wish it could do that are very basic. however i am finding apps that will provide this functionality (for a charge). this is basic stuff and should have been included in the alexa the getgo."
106,7,mostly love it. although she does not seem to know a lot of the answers to the questions i ask.
107,4,we love alexa
108,14,"this is a review of the list echo i received. love the sound; alexa gets more and more accessible, that is useful. but the sound has an annoying habit of cutting out from time to time for short or even longer lengths of time and sometimes cuts completely off. i tried to get some help from the techs provided but they did not know what to do except uninstall it and then re-install, which did no good. so i sent this one back and got a replacement. in the interim i found out that in the confusion i had signed up for a trial period of amazon unlimited. so when the new one came i changed over to amazon music and, guess what, no cut outs. so i am figuring the problem is with the unlimited. i cut the subscription down to one devise and will use amazon music instead for most of my listening."
109,14,"just what i expected, i strongly recommend."
110,7,great technology. hands free information. great speakers.
111,7,very happy with this purchase and the price. the echo is a lot of fun to use and very helpful for a lot of things. great for turning on and off smart bulbs and smart plugs.
112,7,everything i thought it would be
113,7,works great
114,7,ease of use
115,7,we have it in our kitchen and listen to music all the time.  the sound is great!
116,14,love this guy so much! only rarely does it not understand me and that is the only real complaint i have. i use it in my salon as a stereo and also like it for the timer it has in it. i recommend it for music lovers as that is what i mainly use it for!
117,7,"love it, can not wait to change things in my home to become a smart home."
118,14,sound is very good. i am disappointed in answers. i get referred to other aps instead of direct answers?
119,0,simply amazing!
120,6,excellent product
121,14,i like the smaller size and the choice of textured color sleeves.  the sound seems slightly improved and it is still a hefty little cylinder.  no need to get rid of the original though.  i just moved it to the bathroom for tunes while we shower.
122,14,it worked for about 3 weeks then quitit no longer powers on
123,14,love the sound. love the look not to gouty. only thing not really happy with did not upgrade properly. i had to redo delete and redo the skills on that one did not take over lead spot that well.
124,14,"it is awesome and super easy yo use. my 6 year old daughter uses it everyday to listen to her favorite children is music and books. the sound is a perfect balance of highs and lows; something i would expect from bose. if you are on the fence about buying this, just do it, you will noy be disappointed."
125,14,she always knows what time it is trained in my voice if i speak loud enough. needs fine-tuning that is probably already in the works e.g. understands turn off the lights does not understand turn out the lights well versed in many subjects. more later after using longer time
126,7,i love everything about alexa!
127,4,it was a gift for my daughter-in-law from my son. she loved it.
128,14,"so far, this device lives up to the hype!!! i am a electronic technician, and electronic specialist, when you buy electronics, the company like amazon is will offer a warranty, that is not to waist your money, that is to save you money, if you buy anything electronic more than $10, i would strongly advise you to buy the warranty, i am more than qualified to give this advice, i used to build electronics for a living!!! when i bought this product, i even purchased the warranty!!! god bless you, and please take my advice!"
129,6,great product. would buy again
130,7,really neat item. the sound is really nice.
131,14,"i was under the impression that this would unlock my adt pulse kwikset locks, raise my garage door and all the features except for cameras operate, it does not i see that i need to get echo plus, echo shoe and about 3 echo spots. bought eight of these now i have to return and get the proper echoes, the video for this device is misleading."
132,14,"what is the coolest about alexa (echo) is her prime feature is access to all internet information, plus what we share with her and everything in our devices. so she quickly became a family member that is always focused on our needs and ready to fill them. whenever we know need something, alexa adds it to our shopping list, including giving us amazon buying options and placing orders we approve. alexa keeps our calendar, reminding us to call, pick someone up, get ready for a scheduled call coming in, or wakes us up by calling out name or playing the song we requested at the volume we asked. when we ask, she gives us our shopping list by text or orally. she makes phone calls and texts, pulls up programs we want to watch and whatever music through her formidable room-filling speakers.she is even a good therapist. tells us jokes when we need a little fun. quotes any famous person we can think of. plays any music we have asked so far. gives us meal suggestions and even their recipes!her capacity, alexa is 'engine' is not in our unit. so, as amazon expands her hardware and software- her ability to improve our lives- we do not pay for upgrades. they just surface. alexa is like a child growing up and always able to do more. with coming self-driving cars, she will likely even be able to bring a vehicle to our steps, take the kids to school, us to work or out for evening.she just keeps getting more valuable."
133,4,this was a gift for my daughter.  we absolutely love it.  great purchase.
134,7,so cool!
135,14,it is amazing step up for me from the echo dot to the new echo 2nd gen is amazing! speakers are great! duno why people are giving bad reviews about it. my option is ¡°awesome¡± :))
136,4,this is one
137,7,amazing sound!
138,4,this was a christmas gift for our daughter.  she was thrilled!!  she is 14 and always has music playing.  speaker on it is really good and she loves being able to use it as an alarm clock.
139,6,overall the echo and dot are welcomed addititions to our home. although i was a bit suprised that texting capability with family members is only currently supports android phones. hopefully the developers resolve this limitation.
140,4,my husband and daughter loves this device they use it everyday
141,7,this product met all my expectations
142,7,oh my god its so amazing! i love it!
143,7,i¡¯m very pleased with my echo and i¡¯m learning more cool things on how to use it all the time!!!
144,7,this is my first relationship with alexa so i have nothing to compare it with.  i use her primarily to play music. very nice sound.
145,7,"bought as a gift, but love the echo"
146,14,i like alexa now i do not forget things at the grocery store.
147,6,i love my echo.....the fabric was great really matched my grey sofa well
148,14,i have a lot of echo is....i think i need help.
149,7,i love my echo!  it is easy to set up. the sound is great. best purchase ever.
150,7,playing music.
151,14,"let me count the ways...she turns on and off our christmas lights, sets our alarms, reminders, schedules, to-dos, plays our favorite music and even reads to us.the only way she could get any better is if she had her own plugs and switches. its coming, alexa. its coming!<f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0089>seriously though, if you have thought about creating a smart home i encourage you to buy one and give it a go. we started with one. we ordered the echo dot, plugged it in for about 10 minutes, fell in love with it, and ordered one echo tower for dining room, master bedroom and my son is room. all the other rooms in the house have dots. my office has dots. my car has a dot. it just really allows us to use technology to our advantage!"
152,14,amazing device with excellent sound and functionality. we keep discovering more.
153,14,"it does wait you want it to do sometimes but i still find,myself using the google because she can not find the answer or its wrong. would i purchase again, probably not."
154,14,product is just used for music and weather and it couldnt be better...ease of use is exactly why we bought it
155,14,it does things on its own at random. like providing the weather report in the middle of playing music without you requesting it. it also is not good at guessing what music you request unless you know the exact song title and artist and sometimes you have to say the artist first and then the title instead of just being attentive. not super impressed so far. worst is that having signed up for amazon music unilited thinking this would be the most integrated service was a total fail. forget requesting songs unless you¡¯re alone. during a dinner party all eight of us tried the same artist and sing with no success and the day before it worked fine so i know it had it in the library. just searching for a song when this happens is not available. also ask yourself. how many times do you know the artist and the song title of something you wanna hear? for me it is close to never. so the guessing/screaming alexa game is never ending.
156,7,"great device and easy to setup, i still have not used a quarter of its capabilities yet. i am still learning about all of its capabilities. so far so good!"
157,7,very good and easy to use
158,14,amazing! my grandchildren liked it so much. they enjoyed listening to alexa. thank you and more power!
159,6,"useful, almost has a personality.  tone, especially mid to high range, not great, lot of bass."
160,7,who knew that we needed alexis?  almost as good as having a butler. the echo was easy to set up even for us non tech people. we are still learning all things the echo can do.
161,7,"we just hooked up our alexa two days ago and we are having fun already.  we are just learning what all we can ask alexa, but she is already becoming a family member.  ha ha  we have gotten interesting information from her, asked stupid questions, been told jokes, gotten the weather report, our schedule, sports scores, started a grocery list.  we love her already.  now....what to buy her for christmas??  i think a thermostat to go with her - that will be nice."
162,4,"this was a gift for my fiancee, everyone loves it. he uses it as an alarm in the morning, to find different  songs he likes, and the grandkids think it is  funny when they ask it to fart.  it is loved by all."
163,4,seamless integration
164,14,my family and i are enjoying our echo! the kids enjoy the jokes and games in which they can play! i love the word of the day as well as they daily questions! such fun!
165,7,great product
166,4,gave as christmas gift they love it
167,14,"i have the google home and comparing this to that.. the echo is terrible. when asked certain questions.. the echo does not know how to answer it, whereas the google home always knows the answer to everything."
168,7,great speakers!
169,14,"great, all good, thank you."
170,14,it is great!!!! my wish is its command. has not let me down so far. excellent best gift i received.
171,14,i like the first generation better than i do this one.  this one is hard to give commands to since i get no reaction sometimes when i tell it to do something.  most time it hesitates before doing what i asked it to do.  thinking about returning it.
172,7,very impressed. does a lot more than i thought it did. have a lot of fun playing kid games with my grandkids.
173,14,this is awesome perfect
174,7,what a great innovation.  i love the functions and music.
175,14,music was fairly clear and strong. alexa was fun to work with. however i also bought a ¡°dot¡± but was not able to sync both to play the same music at the same time.
176,4,parents love it for their house and store!
177,6,better sound quality than mu echo dot.
178,6,this is the best thing since sliced bread. it is even better than i expected.
179,7,it does answer any of my question. it could not even do military time...
180,7,it was easy to setup and easy to use.but it takes some practice to know what how to ask alexa questions.
181,14,most disappointed that there is no portable power source for gen 2.
182,7,"she is weird.  i like the device, but it gives me the creeps sometimes.  we do have many smart bulbs, so that is what we primarily use it for.  that and for basic information."
183,7,got it for my wife for the kitchen. she is still learning to use it but loves what she can do with it already. i have rwo echo dots already and she wanted one too.
184,14,i have only had this for a few weeks now and still getting to know all the features.  a super vast improvement over the older versions that could not answer any questions.  sound quality is good but not great ( much better than the dots).
185,14,we do not use it much but everytime our grandkids come over it is going constantly!
186,7,i love my echo!
187,7,"great sound, actually amazing sound....still trying to figure out what music company i want to go with, (though you do not need one for just basic music). great for reminders and daily weather!"
188,7,i love alexa. trying to connect to sirius xm has not been succesful
189,7,i love everything about it.
190,6,not only informative and helpful but a lot of fun in idle moments.
191,7,i love it!!  love it!!
192,7,"start the day with alexa, weather report, classical music"
193,7,i love the music and timer.
194,7,great speaker
195,7,"i love the music and the quirky things alexa,says."
196,7,great sound!
197,4,absolutely loved it!!
198,7,everything as expected. i love it.
199,6,sounds really goooooouuuuda for a small tube
200,6,ok overall
201,7,met all expectations
202,6,sound is greatly improved over the original echo.
203,7,just love it!
204,6,"sound is great very crisp and clear. also very powerful, i love it."
205,7,"sound quality is great, and she can hear you really well."
206,7,i can not sy much. still experimenting with it.
207,14,the 2nd generations are amazing!! i bought three to utilize the whole home audio and they sound much better than the 1st gen model. can not wait to add more and buy interchangeable shells!!! great job amazon you never disappoint
208,7,awesome. love alexa!
209,6,"sound is decent at best.  i put it in a 14x14 room and when turned up, it is distorted.  i would not recommend.  the echo plus is better."
210,7,perfect assistant
211,14,"i love my echo! easy to set up and i have not had any issues with it whatsoever. only down side is having to keep it plugged in all the time. going to purchase the dot soon, so i do not have to move my echo around the house so much."
212,7,i love listening to npr and making grocery lists! my son and i have fun with animal sounds and nursery rhymes too!
213,7,i love the easy access to my favorite music. the sound is great.
214,14,i purchased an alexa 1st generation after receiving an. echo for a christmas gift. it was a very expensive. i trusted the sound quality would be very good. it is not. very poor instead. my clock radio sounds better. very frustrated and disappointed. buyer beware of gen 1.
215,14,my son got this for me for christmas. at first was not sure i would use it so much. i use it all the time. love this.
216,14,"love our echo.  the speaker has been more impressive than we would have expected.  we have had to unplug and re-plug a couple of times because it becomes detached from our connection but it is easy and works again quickly.  we have automated a large number of lights, fan, thermostat and using alexa to control it has been amazing."
217,7,it is all it was advertised to do and so much more. i use it way more than i thought i would.
218,7,very handy device.  it can do much to simplify controlling information around the home.  still have much to discover and explore
219,7,excelent speaker
220,14,it would not connect to wifi so i returned it after speaking to customer support.
221,7,i love being able to verbually ask alexa anything and she gets me the answer quickly.
222,14,"we have two echos, one for the living room and the other in the bedroom. we mostly listen to npr news and music from various radio stations. we enjoy having them."
223,14,"received this as a christmas gift. i would never have purchased one myself. i love the music i can listen to, other than that, it is useless for us. maybe if we had more smart home features? maybe i just am missing something?"
224,0,it is a great device.  my hugging l husband ordered it but i use it most.  easy set up and use.  <f0><u+009f><u+0092><u+009c>
225,7,great to have around the house
226,14,enough said.
227,14,it would be better if there was a way to delete multiple cards
228,14,the bass is not good. it was a good product at $79 but not at $100. i would never in a million years purchase this thing for the current price. wait until it goes back down. i think that the original one had much better sound.
229,7,love it
230,14,this was an impulse purchase but i am glad i did it.  i used to play pandora on my smart tv.  no longer.  the speaker is as good as the tv is.  i just wish my kids had one of these so i could contact them.  continually learning new features
231,4,has really changed how we organize our household. great product. our three children love it.
232,7,echo is great. keeps me company. i live alone.i may purchase another one.
233,14,new 'stuff' all the time.
234,14,"i enjoy this so much.  after a long busy night at work, i come home and say alexa playing soothing music. i am very happy with this product"
235,6,love the interface with sirius radio. good sound quality for price.  software a little quirky for some commands.  would buy again.
236,7,love it!  the sound is amazing!!
237,7,alexa is amazing we are getting fun...
238,4,my wife loved her echo.  best present i ever gave her!
239,14,the amazon echo works great with my other echo and echo dot products i have installed in my house.  i also use tp-link products with them and it controls my sony tv.  try to get them when amazon has discount sales on them for extra savings for your smart home.
240,6,works great
241,7,i get music i want all the time
242,14,awesome product!!! nothing negative to say.
243,4,love it!
244,14,this is a great tool to use for various tasks.
245,7,not happy with it at all everything we ask her she says she does not know. very unhappy that we spent money on this.
246,7,to hard to connect. it is no where easy like on tv!!! a piece of _____!!!!!!
247,14,"it is great for quick info and playing light music in the background. sound wise it will not be replacing my bose bluetooth speaker, it does not come close to that type of quality. but given the price point and versatility it is very good."
248,14,this thing is a piece of crap. constantly trying to reconnect and wont turn on. totally not worth the time or money.
249,7,not really sure still learning how to use it so far it is working good
250,7,my wife and i love all the features that it has and also the music request is always acceptable to our needs.
251,7,love it! very helpful in so many ways.
252,4,best family purchase ever!!
253,4,"i got this for my annoying 8 yr old who asks too many questions. alexa plays his favorite songs, spells out words for him, does his math homework, and tells him corny jokes. best investment ever!"
254,6,"had the first generation echo and it was good, ordered the new second generation and it is even better. shorter and wider design and better sound speaker."
255,7,"we love playing our favorite music, obtaining our calendar schedules, and getting all sorts of information just by asking."
256,14,i love it .. it was on time and totally recommend people to buy this
257,7,quick delivery!! works great! use it all the time!! thanks
258,14,"this space is not large enough to say all the great things about the echo second generation. i am discovering new things to use it for on a daily basis from setting a timer to steep my tea, getting up to date news and weather, the latest sports scores, controlling various devices around the house and many other things. five stars are not enough to rate this extremely useful product. i highly recommend to all. i will be buying several echo dots for use at home. the heather gray model blends in with every thing in my living room."
259,7,"easy to install,  great sound quality and fun."
260,14,"when i first booted it up, i tried to see if the sound was as bad as people made it out to be but it was fine. it then updated to the 420 update that some people got to fix the sound issue. now the problem is, when i ask it to play music, it¡¯ll identify the song bu then take a couple seconds to actually play it then two seconds later, it will pause and then tell me something went wrong. the song is ¡°time stand still¡± by rush if that helps at all. man amazon, you really dropped the ball on this one...update: the issue i detailed above was actually widepsread for alot of amu subscribers and is now fixed. i am now experiencing an issue with the ambient noise function where it wont switch to the noise i want. i will ask it ti play rain, it will play it and then when i ask to play thunderstorm or any other ambient noise, it will listen to me and just resume the current ambient noise. the alexa app tells me that its playing what i want, but the echo itself is still playing the current noise i want to get out of."
261,7,somewhat disappointed.  i expected a far better quality sound as compared to the original echo. that just did not happen.
262,6,echo has great sounds speakers.
263,6,works very good in the house and would recommend it to anyone!
264,7,not as nice as echo show but sound is great and very happy wih performance
265,14,i love it mainly for music and during cooking. there are quite a few times it does not even know what you¡¯re saying and sometimes can not even find a popular song. but it has cool features and keeps the kids entertained so it gets 4 stars.
266,7,does not know the answers or have information about current or forthcoming events such as dates where ncaa basket ball tournaments will be held.
267,14,it is not working so well each time a i get a email to my tablet that are connected to echo it stop it function and i have to start asking again for music or any other task echo is doingvery bad
268,14,i like it - i have an older echo in the other room. i put this one in my bedroom and use it for my wake up alarm and to play music.the sound is very good quality when playing music
269,7,"was a gift,  seems to like it alot though."
270,7,it do whatever you ask.
271,7,"i love it. i am still learning to use her, but having fun doing it. my grand kids love asking alexa questions."
272,14,nowhere near as good as the 1st generation.
273,7,hard to program for a novice!
274,7,i love my alexa she is great
275,4,we bought 3 echos.  one was for ourselves and the others are christmas presents for our children.  we love alexa!
276,7,the sound.....it was amazing for the money!  love that you can ask it anything and the answer is ready!!!
277,7,alex is my favorite device and even sounds better now!
278,7,exceeds my expectations
279,7,works great
280,14,"overall i am happy with this purchase.  this is not our first echo and i was very concerned with a lot of the reviews indicating the sound quality on the 2nd generation was bad.  when i got this echo set up and started playing music, the reviews were correct about the sound.  however, about the 3rd song in, the echo announced it received an important update and needed to restart.  after the restart completed it was a night and day difference in sound quality and was much better.  the reason i gave this 4 stars is because when i listen to the same song side by side on 1st and 2nd generation, the bass in the 1st generation echo still sounds better.  i am not saying the 2nd generation sounds bad, but amazon advertises this as having improved sound and i do not agree.  i really like some of the features the echo has if you own multiple echo is such as playing music on all your connected echo is and the drop in feature.  i would still recommend this product and not be concerned about the sound."
281,7,this is the greatest. so far so good
282,14,i currently have many different echos and this by far is the worst. i am not sure if i got a lemon and need to return but his echo never complete request. need help
283,7,its goood
284,7,great! very entertaining. loads of music. great for turning on and off lights. plan to use it alot.
285,7,sound quality is wonderful! so easy to listen to music anywhere in the house now. and it is so much fun to ask alexa random questions to see how she will answer!
286,14,"got this for my father-in-law for christmas - he is a gadget freak, even at the age of 80, so i thought this would be the perfect gift - and it was!!  he is been playing and experimenting with it all week, having fun just figuring out what it can do!!  i could not have asked for a better gift for him - well worth the full price!!"
287,14,"there is a short learning curve interacting with alexa.  skills that you can add are many, but few add any real value that i can discern at this time.  also, when you use the echo to turn on another speaker, it would be nice if it could play on the echo as well, especially since you are connected via wifi.  still exploring it is functionality, and can see the potential should minor updates improve on a pretty cool product."
288,14,awesome sound from a little speaker. this is a room filling sound do not get me wrong. the skills are great i use some to help me sleep and then to find information i need to know. very easy to set up. you can buy more than one or add the dot to other rooms and you can connect them together and have music playing all over the house no need for any expensive stereo systems or big bulky speakers. i would recommend it to anyone.
289,7,still trying to figure how to use it.
290,4,"was a gift, he loves it"
291,14,"i love it. do not listen over a 7 volume, but it is really good quality sound for a decent size room. i love how it can pick my voice up across my apartment. i am still learning all of it is features but so far its great."
292,14,looks better and cheaper price than 1st gen. it sounds the same as the previous model. great buy.
293,14,"we were given one around christmas. and really do not understand the point of it. i am pretty tech savvy and know i can hook it up to light switches, etc. but we barely use it now. we will tell it to put music on every now and then and that is about it.nwastrbof money imo."
294,7,love it!
295,7,"absolutely amazing! i never thought i would jump on the ¡°smart home¡± trend, but i honestly do not know what i would do without alexa every single day."
296,7,what a terrific product.  i now enjoy it every day.
297,4,absolutely love it
298,14,"doesnt get much use at my home, but when i need something, it can tell me whatever i need to know."
299,14,have not even used it yet. i¡¯ve just opened my package to find no power cord included. very disappointed!edit: was shipped a charger free of charge and it arrive 1 days later! loving my new echo.
300,7,it is all right but you can live without it
301,7,echo and alexa are a great combosound is acceptableeasy to set up and easy to use
302,14,"for some reason the response time on my new echo is much slower, than on my previous one, but the price, size and most importantly the sound quality are a huge improvement.alexa still struggles to play my own playlists and get the right music from my music library, and playing a whole album instead of just the song if the album and a song on it with the same title as the album, but it is getting better.it is certainly worth having especially if you are a prime member. and even better if you have amazon music."
303,14,"this was actually an item i won from work (i work at an amazon fc) and i must say, it is great sound quality for it is size. great for situations where i want to listen to music but my hands are tied."
304,7,does it do anything at all without being programmed?
305,7,great product! love being able to listen to the radio on iheartradio on my days off.
306,7,i love this unit. i got as a gift but far exceeds my expectations.
307,7,great sound.
308,14,awesome! definitely recommend
309,6,love it. works great with 2gig alarm and home automation system. recommended.
310,6,works ok with some of the wifi lighting modules specifically idevice but was hard to set up with a mac
311,14,"does what i wanted.  however, looking at next weeks black friday advertisements, i kinda feel bad because it will be $20cheaper next week, i should have waited and you should too"
312,7,love this!!!!! and so easy to set up.  we are having a blast listening to old music from high school and turning on and off lights.  very helpful when you have a quick question especially when you are cooking and need a conversion done.
313,7,"i have had echo for about a week & love it! so much alexa does, i am still learning!"
314,14,one of the best things that i purchased.
315,7,love it
316,14,i use echo with my 4 wemo smart plugins and it works great most of the time. sometimes i have to tell alexa a couple of times to operate devices.
317,14,"even though i am the ultimate tech geek and tend to buy whatever the latest in consumer electronics, i have been skeptical about the amazon echo ever since it was released. why buy one of these when you have your well-established siri, cortana, and google assistant -- which have been around for years. moreover, why should i complicate my life with yet another set of unique communication protocols?well, when i was offered a substantial discount through audible, i decided to give echo a try.with the first couple hours of interacting with alexa, i had my epiphany. alexa trumps the other interactive technologies in big audacious ways:1) the fact that it is always on and listening makes a huge difference. no buttons need to be pressed. yes, you might say that you can do that with siri. but there is a huge difference. where it trumps ""hey siri"" is its listening technology when enables to me to say ""alexa"" from across the room, when music is playing, in the same way i would call out the name of someone in my family. believe me...this makes a huge difference in the user experience.moreover, siri is impatient and often misinterprets what you are saying. alexa is right on the money i would say around 90% of the time.2) the skills that come standard are pretty much in line with what the other voice assistants have. and...while there are a lot useless 3rd party skills, if you do your homework, you will find some solid gems by browsing for ""best skills lists have been compiled by various websites.""3) if you love music, you are in for a treat. the speaker is awesome, given the size of this cylinder. initially, i paired it with a humongous bluetooth speaker i own. however, now i mostly use the echo is built-in speaker. the sound is easily within the realm of ""dedicated mid-sized bluetooth speakers"" that amazon sells that you would pay $150 bucks. i love edm, jazz, and metal, but the true measure of how great the speaker is that i also enjoy listening to classical on it as well.moreover, the kicker is that you just say, ""alexa play some bach choral music,"" and she plays it using the music service of your choice. you do not have to open your phone and dig through playlists. the music just plays.if you are wondering if this device is for you, i would say you are coming in at a good time. the echo is in his 2nd generation. initial bugs are squashed, and the sound is great.this is is one of the greatest things i have purchased in 2017."
318,4,censors the hell out of song titles as light as wang dang sweet poontang by ted nugent.great for not having to look up the weather.
319,7,"same alexa, i love but better soundingme:- what can i do for you alexa?alexa:- great! , i have an assistant nowclassic"
320,7,"love my alexa, the sound quality exceeds what i was hoping for. great purchase!"
321,7,"can not download my music from my pc to echo.  must ask the question in format that echo understands, pain"
322,14,"i thought i would be the one getting the most use out of this, but my wife and daughter will sit and ask it questions for hours.  it is a lot of fun for them.  i will say that i put off getting an echo because i was skeptical about how well it would sound.  when they say it fills the room, it does exactly that.  i was amazed.  i am quite pleased with the device."
323,7,i love that it is so easy to set up and to use. easiest access to all music and so much more.
324,14,will not stay on or connected to wifi.
325,6,"the sound quality is disappointing.  i thought it would be more robust.  otherwise, it is a good product."
326,7,i love it.
327,14,"we have four 1st gen echos at home, one 1st gen at our offices, and now four 2nd gen also at the offices.  awesome.  they understand us, are reliable, and work well with two different automation systems (different ones at home and office).  i have even purchased one for an elderly friend, who also loves it."
328,7,love this device
329,7,"the tech (shelly) was great.  she sure knows her jobs.  love the echo.  we are very pleased with the product, the job shelly did, and what all it does"
330,6,"alexa and i have become best friends.  the sound quality is more than adequate.  we had a new year is eve party and needed music in our two-car garage, the echo was a more than adequate sound system for the evening."
331,14,not enough included with prime for echo had to buy extra package love music but felt add on should have been cheaper
332,7,this is my first echo and i love it.
333,7,"love my alexa.....how i lived without it, i do not know...."
334,14,loved the call and music play features.
335,14,great product!!!!
336,14,have enjoyed the echo so much i bought one for each of my family members.
337,7,it is hard to imagine my life without my echo dot and my echo. i use them multiple times everyday.  the heather grey echo is beautiful and works perfectly.  it really looks like a designer piece on my nightstand. i am going to give my friend a white echo dot for her baby shower to use in her nursery.  i am sure she will love the sleep timer and the hands free ability to play a lullaby or nature noises.........
338,6,"love the new design and the sound improvement is a total winner. all the more reason to put one in every room (over time, obviously). the only thing i prefer from original echo and dot models is the rotating volume wheel. otherwise, this new model goes perfectly in our house with the more-stylish finish."
339,14,"the promise of the echo (or better yet 3 of them) dies quickly in an actual family. you cannot provide voice profiles to your teens in your household, so they cannot listen to their own music, let alone your kids. just you and one other adult? if you want to use this for a family and actually manage it for a family, good luck.update: product support contacted me and indeed this ecosystem is not mature for a family at all. stay away. too bad we do not have the boxes anymore or i would return these."
340,7,"love being able to trim lights, etc on or off without lifting a finger. also love the different color lights"
341,14,"i love my echo! i always had the tv on so i could listen to pandora but now i just tell alexa what i want to here and what channel.  i want one upstairs.  she is so convenient. i can tell her to pause, to play whatever station,  tell me a joke,  what is the weather, how to spell a word. she is awesome.  i love that i do not have to get up and turn the volume up or down when the phone rings or when a song is louder than the one before etc. being disabled, or even if i were not,  i would totally recommend the echo.  i love it!"
342,7,"almost perfect.  does not always respond, when prompted but still a lot of fun!"
343,14,"the sound is incredible, fast responses, and it can hear your voice in with other noise going on"
344,7,first time owning a smart speaker it is very interesting how it works. i still have to learn a little bit more very cool.
345,14,just great to be able to listen to whatever you¡¯re in the mood for with a simple voice direction.
346,4,i was a gift to my wife.  she loves alexa! alexa reminds my wife when to take her meds and plays her some of her favorite music. every morning alexa tells her a joke and most importantly recently told my wife the eagles were going to win the super bowl!
347,7,"you can ask alexa,just about anything and she will give u the facts"
348,7,we love our echo and use it all of the time.
349,14,"about two months into ownership my echo discontinued accepting verbal commands. this is very disappointing. up to that point, it worked fine. i expected this electronic device to work for longer than two months."
350,7,very cool
351,14,"i love mine, speaker is loud enough for intense move, clarity and sounds are perfect for what you pay for.mine is next to my bed, alexa plays to my command. i purchase mine from a friend."
352,6,great product overall!!!!works great ..
353,14,"received on time, as expected"
354,14,"hi, i¡¯m glad that i upgraded my echo to the 2nd generation. not only did it come in a smaller form, but the sound was much better too! <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+008a>"
355,14,"it cannot say dinah... it will do a command several days in a row then totally misunderstand it for the next 10 days.  as long as you do not expect it to work or understand you....you¡¯ll love it.  yeah, right"
356,7,i liked the easy set up and the range of questions alexa answers. i dislike that alexa sometimes does not understand music selection in non english titles.
357,6,"i feel the original echo was loader and sounded better. the echo dot is worse the the 2nd generation echo. my recommendation would be to buy a used echo,"
358,7,loving it!
359,7,"so sorry it took us so long to get the echo.  we love it!  i got it as a gift for my husband, but i work from home and use it all the time."
360,14,"sounds great , works great. upgrade from an echo dot. now they both work in conjunction. bought my first fire tablet way back before there was an alexa. since then have bought a firestick, a dot, an echo, and three other fire tablets. everything is still working. bought two kids tablets, they are easily the best kids tablet around, and come with 2 year guarantee. highly suggest the echo, it does so many things, and is full of so much knowledge. easy 5 stars.can you live without this? sure but it makes life more fun with it."
361,0,<u+2764><u+fe0f><u+2764><u+fe0f><u+2764><u+fe0f><u+2764><u+fe0f><u+2764><u+fe0f><u+2764><u+fe0f><u+2764><u+fe0f><u+2764><u+fe0f><u+2764><u+fe0f><u+2764><u+fe0f>
362,7,"alexa is not intuitive. i get many wrong answers and i often get ""i do not know that"". it is very frustrating. a simple question like ""where is the lincoln center located?"" gets a wrong answer. all she could find was lincoln city. i am not happy with it."
363,7,we love our alexa and use it daily.
364,4,love my new echo
365,7,"i love mine, does everything as advertised. fun"
366,14,"not smart at all. if i tell alexa to stop, that is it. cannot understand compound instructions at all."" alexa stop and goodnite"" is too complicated for alexa. ask for the temp. only dodesnt work either."
367,14,extremely satisfied with sound quality and ease of use. want to purchase an echo dot and remote speaker soon.
368,7,i love it !!!!!!!! it my sleep timer as well as my alarm and i get information from it all the time.
369,0,i love my alexa echo. i am able to do everything from learn the weather for today to practice a foreign language!! easy to use<f0><u+009f><u+008e><u+0089><f0><u+009f><u+008e><u+0089><f0><u+009f><u+008e><u+0089>
370,14,"my amazon alexa echo arrived the other day and after connecting it to my amazon account along with my wifi i have been really enjoying listening to music on command and the sound is fantastic for it is size. alexa can answer so many questions that i have been asking, i would definitely recommend one to anyone who is interested in getting one. there is nothing that do not like about my alexa."
371,14,easy to setup and operate. great sound for the price point.
372,7,she is so smart she scares me.  she has only been wrong once about the weather.
373,7,love it!
374,14,"i absolutely love it. i do not know what else to say. this is one of the coolest christmas gifts i have ever received. since receiving this i have purchased another one and 2.echoes. they are placed strategically around the house so i can always talk to alexa, listen to music or ask questions."
375,7,this device exceeded my expectations.  this is the wave of future.  it is a must have in every household.  very pleased i purchased echo.
376,4,i love it !
377,14,i started with the dot and upgraded to this.  i love it!!  i am glad i got the 2nd generation.  i know that i dont use the echo to its full capacity; there is so much it can do.  i do have my lights connected to it though and it makes things so much easier.  this is what you need in your house. you will not be disappointed.
378,14,"i was a little hesitant to order the new generation.  there seemed to be a boat load of bad reviews.  but i am glad i did.  most of the bad reviews were based on poor sound quality, which software upgrades have totally taken care of.  i am actually amazed at the sound quality.  nice low-end without the boomy bose nonsense, and fairly crisp highs.  is it studio monitor quality? not even close.  but for the size, it is pretty darn good."
379,7,i love my alexa!
380,14,had it for 1 day now it does not work. sending it back
381,14,"bought this so i could access pandora.  it does that and much more.  it is a stereo the size of a tall soup can.  surprisingly strong speaker too.  not tinny, really great volume."
382,6,the sound is phenomenal and crystal clear!
383,7,she is not as smart as i expected..
384,7,"disappointed that even though we have prime, we still are very limited in her music selection"
385,6,ok but not very useful
386,7,"love it. i had to change its name from alexa to echo. it drove us crazy everytine we would talk to our granddaughter, alexa. love the amazon music collection too."
387,14,it sometimes does not respond and you need to have very specific questions. the jokes are and news updates are excellent
388,7,"very happy so far.  music sound is much better than expected.  easy to setup, and to connect to a bluetooth sound bar as well.  still learning all of the features but works great so far.only downside is i wish amazon would have included a hard copy of explanation of what the different color rings mean."
389,14,awesome
390,14,great device. slightly more compact than the original echo and looks fantastic. it also has really good sound for its size and produces amazing bass. was really easy to set up from the alexa app and i now have it grouped together with the echo dot to play music simultaneously through both.
391,7,works great!
392,14,"pros:it is small (more compact than i was expecting)alexa works great! (same as the echo dot) she is basically my new best friend!they are adding more and more things every day to what she is capable of doingreally love using it with smart home devices (christmas tree lights, lamps, thermostat, patio light etc)saves me so much time (alexa set an alarm, whats the weather, wake me up, tell me the news, i ask what time it is 10xs a day)cons:only 1. i was using a dot and had it connected to my big jam box via bluetooth but if i did not use it all day i would find that the connection would unpair every day by the end of the night, this annoyed the living crap out of me so that is why i bought the echo as it has it is own speaker.  the dot alone i could never hear but thats the model that roped me in so to say.  so the big negative of the echo is that the speaker really plain ol just stinks. my big jam box is just a tad bit bigger but wow the difference in the quality and richness of the audio is night and day difference. my suggestion to amazon is to add another version of the echo, call it the echo pro or echo audiophile. i would pay $100 more for a better and louder speaker. if you are not that into music it might not bother you too much, but for me, who has a big jam box in 1 room and a bose in another room, this just sounds pitiful in comparison. it distorts at level 10, level 9 is not the max level that i would like a speaker to have.  there is zero bass, too much mids, and not enough treble surprisingly enough. you can really clearly tell that the speaker just does not cut it, i do not think people would mind a larger unit if that meant a more enjoyable higher end user experience. like i said if giving it a bigger better sound adds to the price-point, then i would not mind laying down a little more dough for the model up version. i can see people enjoying this model just fine also as long as their expectations in sound quality are so high.conclusion:it is a great little device but it needs to have a bigger speaker that is more powerful with a bold rich sound to it, fix that and i would think that every person on the planet should have one of these.note: this is my opinion and based off of having already upgraded to the latest firmware sound fix. i will upgrade my stars should it ever get near the quality of my big jambox or bose."
393,14,fun interactive speaker. pretty good quality when using as a speaker for the cell phone. will order a second one for myself as i gave for a gift and the family has loved it.
394,7,beautiful to look at and listen to. i wish i could access my synology server to listen to my own music.
395,6,great sound! useful and entertaining.
396,7,i love her
397,7,great audio..........needs more info about movie theme songs etc. etc......
398,7,i liked how easy it is just talk. i do not like that i can not get some radio stations.
399,7,"i am still learning a lot on what alexa can do, but it is a great speaker as well."
400,7,we love it.
401,14,i can not believe all that sound comes from this
402,7,"easy to set up, volumn and all the functions of alexa from reminders to music.like least :  in another room and mention ¡®alexa ¡® name and she¡¯ll answer.  kinda creepy!"
403,7,we love our echo. set up was easy and took no time. we specially like the drop in feature and we use it every day.
404,7,very pleased with this purchase
405,7,i am really enjoying the echo.  it is really helpful when making dinner and i need a quick sauce recipe or salad dressing. alexis gives me a top recipe quickly.
406,14,awesome!
407,14,more and better speakers as addition to echo dot.
408,7,"has a very good speaker, sounds great. makes getting the news and music you want to listen to simple."
409,7,she loved it.  the sound is great
410,14,"the directions for this sophisticated and complicated device are abominable. but, the real issue is why. the echo at this price should be self-starting and able to connect to any wifi automatically. i would urge people who are not nerds and computer gurus to avoid this product. amazon is tech team should be ashamed of itself."
411,14,i love everything about it. the sound is awesome but the size is not.to big. just bought another one for upstairs.
412,6,excellent
413,6,love the new echo
414,6,"overall all  product is ok- sound quality, size, interface good."
415,7,i love this thing!!!
416,6,great sound.
417,6,excellent sound quality. alexa could be improved however.
418,7,"awesome product. love alexa. easy to set up, some difficulty pairing other devices to it, like wemo plugs and such, but figured it out eventually. good sound quality"
419,7,i love the echo.i love that i can do so much with it.
420,14,"back in october i bit the bullet and decided to buy a gen 2 echo. not the worst $99.00 i have ever spent but it is probably 2 or 3 on my list of dumb purchases. for starters i really do not have much use for it unless i spend a pile of money on echo controlled light bulbs, outlet controllers, thermostat, and countless other things i do not need to add or replace.it really does not replace anything i already have such as a radio. so as an experiment i turned it off for a week and discovered i did not miss it. it is back on and i have not used it yet. definitely something i do not need."
421,14,it does not work very well. it often goes red and says that it can not understand us.
422,6,simple to install and the apparatus makes one feel that it is human great product
423,7,it is sooooo fun and really good speaker!
424,7,kids love it.
425,14,it is a great device. only starting to understand it is full potential.
426,6,"i love the new size of the 2nd generation model, and there is a definite improvement to the sound quality."
427,7,"got it from best buy !! love it it is very load fun setting up and control the lights, temperature and more, get free music for 30 days and pandora and more! also works really well with my tv (samsung) and dish (dish hopper)"
428,7,hesitant to review as i have not utilized it extensively. great sound for music playlists.  not a technology person.  but am enjoying the music and random questions answered.  will use more as i learn more.
429,7,"i am just scratching the surface of all this product can do... so far i like accessing my pandora account the most, while my wife seems to like to ask when the next blackhawks hockey game is going to be. these devices are distinguishing life in the 21st century from life in the 20th for sure!"
430,7,great sound
431,14,this little gem gets better and better everyday! i can not believe the quality of sound that comes out of it! must have! it absolutely rocks and i am an apple guy
432,14,"the echo would¡¯ve received a 5 star but because it can not be personalized to one person  voice it gets a 3. it would be nice if it can only recognize the owners voice, anyone who say alexia has control of the device."
433,4,given as gift.... we never wanted
434,6,"love it!! alexa is very responsive and the sound is superb, especially with music from pandora and iheart radio. the sound is full, well balanced and enough sound to fill my large famiy room."
435,14,"set up is not as intuitive as other amazon devices like the fire tv. when you power it on, alexa tells you to follow the instructions in your alexa app (on your phone). when you log into the app, there are no instructions on the main page. so, follow these instructions:- click on the menu (3 bars in the upper left hand corner).- select settings- select echo. it should say ¡°offline¡± under it.- it will tell you that you need to connect the device to wifi. when you proceed, it may try to connect you to the echo is wifi signal instead of your home wifi. if it does this, it will tell you to go to your settings and reselect your home wifi. it is annoying. if it does not do this, then just go to the next step.- whether you have to do the above step or not, you will then select ¡°update wifi¡±- click ¡°connect to wifi.¡± you should see the orange light ring around the top. if you do not, unplug it and plug it back in.- now is when you should actually connect to your echo is wifi. go to the wifi setting on your phone and select the one that starts with the word amazon. wait for it to connect and then go back to the alexa app.- it should now say ¡°connected to echo¡±. click continue.- select your home wifi account on the next screen.- it may take a second or two, but eventually it will say setup complete. click continue. it will take you back to the main page and you are ready to use your echo.regarding the sound, it is true that it is not quite as good as the original. however, it is light years better than the dot. also, this unit is $70 cheaper than the original echo. so, i¡¯m not sure what people were expecting for $99. is it worth that? yes. it is. it is not bose. if you want bose, cough up the other $400.edited to add (for the audiophiles): i do not actually think bose is all that excellent, but i needed a name people would recognize.what i will say, is that you should buy this version and save yourself the money over the plus version. the ¡°built in smart hub¡± is nothing more than a bunch of enabled skills. and, the skills that are being pushed by the plus are for products that has disappointing reviews and high prices. it is also a limited list of 2 pages of items, of which the more reasonably priced ones have mediocre reviews. save yourself the money and figure out how to enable the skills on this version. you can end up with the same results."
436,14,"what a cool device.  the sound goes through the house like old school speakers.  wish it could automatically connect to slacker. until then, i just play slacker on another and bluetooth the sound to echo."
437,7,alexa & our family are still getting to know eachother. i am pleased with the results thus far. purchasing app is to increase her capabilities is a downside. however we have found several that do not require a subscription! she keeps my lists and set is several reminders for me. music was a must for me personally. sadly it requires a paid subscription. still as far as home assistant she is top notch! esp when she finds my phone! thanks alexa!
438,4,got this for my mom & sister. my mom thinks alexa is her new dj friend who plays any song or artist she wants. just to hear her argue with alexa is the funniest thing. best purchase ever!
439,14,"it can hear us so clearly, it is almost unsettling! i do not have to shout over the music when i want it to lower the volume. we mostly use it for music and weather updates since we really have not taken the time to discover all the functions. although, it did once tell a joke that absolutely made no sense. still working out how it works. best sound quality i have heard in a while!"
440,14,"the echo is amazing.  first of all, it is a terrific bluetooth speaker.  the sound easily fills my medium size living room.  it has an audio output plug, so i can play it thru my stereo if i want to.  then there is the idea of having a companion who can answer questions, schedule my appointments, add items to my shopping list, etc.  i am sure alexa has many ""skills"" that i have not discovered or mastered yet.  i am very excited to have an echo in the house!"
441,7,i love it
442,14,"i did not purchase this from amazon because i had a gift card from another merchant, however i love...love....love it. i wished that i could have purchased a couple for friends but they do not have wifi."
443,14,"we love the echo.  i have purchased a few already, including dots.  they provide us with answers to questions, music, and we are able to sync other smart items with them."
444,7,fun... still  learning about it
445,7,it was a gift and i love it
446,7,i love it. great sound.
447,7,really enjoying this in our home!!! have since found that i can set it to listen to lds general conference talks and to lds library - even to read the bible and  the book of mormon! wow
448,4,well received as a christmas present.
449,7,ease of set up  all of the information that you can obtain and playing music via spotify is so easy
450,4,my kids love it
451,7,that i can ask alexa to play pandora radio stations for me and that i can voice control my thermostat.
452,4,the best!!!! love it!!!
453,7,great
454,6,sounds it good n crisp but for that price range i would of liked a more portable speaker. i like the design but what i didnt like is there is a rubber peice that blocks the aux port and i find it kinda hard plugging in a aux cord in becuase of it. that rubber peice is not nesscary to be there.
455,7,genius...
456,4,great
457,7,every time you ask this thing a question it goes ¡°i¡¯m sorry i do not know the answer to that one¡±
458,7,very helpful.  fun to use. sounds great.
459,7,great sound! works great.
460,14,"love the sound quality, can not always get alexa to understand ¡°ambient noise, distant thunderstorm sounds.takes me 5 or 6 trys"
461,7,"easy to set up, great sound"
462,6,well priced....good sound quality....very versatile with home automation
463,7,i am loving my alexa<u+2014> just need to know more on what all she does!
464,14,it is sooo nice to be able to walk in the house and turn on my favourite music even if my hands are full.
465,14,it is fine.  nothing special and after a couple of weeks i realized i have not talked to it for a while.
466,14,"i thought that the sound quality would be bad. it is no top-end speaker,  but for something that sits on the kitchen counter and answers all of my mother is stupid questions, it is surprisingly good."
467,14,i am just getting used to it.give me a while
468,7,very useful in the kitchen for my wife when cooking.
469,7,very affordable and usable. i hope it has a better iphone app that can control it from remote.
470,14,worked as stated.
471,7,not impressed with the product.
472,7,i love asking for the temperature outside and the coming weather
473,7,works as expected; love having one in the bedroom to access just like the one in the family room.
474,7,she puts a smile on my face. she is so fast responding. love the shopping list. very convenient. added pandora and love the music selection. i have her gone most of the time i¡¯m in the house.still a lot i know she is capable of doing.at first the questions i asked she couldn¡¯ answer.
475,14,your family loves kids are doing something new every day
476,7,sound is pretty good while playing music.
477,7,awesome!  easy to setup and use!!!
478,7,so far it is great. still finding all it can do.
479,7,great product
480,4,"saw the ads... wanted to try it outworked as describedi use it tom play music, controllightsnice home assist product"
481,7,great so far!  lots of exploration yet to do.
482,14,"love my echo (2nd gen) !! i started out with a echo dot worked really well except was not as loud as i wanted for living room area, moved the dot to bedroom and volume was perfect!! so i replaced the dot in the living room with this echo (2nd gen) and its way louder then i needed !! the echo picks up on commands a lot better and you do not have to be to close to it, looking forward to getting another one very soon !!"
483,14,"as a general instrument, it is ok.i primarily bought it for the listening of music.  it is too restrictive in requesting music. i.e. request a specific song and get a sample of the song.often requesting music by a specific artist, not all songs play through to completion.in honesty, if i could return this instrument, i would return it in a heart beat. it is not what i envisioned."
484,14,so far so good...alexa has been better than google home and apple siri in my experience....
485,7,"it is nice if you have questions and can just ask alexa. do not make her mad though, she will not argue with you lol!!"
486,14,i love it!! we use it every single day!the only thing that i struggle with is having her understand my first question each time i ask. she will 100% get in the 2nd try.
487,6,works really well. picks up your voice amongst various sound volumes and always works. would recommend echo and alexa!
488,7,it is a fun thing to have !
489,7,"this is a fun piece of equipment.  however, alexa gets confused when i i want her to play music from pandora.  sometimes it works and other times not so much.  it is fun to ask questions and get answers right away."
490,7,i love alexa!
491,14,i liked everything
492,7,"love alexa, use it everyday for music, reminders & lists!"
493,4,i love it i bought it for my wife for christmas and she is in love with it also
494,14,"i love the new echo to be honest i can not tell much diferanse in sound quality , but i like the new size and the ability to change its look i have a oak shell on order i have had a echo sense they were offered by invitiaion and hase used it as a base to make my home smart."
495,7,bc i¡¯m away from home i can only use it from my hotspot. it works very well but i¡¯m sure i¡¯ll use it much more with my home wifi connection.
496,7,i like it but i have not used it to it is full potential.
497,14,"this is the smaller one but plenty loud enough, no need to spend more on the larger speaker version, you really have to buy the music package for 3.99 a month to really get any music on this thing, so i did, it is great, use it daily,"
498,14,"it always misunderstands on first command, and sometimes it starts to talk in the middle of the night, and wakes everyone up.  i turned it off."
499,7,it is a very useful and entertaining device. i just wish it would stay on when you unplug it.
500,6,great product. phenomenal sound
501,7,how easy it is to setup! it sounds fantastic !
502,7,still learning to use but love it so far!
503,14,"i have nothing but good things to say.however, if you are on the paranoid side, perhaps this is not for you. it is always listening.otherwise it fun, useful and really does so much. i am not the type to overdue, but between this and my dots, my home has 4 units. it seems that alexa adds new skills everyday.the price is certainly right."
504,14,"i am thinking the 1star reviews are from before the software update people are talking about, because the sound is amazing! i bought a 3pk and have them all hooked to my original 1st gen echo. i have all 4 playing music at once throughout the house and its incredible! there are 7 microphones on top so she can hear you a lot better than on the first gen. give it a shot people! do not listen to the older reviews!"
505,14,i liked everything about echo (2nd generation). i love the sound and also like that the echo fits anywhere. thank you
506,14,"probably the best amazon purchase i have made.  you can get local weather, local news, and stream your music.highly recommend."
507,14,the sound is not as loud as i thought it would be.  i like the prime music but have to use an app on my phone.
508,14,i love it
509,14,i love this! i
510,14,i love the sound is awesome !!! i can ask echo to look or do something from two rooms away.
511,4,love it!
512,7,works well and sounds great - what is not to like??will it work in france??
513,14,wish this was more interactive.  of course that means it would cost a ton more!
514,7,works great!  i plan on making my entire house alexa friendly
515,6,love it - the material is wonderful. sound and system works great!
516,7,love it. still trying to get the hang of talking to her.
517,14,"the new echo generation is shorter and less expensive, but giving the same great performance. this is our second echo; one lives in my office and the new one lives in our family room. the main job it has in our home is playing music which it does flawlessly. with two of them, we can either play music simultaneously but independently, or we can play the same music in two rooms.the list of home automation devices is growing for us and echo is right there for them. (looking to get a sprinkler controller next spring.) echo is starting to make home ai a reality which is ok by me. i am looking forward to how smart it can get.thanks, amazon for the beginning of a great product."
518,7,easy to setup and use. have enjoyed it is use.
519,7,love it!
520,6,the echo (2nd generation is a great device. the size is just the right size and the clarity of sound that emits from the speaker is of great quality. i would recommend without reservation the echo (2nd generation) to family members and friends.
521,7,great product. love my echo
522,14,"i love alexa! i live in the woods alone and my children got her for me to have someone to talk to. i get my flash briefing, weather and music. it came in handy when my phone was not working but i used alexa to call my family."
523,7,this is a great product.  the sound was perfect for us with a big open concept house. my kids love to use it too.
524,14,what can be said that all of the other reviews have not covered? it looks good. it sounds good. my family and i like it!
525,7,love this thing!  can not find enough things to do with it!!!!
526,14,"this is a damn good product. will recommend to my friends, if i had some, lol..."
527,14,great value for $99 - sounds excellent after recent update.
528,6,sound quality is great and alexa is super helpful
529,14,we bought it at the same time as homepod. it is much more versatile. and sound is great for a small speaker. along with 1/3 the price of honepod.
530,7,always a pleasure to use one of them.
531,7,i think it is great  when  you are alone it is great company
532,14,"the sound quality is exceptional for something that takes up so little space.  after the last update the bass improved quite a bit.  i enjoy being able to stream my favorite music and, then add things to my grocery list.  this one is in my kitchen and i just love it."
533,14,"love our new addition to the echo family.  love the cover too.  we have two echos ( 1st and 2 nd editions) and two dots, one i put a pretty denim cover on for the kitchen.. i use them all the time for timers and at night to listen to rainstorms to fall asleep or drown out other noises."
534,14,"nice looking exterior -  i like the bluetooth capability -  the sound quality does not seem to be improved over the original echo i have -- i most definitely  do not like the change on top of the unit - the original with the rotating volume control is much easy to operate, especially if you are in a hurry to adjust - its not easy to find the correct buttons for volume up/down unless you are looking directly at it and harder at night.  i also thought that this model was supposed to be more responsive to the alexa command if the volume was turned up loud.... have not seen much improvement there.overall, i love the echo product, i just think my original was a better more usable unit and has great sound.  i heard there may be a software update that can cause better sound, just not sure how to know if its been updated."
535,14,"i honestly hate this thing. got it for free as a gift, and it has been the most annoying experience. the only music it can play is pandora, which is inconvenient enough, but i figured at least it could answer questions for me when my hands are full... nope, literally nine times out of ten that i ask a question, she says ""i am sorry, i do not know that.""definitely not worth the price."
536,7,having fun with it.
537,14,"before purchasing this echo, i read many of the reviews between the 5 star and 1 star categories.  i also read the alexa app review which was not great.  i decided to give the echo a try anyway, and i received it on 12/28/17.  it worked effortlessly for about 5 days...then i lost the wi-fi connection.  followed every instruction i could find to fix this, including contacting my internet service provided who assured me all was fine on their end.  since my other devices were working, i then called customer service, sent the echo in for repair, got it back 4 days later and tried again.  same problem, so it was returned, and a brand new one was delivered immediately.  when i connected that one, i had the same issue.  i decided it was not an echo problem and that it had to be a wi-if connection problem.  decided to order a new router with stronger capabilities and, as of today, the problem has been resolved.  for those of you leaving 1 star reviews due to connectivity issues, i suggest you look a bit further to determine if a stronger router would take care of this issue for you as it did for me.  and thank you, amazon, for all you did to try and alleviate this problem when your product was not to blame at all."
538,6,has great sound!
539,14,"the echo 2nd gen is great. the setup took a little longer than some of the other reviewers, somehow it was deleted from my devices menu on the app which is the reason for the four stars. it is been up and running for about a week now and i have only had one problem when the device was unavailable which was fixed by unplugging, waiting about 30 seconds and plugging it back in.  this controls my first gen firestick, tp-link wifi outlet and honeywell thermostat with no problems.  the echo is very sensitive and it can be controlled by voice from about 25-30 feet away.  it can even understand our 4 year old who loves calling his friends through the echo.  the speaker sound is wonderful and definitely fills the room.  i would definitely recommend the echo as a main unit for a living room or kitchen (or wherever you spend a lot of time) then buying a dot for additional rooms."
540,4,"gave it as a gift, she loves it. i have on also."
541,6,very clear sound
542,4,fantastic! purchase..a gift from my sons
543,7,sound
544,14,easy to use. great sound. great price!  got 4 of them for every room in the house along with the spot!  loving the set up.  connected to spotify and lights and other smart devices in the home also.
545,14,"sound is good but it never understands me.  amazon already replaced my first echo because of this, pretty difficult to keep using when i have to ask it 4 or 5 times to do something.  daily, my echo will red ring and tell me it is having trouble. not worth your money."
546,14,"i got this for my husband for christmas.  he did not use it.  a couple of weeks ago i moved it to a more central area in the room.  i have an echo dot that works grreat.  this echo has a problem with the volume. it is fine and then the next time i use it, the volume is too low.  is anyone else having a volume problem with this model?"
547,7,"like alexa but she says a lot of the time ""i do not know how to answer that""...i thought she would be the smartest in the room but my 18 year old knows more..alittle disappointed"
548,14,"the echo has terrific sound,  a great mix of bass and treble. i enjoy the wide range of questions i can ask her, and the news is accurate and relativelt unbiased.  i can also hook up my roomba and other wireless devices, so echo helps me manage my life. next up, sync echo to my google calendar."
549,14,the sound really fills the room. the echo will stop playing for no reason. wifi speed is vey strong. really frustrating when the system drops.
550,7,handy for questions and music.
551,14,like it still working on figuring it out.
552,14,"the great thing about the new echo- it supports calls. have elderly parents, life alert type devices are good but often left on sinks or nightstands. i put this in the living room and 2 echo dots in other parts of the house. if someone falls- they only need to say ""alexa, call matt is cell"". it does not support 911- but they would probably spend the night on the floor rather than call 911. if i do not answer- they can go down their list of contacts- my sister, brother, neighbor etc."
553,14,"this device only works sporadically.  most of the time, alexa says she is having trouble understanding me, to try again later."
554,7,absolutely love the sound
555,7,works very well! exactly like it is advertised.
556,6,putting the package between the front door and storm door is a good idea.
557,7,"love it - so nice to have music, weather and news instantly!"
558,6,"presently surprised with the rich sound and ease of use.  in one way better than my cd player with cd! . amazon does a good jobwith known artists, hope they can include unknow or little known christian speakers and musicians .well worth the price !"
559,7,love it very much
560,7,"i am paralyzed and alexa is becoming a thing i do not know how i got along without her before she turns lights on and off, tells me when stuff is arriving, it is just a cool interactive thing to have i am impressed"
561,14,great device. i¡¯ve had the 1st gen model since it came out and this 2nd generation device did not disappoint! great updated sound (once the software update was applied) and looks good. ordered echo dots for all the rooms in the house as well.
562,14,i love the echo products. the all-new echo with improved sound does not deliver what it promises....  sound is not very good.  buyer beware on this.update:well.  got a call from amazon and they were very professional and transparent.  i am still not a fan of this particular echo as it is shipped today but i do believe they continue to update the firmware and with their attitude and diligence i am sure they will nail it.  probably re-buy one in 6 or so months to see how it is improved. the first update was pretty dramatic in a positive way.  moving my rating from a 1 to a 3.
563,14,it is great!
564,7,the echo is easy to use and install. it is fun to have around almost like friend with quick information and instant help. we have not had anything to dis lie yet.
565,6,improved sound over the echo dot.
566,7,the best big brother my kids and i can get!
567,7,i love how you can listen to music on it and how you can talk to alexa and give her commands to do stuff...i like how you can order stuff also
568,4,love!!!!
569,7,i love her.  we are learning things from & about her every day.
570,14,great product.
571,14,"i am comparing to the first gen echo in this review, as i suspect many others want to know the differences as well.first, compared to the first gen echo, it sounds tinny and far inferior.  side by side, it is shocking and it is hard to believe  they advertise this as having improved sound.  it weighs a lot less, too, probably as a result of smaller speakers and magnets in gen2.they also did away with the volume ring on the top, probably in a cost savings maneuver...this was a handy feature.it does seem a bit more responsive and faster,  but i¡¯d much rather have better sound quality, and i¡¯m betting a lot of other people do as well.i got a fabric model but i think i will regret that...as it is used in the kitchen and will be victim to splatters and such...the hard plastic of the old model is easier to clean and looks new once cleaned..this one likely will not.setup was also problematic.  i was able to easily find its wi-fi network, but once i tried to finish the setup i kept getting error messages.  after trying the same process, and resetting the echo each time, it finally worked.  there is definitely a hiccup in the setup process."
572,0,very cool <f0><u+009f><u+0091><u+008d>
573,14,i really like the alexa and and echo products. i have used an echo dot for a while now. so when i saw this one for a lower price point with a better speaker. i bought it. but my only complaint and why it got 4 out of 5 stars. is that the microphone on this one does not pick up as well as the older echo dot we had. have to almost yell at it to get it recognize that you are talking to it. minor issue more just annoying.
574,7,"love it!! super easy to set up and great quality. a wonderful gift, i use everyday!"
575,14,i like this product. it does have some problems finding certain channels on my dish receiver.
576,7,love it!!
577,14,"i would have given this more stars however after having it a few short months it no longer hardly ever hears me say ""alexa"" does not matter how loud or quiet i say it. it also turns on when nothing is being said around it."
578,4,our alexa was a gift to ourselves after seeing it at our daughters.  we were amazed what we could ask and alexa knew the answer. so happy with ours that we gifted one to our son and daughter-in-law! think they love there is too!
579,14,for a few days it played new age music then one day it could not.  does it even play music as on an i pod?
580,7,loving this little helper! super easy to use
581,7,love it great way to have music playing and can answer most questions.
582,7,super fast shipping.  works great although it was somewhat of a headache to set it all up.
583,7,enjoy it v to y much!
584,7,easy to use and set up
585,14,"parents love this thing, no issues to date."
586,6,this 2nd generation echo is fantastic. the improved sound is also a big improvement. great product!
587,14,"works as expected, it can hear my voice throughout my entire first floor."
588,14,i love this product.  it took a few tries to get it connected at home to my network but once connected it works as advertised.  i only use it for music and news through voice commands at this point but i intend to explore more features soon.  good sound quality and entertaining for folks that do not have one and especially those who have not heard of them.
589,7,no... alexa does not know anything that i have asked
590,4,a gift for my daughter.  i am sure she will love it!
591,7,"works great, very sensitive picking up my voice and requests even when i am not near it."
592,6,moving over from the first generation echo. sound quality is massively improved. alexa is voice also has a lot more bass and is more lifelike. music through bluetooth or streaming is excellent. even at max volume the music is not distorted.
593,6,"the sound quality is very good,  setup was a little awkward"
594,14,"i have bunch of echo dots and i wanted to get a bit better sound for my bedroom, so i got the echo. i was very disappointed from the sound of the echo, and i could here mostly bass. it is way to boomy and if you have it close to a wall it gets even worst - no way to adjust the bass. to be honest the dots sound better then the echo, and if you really need better sound, i would recommend to get echo and connect it via bt to your favorite speaker."
595,14,"[11/20/2017 update] the echo 2 periodically loses its connection to spotify connect. it just vanishes from the list of available devices in the spotify app. my 1st gen echo and tap are not affected and they are on the same wifi network and near the echo 2. it is still online and i can still say, ""alexa, play playlist <name> on spotify>. the problem seems isolated to the spotify app itself. this could be a problem that spotify has to fix but it is annoying enough to be a reason to hold off on buying an echo 2 if you regularly connect to your echo through spotify connect. unplugging the echo 2 and plugging it back in sometimes fixes the connection problem, but not always.[11/4/2017 update] i got the firmware update - the alexa app now shows the software version as a number ending in 5420 (formerly 5320). i noticed a big improvement in the bass and overall richness. it is really quite good now. i really did not expect them to be able to fix this through software, and i appreciate amazon getting it out so fast! i was getting my box ready to return it.[previous 1-star review, based on poor audio quality in the echo 2 unit i received october 31st]i pre-ordered it specifically because amazon promised improved audio. i could not believe it - it sounds the same, if not worse, than the gen 1. echo. i spent a good hour doing side by side comparisons on a variety of songs, echo 1 vs. echo 2, and the echo 1 was the winner on every single one. the echo 2 sounds flat and hollow, especially at lower volumes!this is the same disappointment i felt after buying a tap. i do not think amazon knows what a good speaker sounds like.everything else is as-advertised, though, so i feel like it is probably too harsh to give it a 1 star rating, but i only bought it because of the promise of improved audio (i already have an alexa device in every room)."
596,7,"she is a nice addition to our house. we chat with her daily. indispensable no, but a welcome source of information and amusement."
597,14,i think google and siri respond better  more realistic answers
598,7,i was pleasantly surprised on how much i enjoy the echo.
599,6,excellent quality and sound.
600,7,works wonderful works great with the other echo in my house
601,14,i¡¯ve been disappointed in the functionality.
602,14,"alarm settings sometimes work and sometimes not. can not set multiple alarms hours apart. needs alexa to understand if the internet session is up and running. she will state that she is connected, but it is obvious that something must be wrong when nothing happens. example: when requesting the daily brief, she will indicate ""your daily brief"" followed by no sound at all. is that an echo or internet problem? needs to allow scheduled music. limited functions (alarm / music / light control) needs to be able to work without an internet connection.sound is very good."
603,7,as expected
604,14,"while the echo has some very nice features i had to return it to amazon. the reason... it would not play google music easily and amazon music is just not up to snuff in that regard. amazon music would require me to spend $2 a month so that i can listen to my own mp3s. and, it does not appear to have the ability to favorite stations that i like nor easy to search for those stations.for this main reason i returned the product and opted for the google home system instead."
605,7,"love the sound quality , nothing to dislike"
606,7,"portable, easy to use"
607,7,great gift
608,14,ease of use after being connected. wish the local fm station came in with better clarity.
609,7,"i really like it, does more then i expected and the sound is great"
610,7,"great sound, with an immense amount  of functions. can not think of anything i did not like."
611,14,awesome
612,7,awesome
613,7,love everything about it.
614,7,easy to use and great sound.
615,7,love this product. easy to set up and very friendly. all of friends and family are surprised on how easily i can control my entire house with alexa. .
616,14,"we got this for our 98 year old mother, and after a couple of times of instruction,she now talks to her all the time.easy to set up and use, plenty loud for the hard of hearing."
617,6,excellent product and the sound quality is very good.
618,7,new for me. need to learn how to use it better but very pleased so far
619,7,"such fun. great being able to just ask for music, weather, or information. allows you to play music and pause when you need to. does so much more. i am just learning all things she/it can do. i want one in every room!"
620,14,"this device is amazing, do not understand why i waited so long to get one - very happy with it, out of the box and functioning flawlessly in minutes."
621,7,"best thing since the gps. i use it to play songs i want, to meditate, to obtain daily or weekly weather, day and time. there are many more options that i plan on using. it it is easy set up even for me. ps i can ask it to give me jeopardy questions snd to compliment me. practical and fun"
622,6,"sandstone color.device is better than gen 1, but the sandstone color needs to come with the white power cord, not black."
623,6,the echo has a better sound than the original.
624,7,great for the blind to listen to music.
625,6,the echo 2nd gen fabric edition has great sound<u+2014>i love it and would buy it again.
626,14,"i do not have this item but i am giving it a 1 star because i am deaf and this product does not benefit the deaf and hard of hearing community because it relies heavily on voice commands and such. since i can not hear or speak well enough verbally for me to use echo, it does not benefit me in any way other than having it as an expensive paper weight with flashy lights. with the advancement in technology, it amazes me that amazon would create a product that would exclude the deaf and hard of hearing community so i guess this is amazon is idea of making fun of the deaf and hard of hearing community. thanks amazon for the useless product that i will never ever get to use in my lifetime and my hearing friends and family members kept telling me that i have been missing out on a lot with this product. i appreciate it."
627,14,constantly quits playing....rebooting several times a day...this product has way too many bugs to recommend
628,14,"i love the sound. for the price, it has great value. i bought two to go along with my echo dot that controls the stereo. makes for a great surround sound without having to run more wires."
629,7,it is great. music
630,7,"i love my alexa, my family has fun with her and the fact that i can talk to family from other states with alexas is a plus."
631,14,my husband and i have had a lot of fun thinking of music from our past(and that goes back a long way}to see if we could find something that alexa did not have at her fingertips  so far we have not found many songs that could not be played in a few seconds and we have enjoyed that.
632,7,easy to use
633,0,great sound quality for a small unit. love it with the music unlimited. <f0><u+009f><u+0091><u+008d> <f0><u+009f><u+0091><u+008d>
634,14,not as good as the 1st generation in sound.  it is smaller and comes with different cover configurations - so that is a plus for those looking for those options.  i continue to use the 1st gen much more than my 2nd gen as audio output is my favored way of using the echo.
635,7,not impressed...
636,14,"bought this for my living room and an echo dot for my bedroom. loved it so much, i bought 2 more dots as christmas presents."
637,0,i love my alexa <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+008d>
638,4,i bought it for my granddaughter and she loves it!
639,14,too difficult to set up.  had to give up trying.
640,7,love my echo
641,4,we love it!
642,7,very happy with this product
643,14,the volume is amazing compared to the dot.
644,7,i thought this would be great but i managed to get the stupidest alexa available.  she does not answer any questions.  can not find any songs.  what a waste of money.
645,7,i. love. alexa. she can do almost anything! a must during parties for music. she plays jeopardy so i¡¯m in heaven. <u+2764><u+fe0f>
646,14,"this is my first echo, so my review is not based on a comparison to the first generation.  in general, i still do not see the usefulness of the echo, google home, etc.  however, my household had a specific need for a compact speaker to play music.  the echo dot is sound quality would not have been good enough.  so at $99, this is a really good option.  as a smart speaker, it is really effective.  it is convenient to walk into the room and say ""shuffle this playlist"" or ""shuffle that album.""  the alternative is finding your phone, connecting to a bluetooth speaker, and starting playback.  i much prefer the echo for its wireless capability.  seems to get good wifi signal and has good sound quality.  i will be considering another for a different room."
647,14,my husband and i just love it!  can not belive we waited this long to get one!
648,7,"love it.  it is practical for setting timers and alarms, but it is fun to play around with also."
649,4,we love our christmas gift to each other.  works great
650,4,what an amazing product. i never tire of conversing with alexa!!!
651,7,it is absolutely amazing
652,7,we love it.  echo does even more than we expected.
653,7,works good
654,7,i like everything about this echo
655,7,"so easy to set up and use,music at my voice...."
656,7,easy to set up and works as advertised.
657,7,sounds great!!
658,4,is it any wonder americans' cannot save for retirement. more useless junk.
659,14,the sound is way better than the dot. we love it!
660,7,"i love <u+2764><u+fe0f> it!  i am amazed at it, i know there are many more ways i can use it...i just have not had time to check them out!"
661,7,i love it!  i get to choose what i want to hear.  rarely does alexa not find the music i request.  i love getting the weather without turning on the tv.
662,7,"not sure who is really listening ,,,,sounds great...but i am concerned about big brother listening..so i disconnect when not listening to it"
663,7,we like the sound and ease of listening to the songs we like. sometimes alexa can not find the songs we request.
664,7,"while alexa is very good for things like playing music, giving you current weather and such she is not so quick or helpful with answers to questions,like from a crossword puzzle."
665,14,some issues with connecting to skills. does not work all the time correctly.
666,14,"does not,t seem to to connect worth the mkindle needs more info then you get with the echo"
667,7,everything i have order has been great.
668,14,i would like to return it
669,7,love it great sound
670,7,does exactly what i need it to do. fits in great with out sonos set-up.
671,4,love it! i have wanted one for so long and im so glad that we finally have alexa in our house. she helps solve arguments and decide what for supper. makes tons of list. love it.
672,14,"i own a first generation echo purchased over a year ago (now being sold as the echo plus) which continues to impress me.  as a christmas gift i purchased a new echo for my wife to be used at home.  much to my surprise, the 2nd generation echo is a huge disappointment;  poor audio quality, tiny base, poor microphone pick-up and....surprisingly.... even the voice command logic seems to be less effective.  out of curiosity, i brought my 1st generation echo home from the office to compare side-by-side.  it would appear my suspicions were confirmed.  the 2nd gen echo is noticeably poorer quality option.  i am not an audiophile, nor a techie, but even i can notice the difference.  obviously,  amazon went cheap to lower the price-point.  if my wife has not already thrown out the box, i am intending to return it."
673,7,works great and easy to set up. now we want more!
674,7,love it.  sounds great and is fun
675,4,it is the new modern day version of a genie in a bottle. we use it everyday.
676,7,liked it so much i bought another.
677,14,awesome. excellent hearing commands. use it for talking between rooms. for music and of course for alexa info. music sounds excellent.
678,14,i am not impressed by this. i seems to understand me better than siri but she can play my downloaded music. having to use amazons stupid music unlimited means i have to be extremely specific otherwise she just guesses a song. other than that i do not see a point to buying this. all it does right now is tell me the weather.
679,4,happy happy happy
680,4,gave as a gift. they love it and play with it even
681,7,i am really happy with alexa
682,7,i love it!  just need to learn to program it better.
683,14,you can not set up this to be an intercom using a pc or a fire tablet.
684,14,"after the echo is set up no problem. it took more than half a dozen tries to complete the set-up, after that no problems or issues. if you enjoy music you will love the sound."
685,0,nice <f0><u+009f><u+0091><u+008d>
686,7,"good sound, just its set up for usa residents more so than canadians.. still functional though"
687,0,<f0><u+009f><u+0091><u+008d><f0><u+009f><u+0091><u+008d><f0><u+009f><u+0091><u+008d>
688,7,alexa is my best girl
689,7,nice sound.
690,0,love it! easy to set up and use. my family is having fun asking alexa questions and the sound quality is good enough for rockin¡¯ out while i cook <f0><u+009f><u+0091><u+00a9><u+200d><f0><u+009f><u+008d><u+00b3>
691,7,"great sound. i¡¯m very pleased, better that what i was expected."
692,14,"i think its ok to have, takes a while to get use to. lots of times it give you what you do not ask for, but i think for people who have everything linked to it, might get the best out of it."
693,4,"i bought this for a christmas gift. found out it answers questions with s very liberal agenda as in: ""who is jesus christ? answer "" jesus christ is a fictional character "". really?? get s grip! thinking about canceling amazon all together!"
694,14,love her music.  kind of stupid.  really have to lead here when asking here to think.  she would rather not commit to an answer
695,4,i bought this for my mom for christmas and she loves it more than the plates my brother got her #favoriteson
696,14,sound good but can not hear my voice command over loud music.
697,4,loved the quickness of fast selection of music for listening at different points of the day depending on my mood at the moment.
698,7,i like this much more the dot.  better speakers.
699,7,"i love alexa! she has become a part of the family!!! i almost can not live without her. i play games, get my daily weather forecast, and ask unlimited questions! she even predicted that my team the philadelphia eagles was going to win the super bowl and she was right! could not be happier! thanks, amazon!"
700,7,love the music
701,4,i love my echo so much i bought one for everyone in my family and even my parents. they love it.
702,7,i love love love my echo! always wanted one and using it has become my life haha. officially replaced my alarms and daily routines with alexa. only thing i wish the echo could do is make internet searches. anything that is somewhat opinion based she can not answer so that is a bummer but otherwise super awesome and super amazed by all the extras she can do when looking on the app!
703,4,amazing! i brought it for my mom as a birthday gift and she absolutely loves it.
704,6,great sound recognition and quality of speaker.  there are many options that i have not selected due to cyber security concerns.  love amazon music option!
705,14,the echo is an ingenious item to have!!! i love this thing! i use it most for music and to use the drop in feature to connect to my echo dot in my husbands man cave. saves me a walk. the speaker is loud and clear and i love i can control the volume by voice. it is small and fits anywhere.
706,7,really does what it says it does.
707,14,audio is no where near as good as the first gen echo. huge step back.
708,14,love it
709,7,"well i can not say that there is anything i really thoroughly enjoy about echo, i have used a competitor is product in the past through my phone app whose second name is assistant and is by far incredibly more intelligent and able to provide quick information without me having to repeat myself too many times. what i do like about it is it is hooked up to my music on my account so so far it is been a really good stereo"
710,14,absolutely worthless to me. i thought that it would be a fun and useful tool to have but it was a total waste of 100 bucks. my phone and watch tell me the time and temp and my remote can change channels faster and easier. this will not even find the channel guide on dish. it can not turn my tv off and on even though it is a smart tv hooked to the internet too. i do not have smart lights or thermostats and if i am gone and there is a power outage who will reconnect the units?? so i wasted money buying alexa it serves me little.
711,14,so far it is okay. it will not sync my music from my iphone for some reason which is annoying but i¡¯m sure it¡¯ll still be a good purchase
712,7,love it
713,14,i have 7 different echo products i have the 1st and 2nd generation echo. like the sound quality of the first generatiounbetter. the 2nd gen. is much cheaper. well worth the money .love my echos
714,7,i love it
715,7,"enjoying the question of the day ! also news. there is alot i can not get alexa to do ,not on prime but only get social security very limited on funds.would love for her to play some music."
716,14,going to buy more of these throughout my home.  speaker sounds great and microphones work from a great distance away
717,7,such a nice color and the sound is awesome!
718,4,i got this for my son for christmas and he absolutely loves it! works perfectly and quick shipping as well.
719,14,this new version sound quality is poor. it also has issues with hearing voice commands...
720,7,love this
721,7,love it love it love it!!!!!!
722,14,best device ever. like having your own personal assistant. i immediately bought the philips hue bulbs and can turn them on/off change color/ambiance. definitely recommend this product.
723,7,cant live with out it
724,14,great product
725,7,sound is great. i am really happy with it.
726,7,works pretty well.  it takes a little while to learn how to speak alexa so that she will understand exactly what you are asking.
727,6,definitely nicer sound.  more compact and the appearance fits in nicer with the family room.  i really like it.
728,14,"really enjoying the echo.  get accurate weather reports upon request.  no longer waiting for weather channel updates.  also, enjoy the music choices from country to pop.  can hear an entire album or the top choices in a music genre.  jokes are corny--perfect for a 7-year-old granddaughter to take to school.  love using the any-do app for grocery shopping."
729,14,i know nothing about this 2 3rd gen . i may have a beta version  but it is still going strong. i do not have the best quality internet where i live but i can still enjoy great sound i music and games.. mu friends are still impressed with  alexa.
730,7,love the music
731,7,we love our new echo especially to access the variety of music available through amazon music but still trying to figure out what words to use to get what we want from alexa.
732,6,the sound quality is great!!
733,7,i like it a lot.
734,6,quality of sound and many choices of various music amazon  offers. beautifully made.
735,4,love it!  wonderful for a quick question as well as a barrage of quick questions with fiends for entertainment.
736,7,christmas gift for my husband . its set up and ready to go. can not wait to see the look on his face.
737,7,i honestly really like my alexa echo.  she is especially helpful if she is connected to spotify.  it is really fun to ask her random questions and she can just answer them! the only annoying thing is that i can not figure out how to ask her how to set an alarm with a different ringtone.  the set ringtone is pretty annoying :(
738,7,"i am still learning about this device, but so far i love it. sounds quality is decent. there are a lot of skills available."
739,7,the sound is amazing. still learning all the things it can do
740,7,sound could be better for music
741,7,great product we love it!!!
742,7,i love it!!!!!
743,7,love this.
744,14,bought additional items to control lights and outlets. works great! the sound is incredible and we even got a thermostat you can control from your phone
745,7,have really enjoy alexa the modt
746,14,"it is hard to find anything bad about the echo.  since getting one i have connected my lamps/lights with smarthome and also my nest thermostat.  there is nothing better than adjusting the heat/ac from your bed - what is worse than waking up freezing in the middle of the night and having to walk to the thermostat?! ""alexa, turn the temperature up 5 degrees""...done, love it.  you can pretty much control everything through the echo.  for music, it works best with amazon music - however you can still sync pandora, siriusxm, etc.  it is $3.99/month for amazon music, which is well worth it - the library is extremely extensive; i was even able to find songs by non-mainstream local artists i would have never thought they would have in amazon music.  for the price of the echo, it is worth every penny.  i plan to get echos as gifts for family and friends; everyone who is come to my home and tried it thinks it is so cool.  alexa is my girl!"
747,7,i love my echo! it truly does make my life easier. it keeps me informed as well as entertained. i am excited to learn more about my echo and see what all it has to offer!
748,7,it has a very good sound when playing music
749,14,have two echos and love them! great if you have prime because you can listen to music along with the many other functions!
750,7,great device.  am exploring ways it can help around the house.  hoping it can help my wife with her memory problems so am looking at what the capabilities are.
751,7,still getting to know it.  satisfied so far
752,14,"the sound is so-so when playing music. otherwise, the echo is used in our home, more or less, as a toy. it is handy for a weather report, but that is about it for ""practical"" functions for us. it has trouble connecting to the fire stick and has successfully only once in multiple attempts. i think it worked after a fire stick ""reset, but  only that one time."
753,6,very usefu
754,7,i love my echo.  we use it all the time.
755,14,"felt like it was spying on us!! would say ""hello"" randomly without saying ""alexa"" and even applauded out of nowhere. i liked the convience factor but overall my privacy wins! i do not recommend unless you like being spied on."
756,7,major sound difference we are loving it!
757,14,"if you have children or kids visiting and you¡¯re old, you need this!! i love that it reads my books online to me also. what fun it has been to dance with my great niece (20 months) to polka music, ricky martin and twinkle twinkle little star!!"
758,7,"still learning all the echo can do.  only weakness is that it has a learning curve for many of the requests.  also, speaker quality, while good, could certainly be better.  think bose or jbl..."
759,7,i like its knowledge but does not have all the songs that i want to hear.
760,4,"holy crap, i love this thing."
761,7,love the music and that i can order by talking to her.  there is nothing i do not like about it yet <f0><u+009f><u+00a4><u+0097>
762,14,"sounds great,  did have to sign up for music tunes at $3.50 per month, but can get almost anything wanted to play now.  very versatile."
763,4,wonderful item  have three and will buysome more  for the family who are delighted with it
764,7,great for kids!!!
765,14,"it does what is says it will do and i am sure more, i am excited to see what they will come out with next"
766,7,alexa stuck with her convictions that the philadelphia eagles would win the superbowl.
767,7,family loves it.  i¡¯m not a tech person but echo was very easy to setup and use.
768,6,sound is a lot fuller than the first generation.  good job amazon!
769,14,"trying to get it to play podcasts (via stitcher) with non-dictionary names  e.g. ""petapixel..."", ""canadaland"" is a complete fail. worse, it will play what it thinks you asked for, which is off-base 100% of the time. further, i bought mine via amazon.ca as i am in canada. despite my having a neutral accent, i decided to do the voice-training. nope. that option is not available here in canada. this thing still needs a lot of work."
770,7,echo works great and is very interactive!
771,4,my family loves this product. my kid enjoys the jokes and my wife love to play music while cleaning or cooking.
772,7,"love my new echo, works great"
773,14,perfect .
774,14,great!!!!
775,14,love the look. do not like that i can not just reach over and turn the top for volume. i know i can tell her what volume number but enjoy the turn of the top on first generation.
776,4,daughter loves it
777,7,what i expected
778,7,not a gadget person but enjoy using alexa.
779,4,alexa is magnificent!!!
780,14,"love love love the echo! i have the dot and in comparison, the echo outshines the dot! the speaker quality on this device is very good. we are constantly listening to music and it fills our entire flat with music<u+200b>."
781,7,love it!
782,7,still exploring all the possibilities
783,14,"this is my first echo, well i did have the echo dot. this unit is absolutely awesome. the sound quality is amazing. with amazon prime searching for any song is efferetless. getting your calender, reminders weather ect is easier than reaching for my phone. very happy with my purchase."
784,4,it was a gift
785,7,it is awesome.  my entire family loves it.
786,6,"great! love the convinience, great sound"
787,14,"i¡¯ve had my  echo 2 for about a week now and pretty much concluded that i¡¯m going to return it, it is minor advantage of better sound is not enough for me to recommend it.there are several reasons for this.  first, i already own an echo dot and i find it better serves me than the echo 2.  the echo 2 does have better sound but for me this is unemportant since i mostly use the dot for podcasts and news where sound quality is not a factor, if i am going to listen to music i just turn on a spare sound bar in my living room and the dot connects and i have better sound quality than the echo 2, the two devices otherwise share exactly the same functionally.in the final score, all things considered, the echo dot is the superior device, at half the price. here is why:1. the dot is half the price2. about 1/4 the size3. performs exactly the same as the echo 24. uses micro usb cable & extensions for power5. can use any usb charger => 500 ma output6. can run off any usb 2000 mh+ battery that charges phones and tablets ($15 - $25.00)7. plugged into a battery it can run all day on battery alone, no hunting for a socket8. the dot is portable, the echo 2  ->  slaved to its proprietary power supply, is not.let me be honest.  from the second i saw that ugly wall wart and proprietary cable connector i hated the echo 2, i knew immediately, before turning it on that i was going to hate it because wall sockets are at a premium in my house.  worse, the sockets are almost always fully occupied, buried behind furniture and such.  early this year i changed most of the outlets in my house to ones that have usb sockets as well so i did not need to have extensions, socket adapters and so on, a ten foot after market usb extension cable can be had here for $5.00 at the local ¡°five below¡± store.none of this works for the echo 2.  with its clunky wall wart and a proprietary connector it is slaved to only the included power cord.  can not use it outside, can not use it anywhere without an outlet.had i been aware of this failing of the echo 2 i would not have ordered it, the far smaller, cheaper and much more flexible echo dot is simply a better choice. if i want to use it somewhere that has no wall socket i just plug it into one of my 8000 mh batteries, works for hours."
788,6,this was easily the best christmas present the speaker quality on the amazon echo 2nd generation is superb.
789,14,echo 2 generation is amazing and my 3 year old daughter love it! great speakers and great skills app
790,6,"immediate reaction, ease of use, and the great sound. merry birthday"
791,14,"i love my echo, and i have had a 1st generation for awhile. i just got a few of the gen 2s, and i am going back and forth between 3 and 4 stars. the gen 2s as a product are not as good as the gen 1. some features are cool, like the outer shells, and how you can change them out. the sound is the issue, which is in a lot of the previous reviews. it sounds like the echo is in a cave, or under water. i wish the sound of the gen 2s at the very least, has the same sound quality of the gen 1s. the multi-room function is great,  but it is only half way there. you have to put echo is into groups in order for them to play the same feed, however you can only put an echo into one group at a time. then multi-room only works for certain skills, but not for routines or news flashes. i like these, and i probably will not return them. however, they still have a bit to go."
792,7,"love my alexa i wish she would know a little more, especially traffic info. one thing mine keeps on playing a little depressive music"
793,14,"i was skeptical at first but asked for the smaller echo for christmas. after setting it up and finding all it could do, i moved that one to the bedroom and ordered this for the main living area. they are much more useful on a day to day basis than i had ever imagined. especially like being able to do voice control for home automation devices. also nice to wakeup and ask alexa for the weather and what is on my calendar for the day!"
794,7,love listening my music and getting the weather!
795,7,absolutely love it!  we have so much fun cleaning to music!!
796,7,best gift yet.
797,14,"so much better than my dots in ability to hear me, and sound output quality."
798,14,"i have a defective echo dot, i have only had it since christmas.  i still have that dot!  i have talked to support twice now and the issue is not resolved and is on going.  i have wasted hours of my time on the phone to no use.  i have more than one echo device and this is the only one not working.  it has been reset twice and all the trouble shooting has been done but i still can not manage to contact someone with the power to exchange it.  the support is terrible.  even though i could follow what the rep was saying i do not think he could follow me.  either he was not well enough versed in the technology involved and the scripts did not allow him to keep up or he choose not to listen to me.  6 times i was put on hold while he consulted someone over simple questions."
799,6,alexa is fine but was not crazy about the grey fabric.  would have preferred black or wood tone.
800,14,just received my 2nd generation echo is and not at all happy with the sound quality compared to the 1st generation.  we have 3 1st generation echo is and 5 dot is throughout the house and love them.  just unboxed the 2nd generation and immediately you can tell the clarity and depth of sound is just not there.  i will definitely be keeping my 1st gen is and returning these.
801,7,alexa is an extremely helpful gadget.  what i like most about it is; its ability to give information on most topics instantly.
802,14,"i was offered a ""free"" in-home alexa setup with my echo.  this was supposed to involve someone coming to my house to setup my echo, my echo dot, and my other alexa-compatible devices.  not only did not amazon is services show up, but they did not call me and made me call them and wait on hold to find out what was going on.  they finally told me there were forms that had to be filled out to reschedule my appointment, which means i waited for over an hour for no reason and will have to jump through more hoops if i want this device setup as promised.  this was a real disappointment; i expect better service from amazon."
803,14,saying i love my echo is an understatement. i go to sleep listening to my playlist of rain every night. at work i listen to my playlist of easy music. could not have asked for anything better.
804,7,love it.  alexa is fun to use.
805,14,really enjoying echo! fun information at your voice command. love the music too!
806,14,"echo dot, echo and echo plus will only allow one of the echo is mentioned to play a song from our itunes library"
807,14,i liked first version and as far as i can tell there is no important difference to second version. i had a very hard time setting up a second network using my same iphone but different echo and different wifi network. eventually i got it to work but instructions are lacking!
808,7,"absolutely in love! the sound is great, ...i was surprised how nice it is."
809,14,the sound is excellent.  just got it today 11/26/2017.  the firmware upgrade must be working.  it sounds better than my original echo.
810,7,i love the music plus sound is goodi have enjoyed learning all it can do
811,14,yes it is fine product. i enjoy her very much.
812,7,i did not think i would like it but i really enjoy it!
813,7,"not perfect but close to it, it has a lot of potential but sometimes feels a bit limited hopefully it continues to evolve. so far it is okay not exactly the ""smart house"" from the movie but we will see how much it improves"
814,14,greatest invention ever!!! awesome sound!
815,7,love it
816,4,worked great
817,6,it is ok
818,14,santa brought several echos and a couple dots for the family. sent some others as gifts for those family members that have everything. alexa has been the biggest hit with our entire family! she can do more than i even expected. so happy with the echos and echo dots.
819,7,like the cover. having a blast with alexa. super helpful.
820,14,it was very easy to set up. hardest part was figuring out what skills to activate. it is still a work in progress on that area. i got a tp link plug to work my living room light. these were christmas presents. i only wish i could work my tivo with alexa.
821,4,love it
822,7,"easy to use, makes the day complete."
823,14,"<u+00a0>first time echo and alexa user . bought 2 dots for 2 family members for christmas.  let is just say awesome . yes the dots do not rock the house , but they do fill the air with just the right amount of music . both family members are completely stoked with there new helpful christmas dots .well after seeing how well the dots worked , i took the amazon gift card my son got me for christmas and picked up the echo ( 2nd gen ) . i have read a few reviews of very unhappy people / users . first the sound quality , it is perfect , i own a bose soundlink mini , the nose has more bass , but the echo has cleaner , clearer sound . also the bose was more then double the price, and is only a bluetooth speaker . the echo does so many cool little helpful things it is purely amazing . i also purchased the connect , and using our home phone line to make voice activated calls without a phone close by is straight awesome. i have gone ahead and ordered 1 dot for our master bedroom  and also a alexa controlled ir box for controlling all of our av equipment in the living room . <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0081><f0><u+009f><u+0091><u+008c> i am extremely happy with my purchase and all it does for me and my family ."
824,14,"not sure what need this fills.  if you do not care about the audio (e.g. you are using external speakers or want it primarily for automation), get an echo dot.  if you do care about the audio and do not want to add a speaker, get a full-blown echo.  i have two of these (of my nine echos), and they are not that impressive.  like the dot, it requires +/- buttons to change volume (lacks the dial found in the full-sized echo).  the far-field mic array works as well as the echo."
825,4,bought as a gift for my daughter in law. she loves it
826,7,love this device!  so much fun and like having another person in the room! sound is awesome!
827,14,"(original review was 2 stars - lowered to 1 on updates.)the claim about ""improved sound"" is untrue.  the sound is better in the original echo.  this is not a variation of quality issue - all three of the new units i received had tinnier sound than the original.  the only reason i am keeping them is the external audio jack, since bluetooth pairing does not work with multi-room audio yet.updates:1. it turns out that amazon was well aware of the sound deficiency, at the same time they were advertising the echo as having ""improved sound"" everywhere.  after posting this review, they contacted me and made me aware that they had attempted to tune the sound via software after the first units were shipped.  too bad i had already spent money on external speakers.  it would have been nice to tell their early customers about what they knew, and were doing about it.2. when these went on a lower sale for black friday, i called to see if amazon would at least match the price they were now offering.  after 30-40 minutes on hold and talking to four different people, they disconnected, with no call-back.  returning all three echos.  save your time and money."
828,14,"for the most part i am satisfied.  the sound experience is good, not great.  there could be more datato work with. i am sure as time goes on they will broaden the data to include the answers to more questions."
829,14,we are more impressed than what we thought we would be for the sound.  especially for the price and alexa built in.
830,14,needs help because it is easily confused and 'does not get it' as a reply..many generations to become better....if this the best ai around we are in trouble
831,7,easy to set up. nice speaker sound when playing music. already had the dot buteasy to set up. easy to use. good speaker sound when playing music. happy i bought it.
832,7,sounds great
833,7,wife got it for christmas.  very happy with it.  great quality and sound!
834,7,it is a neat thing to have! i love using it for music!!
835,7,will not play entire songs. do not want to pay for amazon music so i guess i¡¯m screwed.
836,7,i like it a lot exceeded my expectations
837,7,it is a nice device but the music sounds better on my bluetooth speakers
838,7,easy set up. easy to use.
839,7,i do not have a smart home so it is basically a toy.  sound quality is good.
840,7,nice sound.... love it
841,4,my sons loves it.
842,7,"love this thing!!!  i use it for just about everything....music, recipe finder, turning my lights on and off,...dimming."
843,14,purchased 3 units for my house. liked the idea of music in each room. did not realize that is not possible. only let is you listen to music on one unit at a time. even though you pay full price for each unit.
844,14,nice sound over gen 1 echo
845,7,"easy to setup once i found the alexa app. but, i do not think i downloaded enough of the  items on the app. alexa can not answer some of my easiest questions."
846,4,i like the concept but our dog is absolutely frightened by it and climbs up and shivers in our lap whenever we invoke alexa.
847,7,just amazing!!
848,7,the ¡°my alexa app¡± what is up with it?????
849,14,"we purchased this right around when it came out and it is gone through some major sound upgrades. at first it sounded slightly better than our echo dot (yes it was terrible). after several firmware updates the sound is very good. it is not a sonos or some high-end speaker, but for a $99 speaker it is very good.we have the echo plus, the echo (2nd gen), and the echo dot. we found the sound on the echo plus to be superior to the echo (even after all the firmware updates). we also like the twist dial knob for volume on the echo plus over the plus/minus buttons (the same as the echo dot) on the echo 2nd gen. as for voice recognition both the echo plus and echo 2nd gen are fantastic...i am talking music full blast and you can casually say ""alexa"" and it hears you.i would rate this 4.5 stars and the echo plus 5 stars. the echo plus sounds better and i prefer the twist dial knob for volume control vs buttons. the built in smart hub and free hue light that come with the echo plus along with the better sound makes it worth the extra $50 compared to echo 2nd gen. it is not like you can go wrong with either, but for the extra $50 i would say to get the echo plus."
850,14,the echo still has a ways to go before i would say it is very useful.  it is more of a glorified light switch or ac controller.
851,7,sound is much better and i like the size and color.
852,7,love it
853,7,absolutely a must buy. i could not manage without my echo. we have transformed our home to a smart home and have multiple devices throughout our home. easy to use and a great tool. thanks amazon!
854,7,"device is so much fun i can not stop talking to it. very useful for alarms, news and weather. great for music too especially with amazon music."
855,7,best thing i own!
856,7,easy to use
857,14,"love the clear sound, ease of operation.  i wish this new one made a sound when i say her name, like my old one did."
858,7,"so far i¡¯m loving her. gives me my notifications, reminders, my flash news and music. she is always here. plays games, tells jokes and even sings to me. love my echo.  she always has an answer to my question. alexa is part of the family...she can even shop for me"
859,7,like playing music. do not like that there are some pieces alexa does not play.
860,4,"annoying at times, fear of things being ordered accidentally. it responsonds to television adds. verdict still out at our home"
861,14,what a nice machine. became a must see and use by any people visiting our house. becomes the center of attention.
862,7,easy set up. response efficiency.
863,14,did not realize that echo had to remain plugged in.i have a slight accent cannot get her to understand me.
864,6,great sound
865,7,"works great, lots of fun!"
866,14,love that it is small and portable. do not like not getting it to work in my garage (50' away).
867,14,very easy to set up and use. got a tip from my sister to change the name i use from alexa to one of the others. she will pick up commercials and can make orders off the commercials. it would be nice to be able to choose any name you type in not the generic names they give you. other than that it is great. will get dots for the bedroom. as we get older this is a great tool if one is in another room and we need help in another room.
868,7,"the speaker quality is great,i love it."
869,6,a+
870,14,"i just bought the second generation echo, it felt heavy so i was curious about the sound quality and the dolby amazon advertises,  it turned out to be a disappointment, may be i should have bought google home instead. also, although i have a very fast internet, this one keeps cutting off when plays music. i will wait another week and see if there is an update, then if not satisfied i will return it."
871,14,wish i would have purchased a long time ago.linked all my wifi bulbs and outlet to it.i feel myself getting lazier with every command :)
872,7,i enjoy everything. just trying to set up my music from my iphone
873,14,everything working as expected- easier to set up since i already had an echo- less than 2-3 minutes and it was working!
874,7,just what we expected.  very happy.
875,7,love it and it sounds great!
876,14,bass is on point
877,14,a-plus
878,7,"arrived quickly, packaged well. i like the echo i can get my weather in the am and any music i want. the sound is great."
879,4,we love our echo!
880,0,it is very convenient i just ask alexa whatever i want. the sound is amazing i am glad i waited to get the 2nd generation echo i am very satisfied with my purchase <f0><u+009f><u+0092><u+009c><f0><u+009f><u+0092><u+009c><f0><u+009f><u+0092><u+009c><f0><u+009f><u+0092><u+009c><f0><u+009f><u+0092><u+009c><f0><u+009f><u+0092><u+009c><f0><u+009f><u+0092><u+009c><f0><u+009f><u+0092><u+009c><f0><u+009f><u+0092><u+009c><f0><u+009f><u+0092><u+009c>
881,14,i love this product! so worth the cost!
882,14,"love love love these devices. they are so helpful in so many ways. music - the sound is amazing for what it is. if you are expecting concert speaker sound out of a device that has a 2 something"" speaker in it, your delusional. have a bose soundlink color ii and the echo is comparable. the only thing missing is the deep bass you get with a bose but that is not to say that it does not have good bass. put in the right location, it sounds amazing. mine sits in a corner on a mini shelf at about 5'6"" off the floor. ease of use - alexa, (fill in the blank). it is so easy! and with all the skills available you can do so many things. just have to take the time to see what is out there. smart home - have 4 phillips hue bulbs in the house and i am hooked! can not wait to get more smart devices. if you are going to have ten or less then just buy the echo plus that has the built in hub otherwise, buy a starter kit that has a ""bridge"" and control up to 50 devices with alexa or from your alexa app from anywhere in the world that you can get service. routines - an alarm for me that tells me the weather for the day, an alarm for my 6yr old daughter that tells her she is awesome and can do anything she puts her mind to and turns my lights off for me and 10pm and on at 4am for my wife."
883,7,lots of fun
884,7,love it
885,7,love alexa- play my favorite music all the time
886,7,most the sound is really great  what would be the least  it do not have one works great looks great
887,7,just do not use it enough.
888,7,love it. easy to use with the iphone.
889,7,very helpful when calling to set it up  wish i had more information on what i can do  the manual is limited
890,14,great for my bar area!!!!
891,14,"title is misleading, because i bought the echo for $79 during the holiday sale!!! i am mainly a headphone guy, i have several pairs that get pretty pricey, as well as amplifiers. let me list some pros and cons of the echo.pros:+ compact (small footprint)+/- 360¡Æ sound (plays well in a variety of room locations, heard well from everywhere)+ alexa+ stylish designs+ feels well made, not like cheap plastic+ charger and cable feel qualitycons:+/- 360¡Æ sound- (possible) reliant on the quality of your wifi networklet me explain the +/- of 360¡Æ sound. firstly it is excellent because it is relatively impervious to location in a room. you can place it in a corner or in the center of a room and you have a consistent listening experience. the speakers are expertly tuned to provide a great listening experience for 99% of people without them having to be an audio enthusiast. but this is also it is source of contention. people compare it to directional bluetooth speakers, but this comparison cannot be made. directional speakers have a much easier time of producing sound because they only broadcast in, you guessed it, a single direction. but directional speakers also have their quirks, such as only sounding good when they are pointed directly at you, let is have any negative reviewer turn their comparator bluetooth speaker around and compare them that way!all in all, echo provides what i would determine as a 6/10 listening experience. 10 being $4k iems, 1 being children is toys. the $1000 stereo in the background is 8/10. most bluetooth speakers i have heard are 3-5/10."
892,6,plas my favorite public radio station with excellent sound
893,14,amazing sound quality for something so small!
894,7,great my son love it
895,14,i have been a fan of echo is since i received my first on.  this new 2nd generation has better sound and a plug for external speakers.  i love it!
896,14,"this product is great. why buy a bluetooth speaker when this is cheaper, sounds just as good, and can do way more"
897,7,i love using the reminder tool & being able to add events to my calendar.
898,14,not all the apps work. need to improve
899,7,love it!
900,7,"very good sound, easy setup."
901,7,love my echo it is great for senior citizens!!!
902,7,it has surpassed my expectations!!! easy to use out of the box and fun to try and master. love how it inigrates sonos.
903,7,does not work outside usa.
904,14,"the amazon echo meets our expectations 99.9% of the time. the remaining is either operator error, a wi-fi issue, or the problem of ¡°alexa¡± hearing the amazon echo commercials and thinks we are asking her to do something. she has some problems understanding our spotify playlist request but the remainer of the time she is a wonderful companion. she tells funny jokes, sings beautiful songs, and even takes you on magical adventures."
905,14,the new echo itself is okay my only complaint is that the app you have to download to use it is  terrible honestly i would not waste my money on this until they fix that. so disappointed i actually want to return my product just because the app is so bad
906,4,"my husband loves alexa; while he is doing business and has his hands full, he tells alexa to either look things up or to play his favorite music!"
907,7,love it i do not know how i made it without it thanks amazon
908,14,alexa is now in charge of the household.
909,7,performed as expected
910,14,i have been a fan for a long time.  nice to see the new styles.  keep up the great work amazon!
911,14,"get the google home. similar price, easier to talk to, does not mistake everything you say for a wake word, no trouble with amazon music , and it actually functions instead of needing very specifically-worded commands. you need to guess at the right term about 537637 times just to add a song to your playlist - which i can not access, by the way, thanks to the horrors of amazon music. and the app is utter garbage. do not buy it. get the google home. i am returning my 2nd gen echo for a full refund, and i will order the google home immediately after. amazon is service is marvelous, though. very sweet people.tl;dr: in contrast to the google home, the echo is kind of a butt."
912,4,i gave this as a gift to my daughter for christmas and she loves it!
913,6,complement my echo plus
914,7,i like everything about it so far. no major issues.
915,7,absolutely love my echo!
916,14,this echo was a christmas gift and i love how easy it is to use it.  i probably would not have bought it for myself because i would have thought it to be too complicated.
917,14,at first i liked the unity until i played music on it. terrible and i was sold on improvement. not so. switched back to my echo 1st generation and returned it. very disappointed.
918,7,it is awesome
919,6,very impressed with alexa and this speaker quality.
920,14,"at first, i thought, no this is not for me....i received it as a gift.  i absolutely love it.  does so many things!!!!"
921,7,we have been more than happy with the echo.
922,14,"i am very unimpressed with this thing.  i bought this for my wife for her birthday.  we already have an echo show and i am very impressed with that device.  we will primarily use this one as a music device, which was why i purchased this one.  it advertised ""improved sound"" and that was my deciding factor.  as far as a bluetooth speaker goes, this thing would hardly be worth $30.  i have a $40 jamtouch from 2015 that sounds much better than this thing.  the echo show has fantastic sound, so i assumed this one would be pretty good too.  as far as other features go, setup was easy.  voice recognition is spot on like the app and my other device, but that is software related.my wife says she likes it, so we are going to keep it... but if i had bought it for myself, it would be going back for sure."
923,4,everyone will say this is a life changer....love it
924,7,so far it exceeded my expectations
925,7,i love it!! i wish it was programed to have better humor and smart remarks.. haha
926,7,product was delivered on time and sounds awesome. could not be any happier with my purchase.
927,7,it is fun.  but really not that easy connect to apps.
928,14,"i did not think i would like this. i do not like to talk much at all. i never used alexa on my fire tv or siri on my iphone. however, it gets lonely around here in the day and it was nice to say something. alexa is upbeat and corny. she has useful skills. mostly, she plays my amazon music. (it will not play spotify unless you have a premium/paid account.it is not perfect; there are flaws. the speaker of the echo is good, but not great. i did not expect bose for $99, but it is not what i thought. it is better than the echo dot which i upgraded from because of the speaker. the ring lighting confused me at first. google that to find out. i got a green ring that would not go away (that is a message). you have to figure out how to play and delete those before it goes away.also, echo is always listening. it is like some black mirror plotline stuff! it is big brother. it is all those things, but i do not really talk much anyhow. you can mute it, but then you have to look at the red ring on top all the time. echo never sleeps and is always on (unless your wi-fi goes out). since she is always listening for keywords, she can not not listen. the company says they do not use it to retarget products to you, but it is hard to believe that they will not do anything with all that awesome data. to test this theory, i am going to say random things (without saying alexa to wake her first). tomorrow i will say armadillo or corndogs a few times all day. i will see if i start seeing ads for those things online. i know, paranoid!overall, there are lots of uses. i think it will get way better. i turned off the shopping and reordering stuff though. that i like to see first hand!"
929,7,terrific.. i am a music lover... all genres.... alexa comes through with the requests
930,14,i love alexa  what more is there to say
931,14,i like the music and the ease of operating. it took me along time to get it working with my ipad and wifi and felt the directions could be made easier for a sr. who is not too tech savvy.
932,14,"the echo is everything you need for music, weather, news etc. so many uses and always at a voice command away. forever improving the space age jetsons finally in your household."
933,14,"i love the echo, and i love alexa.  super responsive, super helpful, and the speakers are high quality.we also have the tap, and we have enjoyed it for over 2 years out by the pool.  however, when on touchless mode, the listening and response of the tap is a bit delayed - so the echo really exceeds expectations.  now i just have to figure out how to configure both with a name so i can play music throughout the house :)waiting for the price of the show to come down a bit, and then i will add that to our home, as well.  alexa, welcome home!!!"
934,7,i like the sound and the music. i did not like that i could not get any music without subscribing to services like amazon prime or spotify.
935,14,there are a lot of issues getting this set up. i got one for my grandpa and we had a hard time getting the system to connect to his phone while following the directions sent with the echo. my dad also got one and it took him an hour to sync it with pandora. if i could do it again i would wait for a product that has worked through these issues.
936,14,"these are addicting.  i got a dot for my birthday, and now can not live without it.  i bought this for our kitchen.  my wife, who does not like gadgets, even appreciates it.  if you get one, you will wonder how you ever got by without it."
937,7,so far so good. seems to be more useful every day.
938,7,nice to have it!
939,14,"love the echo! we actually purchased an earlier version and found it frustrating, so it went back to amazon. this time, they got it right and we are keeping it! alexa is smart and she can hear us from across the room! setup was super simple, too, and i¡¯m not so techy!"
940,14,this thing has been fun and convenient. i have added 3 smart light bulbs. its fun turning on and off my kids lights when they re in their rooms. love the flash briefing. love playing with the star trek sounds. love the music
941,7,"alexa is awesome! she keeps us up on the news, weather, and fulfills all our music needs! great sound"
942,6,i like the improved sound and texturized design. also the price made a difference.
943,14,"it is too early to tell,we are still adjusting to each other."
944,6,it is great but the sound quality could be better
945,6,great size.  it is attractive..  great sound.  very impressed with the subjects it will respond to.
946,14,purchased as a christmas gift. i already have one and the sound is quite nice.
947,7,love the radio feature andi¡¯m still learning all it can do
948,7,did everything i expected.  love the tremendous amount of music it plays.  very happy with the purchase.
949,7,easy set up
950,7,love it
951,7,"we like the sound and her quick response.  do not like that it does not have a battery, must keep it plugged in."
952,4,"received as a gift, satisfied with this gift"
953,14,"i like it. alexa is amazing and has so much potential. they have made so many improvements in such few months. the only thing i do not like is how you can only do certain things with certain music services. but if you want to do everything, you need a separate subscription to amazon music unlimited. there is no need to get the products that have a viewing screen, this product without the screen is better.it sounds great for a 100 dollar speaker."
954,14,"finding new things to try out and do all the time. has made shopping for food and other items very easy , getting all kinds of information or news is just a question away. have tried just a few of the skills that are available and the worked great."
955,7,i love having the new echo and learning all that it can do.
956,7,"great sound, easy to use"
957,7,easy set up
958,6,it can even understand our spanglish. i hope it learns spanish soon.
959,14,its fun! i like that it plays different music channels. but i cannot get it linked to my amazon account because its in another family members name.
960,14,the amazon echo was not what i expected. it did not work right so i returned it
961,7,it is very helpful around the house and the sound is great for music
962,7,best home assistant out there. good sound quality!
963,14,i love my echo!  it is so much fun and was relatively easy to set up. my only problem is it drops off internet easily and will not reconnect until i unplug and reset everything.
964,7,i amm still learning all the features but do like it alot.
965,14,"it has brought music back into my life.... so far that is the best feature, the ease of playing music with a voice command.i wish there was support for other languages, specifically portuguese.i need to spend more time learning some commands to use it for more than just music"
966,6,very responsive and good sound quality.
967,14,"the echo has changed my life. it should be referred to as a life-hack because it is made so many things easier for me throughout the day to news updates, daily reminders, audio playing, and purchases. i highly recommend!"
968,7,this echo has a terrific sound. i listen to music on it all the time. surprised by how well it does sound. i would buy another one of these.
969,7,i love my alexa!! there is not anything i do not like about it. <u+263a>
970,7,"gift from our kids for chrismas...we love it..we play variety of music during the day, every day, give her a thumbs up for longs we like....ask questions, set alarms for meds, wake up to music, set timers, etc....easy to set up, sounds great, alexa makes us laugh.."
971,14,"i love it!!! answers a lot of questions like what will the weather be today but so much more and alexa is getting smarter as time goes by. also plays music which sounds incredible, makes lists, calls to your contacts the list goes on and on."
972,7,love alexis...came quick
973,4,my husband thought it was the best gift he is ever gotten. he really enjoys the instant answers the ability to find what he is looking for
974,6,great
975,14,liked that i could order up a radio station and tell alexa to tun it off in a  hour.
976,7,easy to set up! works great
977,14,"i¡¯m an apple guy, always have been. but alexa is cool, get this and hook up to your wemo is, nest and harmony hub. better than siri by far for accuracy."
978,14,"amazon would be smart to include a big red notice in the echo box that said - do not listen to music until the system updates to the latest version, and include the version number.  the first thing i did was listen to music, and it was terrible,  then i started reading the reviews, and found that it had shipped with a very old version of software, even older than the bad ones that were noted in the reviews in nov 2017. my unit must have been sitting in a warehouse for many months! that said, the sound is reasonable with the new software."
979,7,"alexa is less than perfect and has given me a few ""i do not know"" answers and still has a 'limited' music library.  otherwise, she can be very helpful and often fun.  the improved sound is very nice.  she is learning every day so someday these little things will be fixed."
980,14,very enjoyable.
981,4,"bought this as an xmas gift for our daughter and they love it. my son-in-law works for lutron so they already had lighting control that were compatible with alexa. we also got them a dot for the 2nd floor and they are working well together. seems they learn a new ""trick"" every day."
982,14,she is good but falls a little short on some things i thought she would be able to do.  or maybe the apps that go with her could be a little better user friendly.
983,7,alexa is so easy to setup and a absolute blast to use! wish i would have bought one sooner!!
984,7,"this thing is awesome!! sound, look, quality!! love it."
985,14,we have sonos and google home (orig) both at the house.  i got this to give as a gift for someone at christmas.  i am a google kind of guy so wasnt sure what to expect.  the google home is just so bad as a stand alone speaker that playing music on the echo was like night and day.  if i decided to go echo i could eliminate need for sonos speakers altogether.as for other features i can only speak to the hue light setup which was very straight forward.definitely worth trying if you are not hard core google like me ;)
986,7,the sound is outstanding. i ask it daily for a weather report. the music sound is outstanding.
987,4,"bought it for a friend and hey love it. never thought of buying it for themselves, now wish they had it sooner."
988,7,gorgeous
989,7,she really does not listen well a lot. but i will give it more time
990,7,the echo was so simple to setup and the sound is really great.
991,4,bought it as a gift for my son. he is very happy with it.
992,7,"i love the echo. the speaker is awesome.  when you play music, it sounds like a bose system.  the only downside is that you have to ask the questions correctly for it to understand what you want.  it is a learning curve, but i am really enjoying it.  my son and his girlfriend sent it to me for christmas."
993,7,we love the music...so much fun
994,7,i love it works very good and it is loud
995,6,the echo second generation the sound is not as clear louud like 10 level..function great..
996,7,i love it.
997,7,i found out i enjoy finding out things about what happened on that day from the past and other people things special things about the day
998,7,love it! i gave it as a gift to my boyfriend and it is so useful in our everyday lives.  great to listen to music. there is so much alexa can do.
999,14,"set up was horrible! i got this as a christmas gift took over an hr to play something out of it, plus u need to have premium subscriptions to use any ofthe apps,"
