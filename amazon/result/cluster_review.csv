0,14,"so it is been an interesting first few weeks with the echo and am happy to say echo 2nd gen has finally delivered on its promise of improved sound quality over 1st gen echo, with the 3rd firmware since launch.  if you are confused about a lot of the negative reviews, old firmware is the likely cause of most of them regarding poor sound quality.want to keep this short and spare all the gory details, but there was a bug in the launch version of the firmware, which was fixed after a few days, but the first fix, while satisfying some, was not, in my opinion a full fix and left the mid-range frequencies muted and tinny.  today i noticed that alexa is voice in this unit sounded much more like alexa is voice on gen 1 echo is i own and, after playing some music, suspected they had upgraded the firmware again, and indeed they have.  the current firmware is 592452720 and it is a massive improvement over both the original and updated version 592452420.so i decided to do some more side-by-side comparisons with the gen 1 echo and can honestly say in many areas the sound quality is now actually better than gen 1 echo.  this is how the product should have sounded at launch! if i have any complaints at this point it is that the low-frequencies loudness could stand to be bumped up just a tad.  (better yet, please add an eq feature to the alexa app so users can adjust eq for the room and music type they prefer).  i did my comparisons at volume level 8.  anything above that and gen 1 echo dynamic range starts to break down, while gen 2 maintains quality but does not get quite as loud and gen 1.  it is the right trade off, i would rather it sound good than be louder and sound harsh.  at that volume level i went thru a range of music, streamed over bluetooth, switching between gen 1 and gen 2 devices, and found gen 2 to be an improvement over gen 1 for the vast majority of the music i tried.  i¡¯m impressed with the quality of the audio coming out of this form factor, and impressed how quickly amazon has responded to feedback on the problems. kudos, this echo is a keeper."
1,14,"---------------------------update 11/4/2017---------------------------after all the negative reviews and feedback on the poor sound quality of the 2nd generation echo it appears that amazon has taken quick steps to help remedy the issue.  i spoke with an amazon representative on the phone who confirmed that there has been a software update which is rolling out to echo devices.  after getting the update my echo does indeed sound better!  i still would not call it audiophile-quality by any means, but the bass is fuller and the sound is less ""tinny"" overall.to check which software version you have, select ""settings"" on your alexa phone app, choose your echo device, then scroll down the page to where it says ""device software version.""  the updated version (as of 11/4/17) is 592452420 (previously it was 592452320).you do not have to do anything to get the update; it will be sent automatically by amazon.  you may see the indicator light on your echo will pulse blue as the update is installed.  the representative i spoke with said you may get it more quickly by not using your echo for several hours.  i hit the mute button on mine and received the update within a few hours.  i am very impressed by amazon is quick response to this issue!-----------------------------original review-----------------------------as a very happy owner of three echo dots (2nd generation) i was glad to see amazon release a 2nd generation of the echo as well.  after using it for several days i can say i am quite pleased with it, and even though it does not have any radical new features compared with the 1st generation echo or the echo dot, there are some notable improvements.  i will summarize these differences first and then describe the new echo in a bit more detail.improvements over the echo 1st generation:- more color and texture choices- a swappable outer shell- ability to output audio to another device or stereo system via bluetooth or an auxiliary cable- dolby-powered speakers- significantly lower price!differences from the echo dot (2nd gen):- larger size and swappable outer shell (these are probably obvious)- 2 speakers (tweeter and woofer) vs. 1- power adapter sits flatter against the wall---------------------------overall appearance---------------------------i purchased the ""heather gray fabric"" version.  the cloth is a polyester woven fabric made up of lighter and darker shades of gray which certainly gives it more visual interest than if it were just a solid, uniform gray.  the neutral color blends in with nearly any decor, and the cloth gives it a softer look which is great for areas of your house where you do not want something that screams ""i am a device!""in terms of size, the echo 2nd generation is almost the same diameter (3.5"") as the 1st generation echo (3.3""), but it is several inches shorter.  to me the original echo looked like a tower; this shorter version is much less ostentatious.the top of the device is identical to the 2nd gen echo dot: it has four buttons (volume up, volume down, microphone off, and an ""action"" button), a multi-colored light ring around the edge that tells you about the echo is status, and seven tiny holes below which the microphones sit.a new feature of this echo is its swappable decorative shell.  simply press a button on the underside of the device and the shell slides right off, allowing you to replace it with any of the other shells that amazon sells.  i am not sure how many people will take advantage of this feature given that additional shells are $20-30, but it could be useful if you want to change your echo is look to match a different location in your home.a final note on appearance: the power adapter for the echo sits fairly flat against the wall, protruding maybe 1.5"".  by contrast, the dot is adapter sticks out from the wall 2-3 inches.  the flatter adapter of the echo is nice if you want to plug it into an outlet that is behind a piece of furniture.--------------------audio quality--------------------i did a side-by-side comparison of the 1st and 2nd generation echos, and despite the new dolby-powered speakers i did not notice a significant difference in sound quality with either music or spoken text.  i certainly would not call it ""room filling sound"" in any case.  clarity is not bad, but bass is nearly non-existent.  however, the real potential improvement in sound quality comes not from the speakers themselves but from a new feature for 2nd generation echo devices: using bluetooth or a 3.5mm auxiliary cable (not included), you can play the audio through a nearby speaker or stereo system.  yes, this does means you are using two devices to accomplish one thing, but in a sense it is no different than plugging any other sound source into your stereo system.  to be honest, i do not generally think of the echo primarily as a music playback device anyway other than for very casual listening (but i realize that puts me in a minority... admittedly i am a bit of an audiophile).compared with the echo dot, however, there is a noticeable difference in sound.  this should not be a surprise given that the echo has two speakers (a tweeter and a woofer) while the dot has only one.  to my ear the difference is not so much in clarity but rather in fullness.  with two speakers and a bit more acoustic ""heft,"" the echo is sound has more presence than the dot is, which to me makes it more tolerable to listen to for a period of time.  the difference is even more appreciable with music than with newscasts or other spoken text.-------------------------voice recognition-------------------------this is one area where i must confess i am disappointed.  like the 2nd generation of the dot, the echo 2nd generation uses seven microphones beneath its top surface to recognize voice commands spoken from any direction.  my wife and i both found this echo to be slightly less proficient at detecting our voices and recognizing vocal commands than our dots are.  we did side-by-side comparisons of the echo and the dot in several locations around our house and the dot was nearly always better at picking up our voices (and yes, we only had one plugged in at a time!).  i am not sure why this would be since both devices use similar technology, but the difference was pretty consistent.  one possible explanation i can think of is this: both devices have their microphone openings on their top surfaces, effectively pointing upward.  because the echo is taller than the dot, if you put both devices side by side and speak to them from several feet away, your voice will hit the dot is microphones at a slightly more downward (i.e., direct) angle than the echo is, which may help the dot pick up your voice better.  obviously i am only speculating here, but in support of this theory i have noticed that both devices have difficulty detecting my voice if i speak from below them (for example, if i am sitting on the floor and the device is on a table).-------------------functionality-------------------the bottom line is that overall functionality -- what the echo 2nd generation ""does"" -- is nearly identical to the 1st generation echo and the dot.  keep in mind that the alexa assistant software on which all echos operate is run on amazon is cloud, not your individual device.  this means that as amazon adds features to alexa they automatically become available on all echo devices.  so, you can use any of them to:- stream music via wifi from multiple sources- control smart home devices- make hands-free calls to other echo devices or phone numbers in north america- make purchases from your amazon prime account- listen to news feeds, podcasts, etc.- do anything else in alexa is ever-growing skill set, such as make shopping lists, set timers/alarms/reminders, play games, tell you your daily schedule, and any other skills amazon dreams up for alexa in the future.personally i have two favorite alexa skills: the flash briefing and the drop-in feature.  the flash briefing is fully customizable daily ""digest"" of news and other information which you can hear any time by asking ""what is my flash briefing?""  there is a huge list of content you can add to your briefing including news updates, weather forecasts, sports and traffic updates, and educational snippets along with many that are just humorous or entertaining.  using the alexa phone app or your echo account page you can select exactly what content you want in your briefing and in what order you want to hear it.  for example, i configured mine with npr news, bbc news, the weather, and a word of the day.  i love having an on-demand synopsis of the latest news from my favorite sources.my other favorite feature, ""drop in,"" essentially opens a two-way communication channel between any two echo devices, sort of like an intercom.  simply ask alexa to ""drop in on [the living room, the kitchen...]"" and you are instantly connected.  my wife and i use this feature all the time when we need to communicate from opposite ends of the house.  you can turn drop-in capability on or off for each of your echo devices individually, and you can also choose whether each device can drop in with any echo device or only those in your own home.[note that the drop-in feature is not the same thing as alexa is hands-free calling feature.  hands-free calling allows you to call most phone numbers and echo devices in the u.s., mexico, and canada from your echo by saying your contact is name or number.  just like with a phone call, the other person must choose to answer your call before you can communicate.  by contrast, with the drop-in feature communication is instantly established.  for this reason you will probably want to use drop-in only with your closest family and friends, and probably only for certain rooms in your home!] -----------------------------------a few (minor) complaints-----------------------------------unfortunately the echo 2nd gen shares an annoying trait of the echo dot: widely varying volume levels within the daily flash briefing.  as you listen to the briefing, some components (such as one america news) come through quietly while others (like fox news) are much louder.  i do not know whether this variability is due to differences in how each component of the feed is produced or whether it has to do with the device itself, but in any case i hoped the phenomenon would be less pronounced with the 2nd generation echo than it is with the dot.  unfortunately, it is not.  just be prepared to adjust the volume at the beginning of each segment.another complaint i have is the inability to listen to certain feeds outside of the flash briefing.  one america news is an example here: you can listen to the channel is live feed any time, but you can only hear the channel is ""top stories summary"" as part of your flash briefing.  this issue is probably more software than device related, but still, it bugs me.--------------a few tips--------------1) the echo seems to pick up voices best when placed at or below eye level (i.e., roughly the level from which your voice emits).  mine has trouble detecting voices coming from below it, so i do not recommend placing this on a high shelf.2) when you select news feeds for your flash briefing i recommend picking one u.s. source and one international source (i use npr and bbc - both are excellent).  if you add too many feeds you will get a lot of overlap and hear the same story several times.3) if you have multiple echo devices in your home, sometimes speaking to one will cause others to respond as well, especially if they are in close proximity (like in adjacent rooms).  one way to prevent this is to change the wake word of one of the devices to ""echo"" or ""amazon.""  the only downside is that you then have to remember which wake word you assigned to each device!4) some speakers have a bit of a ""burn-in"" period, so in an attempt to improve my echo is sound i left it playing music for much of the first few days i had it.  the sound did seem to improve a little, (the lower frequencies filled in some), but it is still not stellar.  but if you are not happy with the sound at first, let it play frequently for a few days and it may improve a bit.--------------------------which one to buy?--------------------------if you are trying to decide between the echo and the dot, think carefully about how you plan to use the device.  the single biggest practical difference between the two is that the echo has fuller, better quality sound.  so if you plan to use the device mostly for listening to music, news, podcasts, or whatever, you will probably appreciate the echo is better acoustics.  on the other hand, if you want to use it mainly for voice control of smart home devices, the dot is more than sufficient.  i have a dot in our home theater room that i use exclusively to control the lights in that room.  for that type of single-purpose application anything more than a dot would be overkill.==========bottom line==========although the echo 2nd generation may not have any earth-shattering new features compared with the 1st generation, its significantly lower price and ability to send music to another speaker or stereo system make it a winner.  if you already own a 1st generation echo there probably is not a compelling reason to upgrade because the difference in sound quality is not significant.  but if this is your first echo device you will probably be very pleased with it.  and if you are deciding between the echo and the dot, which one you purchase comes down to how you want to use the device.  for heavy listening, the echo may be preferable for its better acoustics; otherwise, the dot is a great deal -- especially at half the price of the echo!"
2,14,"update: amazon has pushed a software update and sound quality now sounds great.i was originally disappointed in the 2nd gen as my original review (below) shows.  shortly after posting the review amazon reached out to me for additional information.  they contacted me again today and said they took my, and others, feedback regarding the sound quality seriously.  the amazon rep informed me my echo was selected to be part of a test group asked me if i would want to install a new software update to address the problem.  she walked me through the steps to ensure the update was applied and asked me to test the audio (she stayed on the phone while i did this).with my 2nd gen and original 1st gen echo in a multi-room group (that is a really nice feature) i had alexa fire up my playlist.  i was surprised to find the 2nd gen now sounded much improved.  as i walked between rooms with the two echo is i was also surprised that the 2nd gen sounded better than my 1st gen, the bass and mid-range had a better quality.  not believing my own ears i had my wife also give it a listen and she agreed.the amazon rep said they were working with a small group of customers like me to verify the update and they would be pushing the update to all customers very soon (update to my update, looks like amazon is now pushing out the software broadly!).  you can check your software version by using the alexa app and looking at your echo device settings. fyi, after the update my gen2 shows device software version 592452420 (the original was 592452320).other than audio, the gen 2 is nearly identical to the original gen 1 with exception of form factor.  the gen 2 is shorter (5.9"") and wider (3.5"").  for comparison gen 1 was 9.2"" x 3.3"".  the gen 2 has many 'skin' options, i chose the fabric option. comparatively the gen 1 had a look of plastic and metal.  the gen 2 cover is removable so you can replace with other skins.as for responsiveness, gen 2 specs show better microphone array.  from my use i have not noticed anything improved. that said i was very happy with the gen 1 responsiveness to commands, the gen 2 continues to be as responsive.all other functions seem to be the same as gen 1 including blue ring that indicates ""listening"", buttons on top to activate for ""alexa"" and button to mute the microphone array. there is also a 3.5mm jack port and bluetooth to connect to other speakers. there is a design change, with gen 1 you would turn the ring to change volume, that is been replaced with +/- buttons (following same design change as the dot releases).---[original review - 1 star]---i bought my first amazon echo back in 2014.  since then i have added a second echo (1st gen), a tap and 3 dots.  i have added vaux cordless home speaker<u+00a0>vaux cordless home speaker + portable battery for amazon echo dot gen 2 gray/ash<u+00a0>to two of my dots.  i have given echo as gifts.  in other words i am all in on amazon echo system and have been for a long time.amazon advertises this as 2nd generation as ""improved sound"".  i thought the original echo (1 gen) sounded great so i fell for the 2nd gen hook, line and sinker.  unfortunately after listening to it i find it is a sinker indeed, or perhaps a stinker.i did an informal test with my 1st gen and new 2nd gen echo.  i had them both play a set of songs.  i am just going by what my set of ears tells me, but the 2nd gen is disappointing when it comes to sound quality.  while it does seem to have a deeper bass, the overall quality sounds tinnier than the 1st gen.  whatever ""powered by dolby"" is supposed to bring to the 2nd get unit is not much, this 2nd gen is just not up to par with the original when it comes to audio.the unit otherwise functions like the original and other than the form factor i see nothing that is an improvement.  i have not seen that it ""hears"" better.  and it does not sound better for sure.perhaps i am too focused on the sound of echo 2nd gen, but when amazon makes it a point to expressly market it as being ""improved sound"", i would expect the sound to be noticeably improved. it does not and therefore give it a 1 star rating."
3,7,"i love my echo, it is stylish, loud<f0><u+009f><u+0094><u+008a>, has very nice bass. it comes with everything you need to get started and so simple to sit up. in other words this one is a keeper. the new echo is awesome."
4,14,"sound is not great. a review of the echo as a music speaker.we are new echo users and have never owned the 1st generation products. we have two 2nd gen dots and one of the new echos. while the echo sounds better than the dots, it is inferior to even mid range bluetooth speakers. i understand it is not supposed to be a stand alone speaker but amazon touted this as ""dynamic bass throughout the room."" not even close. the low end is not very good and the sound starts to distort at max  volumes. my comparisons are based two older model speakers, jbl charge 2 and bose mini while listening to classic rock, pop and classical music.all other features work as advertised."
5,14,"i¡¯ve had my echo 2 for over a week now. it is our 8th alexa product, but our first full size echo. we have several dots throughout the house, some with auxiliary speakers and some not. the echo sound quality is far superior to any of them, including those with auxiliary speakers, and speech pickup is very good. i placed this echo in a large room where the acoustics are challenging. dots placed there in the past had great difficulty hearing and understanding commands, but the echo has performed flawlessly. we are so pleased, i¡¯m planning to order several more to replace some of our dots. we are also very pleased with the look of this new echo. the interchangeable sleeve is very classy looking and blends well into our decor."
6,14,"<u+00a0>my mother is 84 years old and she struggles talking on a cell phone, and i struggle to hear her. she kept bumping the cell phone up against her chin, and when i talked to her i hear numerous beeps when we are talking like someone was dialing out. she is having trouble holding the cell phone up to her head. i talked my mom in to getting an amazon echo as a gift from me. my sister helped to set it up since i am in another state. when you make a call with the echo, it uses the phone number associated with the cell phone that is on your amazon account. so i changed that to my mothers cell number. so when she makes a call, it shows up as her cell phone number on the caller id. now all she has to do is say ""alexa call greg"", and the echo dials me up, and anyone in her contact list. she rests comfortably in her easy chair, and she can hear everything i say through the echo, and i can hear everything my mother says very clearly. she can also ask alexa to dial any number, that is very helpful as well. this feature alone was well worth the price of buying an amazon echo. my mother is learning very quickly all the other skills alexa is able to do, weather, music, audiobooks, trivia questions, etc. now that i am able to talk to my mother with ease.i would have to say this is the best gadget i have ever bought on amazon.attached is a voice mail from my mother, and how much she loves the amazon echo"
7,14,"sorry to report this (along with the others i am seeing in the initial reviews) - the echo 2nd gen sound is not as good as the original. bass seems to be cut off at the low end, midrange is weak, lots of emphasis on the high end, overall fidelity seems to be reduced. odd that it is been advertised as ""improved sound"" and ""bose"". i thought this might just be true at low volume, but listened again this morning, running the volume up, and there is a cutoff on the low bass at high volume, too. at the least, it should auto-compensate with volume level - higher bass at lower volume, etc.i think that there is going to be enough static from users that amazon should just admit the problem, pull back the echo 2 now, fix the issue, & replace these first units with revised ones. i wonder who did the beta-testing? the unit is certainly heavy enough to have a large bass speaker magnet .. maybe this can be fixed in software - can amazon update echo equalization via wifi? are the speakers actually high quality?and - they have removed the ""ring"" volume control on top (retaining both the +/- buttons and the voice-activated incremental controls). i only use the ring control on my echo 1 - it is not ""stepped"" - i can set an exact volume.  i miss it already.while we are here, how about fixing things so that all sound intensities (volumes) are the same? alexa is voice, music across the genres, books being read by alexa or by audible folks, ""drop-in"" and ordinary phone calls - fix this so that all have the same sound intensity. as it is now, the drop-in calls are much louder than alexa is voice, for example. also, add a good tone equalizer control within the alexa app while you are at it. and - how about a speed control for alexa is voice when she is reading a book? lots of other text-to-speech gadgets have it - it is a necessity for older folks like my mother (for whom the echo is a great life-enhancer).finally - adding potential injury to insult - who decided to ship the entire batch of pre-orders to be dropped on doorsteps on halloween night? the goblins approach a home but no one is there, see a nice ""treat"" in the big amazon box, and, poof! - magically gone! amazon staff need access to a calendar showing halloween in big orange letters. the preorders were not even supposed to ship until nov. 1.on the plus side: the microphones are probably even better - i can ask alexa to stop or increase volume even while playing very loud music. amazing!  plus, i like the gray cloth cover. and, all of the usual things work very well, including the new ""call any phone by just asking alexa to do it"" feature. it does, in fact, allow calls to phones in the u.s. and canada (and probably mexico) for free. very nice.amazon - just fix the sound, return my sound control ring, put an equalizer in the alexa app and we will be fine. but - do not wait! you are going to have a lot of returns on this one; will probably lose momentum to the competition.i will return my echo 2 and have already ordered its replacement - an echo first gen that was still available on a competitor is site. i do like the echo - a lot! ... just not the 2."
8,14,"i was very exited about trying out the new echo 2nd generation.  after all, i was cautious and did not buy the 1st generation but after seeing all the reviews about the it is decided it is time to get mine. i waited to buy the 2nd gen as like anyone else the ad said it will be improved quality on the 1st generation.i was pleasantly surprised when i heard the music play.  it did not sound as good as they tried to sell it. poor quality from the music though alexa is voice is sharp and crisp. the voice control is very responsive even from my other room which is impressive.  all the functions performed exceptional for me except the music playback which was the most important feature i wanted. i planned on buying the 3 pack for the entire home, but that is on hold unless there is significant audio improvement."
9,14,"mixed feelings about this echo - as a gen 1 owner i certainly expected much more.  on the day i received this i compared my gen 1 and gen 2 echos side by side using different wake words.  the sound from the original was much better - especially at higher volumes.  however, the microphone is better on this gen 2 - i was able to whisper the wake work from a few feet away and it responded, while the gen 1 echo did not.  also, i have a few echos and dots in my home and this one is better at responding when it is the closest device.  with the gen 1, i could be 10 feet away from it and 20 feet away from a dot in another room and the dot would respond.  but now the gen 1 responds - as it should.as for the design - i do like the smaller form factor of the gen 2.  unfortunately for me, i keep this device on a ledge between rooms and the jack is now very visible.  on the gen 1, the jack is on the bottom of the unit, on the gen 2 it is on the back.  overall, i am going to keep this, but think it could have been designed a bit better - both in sound and looks."
10,14,the first wave of units shipped had an equalizer problem and sounded awful!  i preordered my walnut woodgrain echo and it arrived a couple days after the non-woodgrain echos.  while reading the reviews for the two days before mine arrived i was nervous!  it seemed like most people hated this new 2nd generation echo.  mine finally arrived and it too sounded terrible!  after a few hours of not using it the update downloaded and all the sudden it sounded great!  the speaker has broken in and it actually has bass!  i waited awhile to leave my review to make sure i really liked this echo.  i went to a big box store and listened to some other bluetooth speakers and this echo blows all of them away (even two bose speakers that i tried but maybe the floor models were abused).  the walnut grain is really nice and looks rich.  it goes with my room decor really well.  one of my most used features on the echo is the nature sounds for sleeping.  there are some great rain sounds that you can put on loop while you sleep!  i also hook up the echo to my tablet so the sound comes out of the echo instead of the tablets dinky speakers.  watching youtube with the echo as my speaker has been great!  i will be buying another one eventually.  i have two echo dots also.  one of the dots is hooked up to klipsch speakers on a stereo system and the sound is obviously much better but for the size of this echo you really can not beat the sound.  bottome line: do not let the bad reviews sway you away from this thing.  amazon is return policy is the best so at least give it a try and see what you think.  i am super picky about everything and i could not be happier with this device.
11,14,"i just bought this new model for a room which belonged to my late wife and which has not been used for almost 3 years.  it is quite remote from the rest of the house, so it deserves it is own echo.  this is my 6th echo in a 2,400 sq ft (2 floor) house.  i bought the original echo two years ago then added 4 dots to that and now this handsome new echo.  they all function independently and together (music everywhere !! ... without latency issues).  i probably use all of them for ""smart home"" control (more commands than any other type) of 9 wemo switches, a nest thermostat, and a nexx garage door controller.  i now live alone and it is an extra feeling of security to be able to turn on lights in the house when arriving home after dark.  i have an extra loud doorbell (not wifi controlled) which i would not be able to hear in this newly remodeled room under any circumstances...so my next smart home addition will likely be a wifi (alexa controlled) doorbell (incl. video camera).  my dots all have accompanying jbl bluetooth speakers (however, they are hard wired due to the limitation on bluetooth in a shared network, i.e. ""music everywhere"" only works if speakers are internal or hard wired).  i do not find this to be a big deal.  i am glad that they are bluetooth speakers for travel purposes, but that is not necessary on a day to day basis.  however, i really like the sound of this new unit...it may be just a touch better than the original ""large"" echo (both are superb for the intended purpose).  in this new office and for casual listening the internal speaker is plenty good.  if i ""require"" serious listening, i can play the sound through my media system or high-end stereo speakers if necessary.  i also use alexa for information, stock market reports, flash briefings, frequently for time information when i can not see a clock, and for weather reports.  all of my married children have dots (which i gave them for christmas in 2016), so we are going to be working on setting up telephonic connections very soon.  for me alexa is a voice in an otherwise silent house...a side benefit.  over these past two years she has acquired many skills, but i am not sure she is any smarter with regard to interpreting my statements to her or wishes of her.  but what i do appreciate is that for tasks she performs i do not have to memorize a script to use her.  she responds to natural speech well enough to control all those things i wish to control."
12,14,"[11/20/2017 update] the echo 2 periodically loses its connection to spotify connect. it just vanishes from the list of available devices in the spotify app. my 1st gen echo and tap are not affected and they are on the same wifi network and near the echo 2. it is still online and i can still say, ""alexa, play playlist <name> on spotify>. the problem seems isolated to the spotify app itself. this could be a problem that spotify has to fix but it is annoying enough to be a reason to hold off on buying an echo 2 if you regularly connect to your echo through spotify connect. unplugging the echo 2 and plugging it back in sometimes fixes the connection problem, but not always.[11/4/2017 update] i got the firmware update - the alexa app now shows the software version as a number ending in 5420 (formerly 5320). i noticed a big improvement in the bass and overall richness. it is really quite good now. i really did not expect them to be able to fix this through software, and i appreciate amazon getting it out so fast! i was getting my box ready to return it.[previous 1-star review, based on poor audio quality in the echo 2 unit i received october 31st]i pre-ordered it specifically because amazon promised improved audio. i could not believe it - it sounds the same, if not worse, than the gen 1. echo. i spent a good hour doing side by side comparisons on a variety of songs, echo 1 vs. echo 2, and the echo 1 was the winner on every single one. the echo 2 sounds flat and hollow, especially at lower volumes!this is the same disappointment i felt after buying a tap. i do not think amazon knows what a good speaker sounds like.everything else is as-advertised, though, so i feel like it is probably too harsh to give it a 1 star rating, but i only bought it because of the promise of improved audio (i already have an alexa device in every room)."
13,14,"***update 11/4/17:  i wish i had not raised my review to 5 stars yesterday, because i got the firmware update that other reviewers have commented on last night on 2 of my 3 new echoes (version 592452420), and i would like to be able to bump it up another star now that i have. these speakers sound great for their size, better than the original echo. and they are definitely a great speaker at the $99 price point (and an even better deal if you get them cheaper). it is unfortunate that these speakers did not ship with this version of the software. it would have saved amazon a lot of returns. i am glad i had faith that amazon would fix it, because they certainly did.***update 11/3/17: raising my review to 5 stars from 3. the more i listen to the new echo, the more i like the sound when playing music (perhaps my ears are just getting habituated to them? perhaps, but the sound really does seem to be richer than when they came out of the box). these speakers sound is just very different than the first generation. as you can see from reviews so far, those of us who had the first generation echo have been unusually harsh, while those who are just buying this echo as their first full echo product generally love it. i think it is all about expectations.<u+2014>-11/2/17: i purchased the three-pack of the all-new echo because i wanted to grow my family of echo products now that amazon allows for multi-room audio syncing, which already included 3 of the original echoes as well as an echo dot that i have hooked up to the klipsch 2.1 promedia speakers via a line-in connection.i think my impression of the new version of the echo is in line with some reviews i have read online from some of the tech magazines, which is that the audio quality seems to be a step down from the original echo rather than an improvement. the instrumental parts of a song get muddied together while the vocals get pushed forward a bit too much, and the bass is much weaker than it is with the original echo. however, the size and looks of this speaker is a huge improvement over the original echo (and it actually makes me much more aware of how ugly the grill on the original echo really is [unfortunately, this had to be preserved on the non-cloth shells of the new echo).that said, i noticed that the more i listened to one of the new speakers over a few hours, i started to notice that i was appreciating the sounds more. i am not sure if my ear was just habituating to the speaker or if the speaker has a bit of a break-in period. but, when i went back to one of the other new speakers that has not been used much, i still noted a difference.i will also say that when i bought my first original echo, i was likewise not very happy with the sound (and i had similar complaints). yet, over time, the speaker seemed to sound better, and i eventually decided to buy two more on prime day last year. i think that amazon regularly updates the software on their products, and i believe that they tweaked some of the eq on the original echo to make it sound better (however, i can not find any documentation to back that up; i have found the latest tap update specifically says it was partially made to improve the bass on that speaker).overall, i would probably give this four stars if the ""improved"" sound had not been so hyped, only to see that they sound worse to me. i am still impressed by alexa and the ease with which i can play pretty much any music i want just by asking for it via amazon music unlimited. i also love the multi-room audio feature. i would love to see the ability to pair two speakers in a stereo mode, but just being able to sync them at all is pretty great for now. i also love the fact that amazon appears committed to adding useful features, such as the ability to make voice calls with a simple voice prompt, which i have really appreciated when i am trying to take care of my 8-month old.i will update my review as i use these speakers more, particularly if i notice any improvement in audio quality."
14,14,"i purchased a 3 pack of the new echo to get the $50.00 discount special. i had read other reviews where folks were not happy with the sound quality of the speaker during music playback. i must admit that after i set up the first unit and played some music i would tend to agree. flat base and a bit washed out over all. but wait!!  there is good news. as i set up the second and third echos the first unit that had been set up for 10 minutes or so said, ""i am updating, i will be available shortly"". one by one each speaker received an update from amazon and i have no idea how but after updating they sound ""amazing"" full, rich base, excellent vocals and overall sounds as good as my jbl or ue boom. if you are thinking of getting these but were afraid after reading the not so great sound quality reviews, go ahead. you will be more than pleased after receiving the updated software. aaaaa+++++ and the ""play everywhere"" effect sounds amazing."
15,11,"great things to say about my 2nd gen. first the smaller design is definitely a plus, multiple color options is great and the sound so much better. i do feel that the 2nd gen is a little slower at responding then the first. hopefully, the more we use it the faster the response time is. my 1st gen is definitely still part of the family and being used in our family room. we only had one issue with our 1st gen and that was the power cord went out after almost 2 years. either way i love my echoes!"
16,14,"update on january 17, 2018: it seems that two out of the three that i purchased developed a problem where they would drop the internet connection and setup memory needing to be re-setup constantly. the replacements work great. i am keeping my rating at four stars for now because the quality of the audio and ease of use is great on the replacement devices and definitely deserve the four stars.i bought three of the 2nd generation echo is as christmas gifts. i saw the setting up of two of the units and i did notice some differences between the two. one device set up quickly and easily but the second device kept on constantly dropping the internet connection and thus would not respond when given simple instructions or asked simple questions.after looking through the support pages and spending some time on the phone with customer support, the issue continued so i initiated an exchange. the replacement echo arrived within one day which was nice since i was still in the process of shipping back the failed unit. the replacement echo that arrived was able to be set up quickly and easily and works perfectly. interestingly though, the new device seems more responsive than the first echo that was initially set up. the first echo is sitting in the living room and the second (new) device is about twenty feet away up the stairs on the second floor. when we give a command to the device in the living room, the echo on the second floor often responds before the echo in the living room. this is not a big deal but does show a slight difference between the two devices. i am impressed by how both echo is are able to hear commands even when spoken to softly.so far, we have used the echo is for basic tasks like playing music from spotify or sirius radio, and basic questions such as the weather or for definitions of words. they have worked great for those purposes.in the future, we plan on incorporation a few smart devices to expand what we can do with the units.the only thing that i think would make the echo better would be to add the ability to play sound out of both the echo and an additional speaker at the same time while connected via bluetooth. currently, we can easily add a bluetooth speaker but it will only play sound out of the connected speaker and not both the speaker and the echo at the same time.all in all, the echo is are nice devices with very good sound for such small devices."
17,14,"edit - updates comments on 11/21/2017:after my initial review (see below these updated comments) expressing my disappointment in the echo 2.0 product and it is poor initial sound quality, to their credit, someone from amazon actually phoned me and told me they acknowledged the problem and were issuing a software update to ""cure"" the problem.  i was out of town and unable to actually use my echo 2.0 that week, so i was curious to see how it sounded when i got back.  it does indeed sound much better, and since then i believe a second software update was sent out.  due to this major improvement, i will be changing my rating from two stars to three.  if they can improve the sound even more through further updates, or take some other action to further satisfy me, i will consider raising it to four stars, but honestly, i am still smarting from my initial experience right out of the box where my jaw dropped in horror at the sound quality.  that was not an experience i am likely to forget about anytime soon.just yesterday i had time to actually listen to a few favorite songs on the unit.  it definitely has more bass than before, and sounds vastly better than it did initially.  that being said, and i noticed this from the beginning, there is split second ""crackle"" in the speaker when playing music ever minute or two.  it is not a deal breaker most likely, but it is definitely disturbing and disappointing to hear this since it does happenfrequently.i am not a perfectionist when it comes to audio, but i think my issue with this product, and i would guess many others, is that amazon prominently mentioned ""improved sound"" when introducing echo 2.0....and it is not.  regardless how ""acceptable"" the sound is now with the two software updates.....it is still not better than the original echo 1.0, which i have had for 18 months and from the start thought has an amazingly rich sound quality.in case anyone from amazon is reading this, the lesson i would take from this is, do not ever promise more than you can deliver.  while i would have found the echo 2.0 lacking in the sound quality area regardless, what made me more disappointed, and yes, even a bit angry, is how you point blank advertised ""improved sound quality"", which is clearly is not.....so far anyway.  if you can do further software updates or other methods to improve the sound....kudos to you, but either way, out of the box, you dropped the ball on this one.to be fair, amazon has provided me with excellent service over the 7 years i have been dealing with them.  i have had them go over the top in taking good care of me on more than a few occasions, and i want to acknowledge that up front.  this is just one case where they definitely did not meet or exceed my expectations.original review below:i am so disappointed!  i have had one original echo (1st generarion) for about 18 month and found the sound to be amazing.  i have purchased two dots since then and hooked up to bluetooth speakers which makes them sound fine.  i was so excited about the echo 2.0 with the ""improved sound"" when amazon announced it.  i received it a few days ago and am totally disappointed in the audio quality.i cannot imagine who at amazon thinks this is ""improved sound"" over the original echo.echo 2.0 looks good.....but the audio quality is awful....period!amazon, for the first time ever you have let me down.  i feel you mislead me and thousands of others with the marketing claim of ""improved audio"" in echo 2.0.make it right, however you decide to do it, just make it right.  perhaps offer to refund half the cost to all purchasers since it sounds closer to the sound quality of dot rather than echo 1.0."
18,11,extremely disappointed with the sound quality. this will be returned and i just ordered the 1st generation echo that sounds a lot richer.
19,14,sound not good at all my jbl bluetooth speaker sounds better than this... update on review for those having issues with sound here are the steps to resolve. press and hold the microphone off and volume down buttons at the same time until the light ring turns orange (about 20 seconds). then the light ring will turn blue.2. wait for the light ring to turn off and on again. the light ring will then turn orange again as your device enters setup mode.3. open the alexa app to connect your device to a wi-fi network and register it to your amazon ac
20,14,"really can not find a use of this device without incurring the cost of various monthly services, ie music services, cloud storage services, or buying home automation devices, etc. it sits unplugged on a table supporting a thermometer that has a broken easel support. ads should make it clear it does very little without buying something else. for example, it will not "" alexa, play a song by the beatles"" unless you have a beatles playlist stored in the cloud or subscribe to amazon is music service."
21,14,"i was expecting a lot more with this 2nd generation echo, but sadly it does not deliver. despite the fact that it apparently has larger/better dolby speakers, the sound is not anywhere near the quality of the 1st generation echo. i did some research and there are unpublished commands to turn up the bass/midrange/treble (alexa turn up the bass for example), but i still could not get the sound quality to be as crisp and clear as my original echo. the new 2nd gen echo sounds a bit muffled and does not have the treble of the previous model. the bass is slightly deeper and punchier but again the lack of highs and muffled sound have resulted in this echo being installed in my office which is about a 12' x 12' room and us keeping the original echo where it was."
22,11,"i waited to purchase this based on the ¡°improved¡± sound they were advertising. i knew the first generation sounded good so i was excited to wait for this one. what a disappointing purchase this was. although the price point was good, the sound has absolutely no bass of any kind what so ever. if you¡¯re thinking of purchasing for sound quality, go with the first generation or the echo plus.upate: a new software version was put out and the improved sound is great. thank you. updated to 5 stars"
23,14,"i just received an echo for my birthday.  after setup, i was able to play many of the songs i enjoyed in the 50s and 60s.  now, four days later, alexa will not play any of these songs and keeps asking me to pay for amazon music unlimited ($3.99/month).  what changed?  i am an amazon prime member.  i remember seeing something that said amazon provided 2 million free songs and that i only had to pay if i wanted access to 10 million.  now it seems that i have to pay to listen to any song.update:  i received a call from amazon support within 30 minutes of posting this review.  support discovered that my echo had switched to my wife is profile and support did not know why it switched.  you can say ""alexa, what profile?""  and say ""alexa, switch profile"" if your echo is mis-identified and acting strange like mine.  i am updating my review to 5 stars as i have listened to more songs in a few days than i listened to in the previous year.  asking alexa for a song, a singer, a song category makes listening super easy."
24,14,"i waited after the launch and seeing all the bad reviews. i was looking forward to this new gen echo but the initial response was not good, because f the sound.to cut to the chase, this really is better than the first gen.  i still have the first gen which i have only had for about 3 months so i could do a side by side.appearance - i got the walnut and it was worth the premium over the others.  i looks good.  not like real wood, but very nice and blends in well.  size is great, it is much smaller and does not stick out like the first does.function - after getting set up, sitting next to gen 1 echo, i noticed the mic(s) are more sensitive in a good way.  sound was a draw as i listened to the same song on each, back to back and while there were subtle differences, it was not enough to say one was better than the other, just different....but hold up a minute!!  i checked firmware and it was the same but my testing was interrupted by a notice from alexa that an update needed to be completed.  i waited....1 minute maybe and it was done.  i started testing again and boom, the new echo wins hands down.  the most noticeable is in the voice/mids which is much richer.  i have a bose revolve+ and i will stop there and just say, the new echo is really good.  when getting flash briefings etc. the voices are richer and more clear, and gen 1 is not bad at all.  for music it is even better, especially since i have had a chance in the last 24 hours to listen to more and different music.so, the new gen 2 echo is a winner, and even moreso with the black friday weekend pricing, especially with the tp link deals, since i have tp link products, and needed another plug anyway.  even at the full $99 ($119 for certain finishes) it is well worth it.with it is smaller size, i may replace another echo dot with one of these new echo is."
25,14,"this is my third echo product; i already have a 1st generation echo, a 1st gen dot, and now this new 2nd gen echo. we have hue lights throughout the house, along with some additional smart home devices, so my goal is to make using those devices easier to use with voice access in key rooms. i also hoped to enjoy the ¡°improved sound¡± advertised in the name.so why did i give  it just three stars? first, we wanted to use the drop-in feature across the house as a room to room intercom. unfortunately, that did not work as i had hoped. amazon requires that you grant access to your contacts for drop-in to work, allowing them to upload the information to their servers. i do not understand why the need all my contacts on order for me to talk from one echo device to another registered on the same account in the same household on the same wifi. that is unreasonable.second, i wanted to utilize the multiple room music feature. my phone is my primary music playing device, so using bluetooth to stream is my norm. however, the multi-room feature only seems to work if you are using one of the music services. plus, we use apple music, which is not an option. while i am not surprised it is not there, it would be nice if it was. (why can not multi-billion dollar companies play nicely together?)third, i am not impressed with the sound. i hear no substantial difference from the first gen (i have the most updated firmware as of nov 26, 2017). it does not sound bad, but it is nothing impressive in even a medium sized room. if you are going to claim ¡°improved sound¡± in the product name, it should be at least a noticeable improvement.fourth, and this is a small quibble, we ordered the sandstone fabric (white) version, to blend in with our decor. why is the cord and plug black? details matter... a white cord with the white device. if you are going to advertise multiple colors to match decor, then make the entire device match.i am hoping that having alexa access in multiple rooms is going to be more useful. the ball is in amazon is court to make these devices really useful, as opposed to just a novelty."
26,14,"historyi own and am happy with the the 1st gen echo.  it serves my life nicely in our kitchen for measurement conversions, timers, weather reports, and the occasional family dance parties when eating snacks and deserts. i was compelled to add more echo devices to my 2017 christmas list after amazon announced drop-in calling and multi-room music features.  i previously used apple is airport expresses to create a multi-room music experience and the idea of using my voice to control my music in multiple rooms was a hard one to pass up.pros+ better sounds than echo gen 1 (as of latest update - post christmas 2017)+ smaller form factory, color, and style (i got the gray fabric) makes it a better looking device than the 1st gen, especially as a stand alone shelf unit (versus sitting next to your other black plastic electronics)+ it performs most of its advertised features pretty well+ multi-room music works great with amazon unlimited and/or spotifyneutral* sound as a whole is comparable to most mid-range price bluetooth speakers. you can not really compare it to a sony or bose, but then again you pay a price for that quality.  sound is pretty much what i expected (maybe even a bit better) for their 80-120 price point* sometimes the echo does not respond when i call for alexa, other times she responds without being prompted.  since this is new-ish technology i give it a pass here as it is features far out-way the occasional hiccup.cons (mostly with new added features, could be improved based on updates or amazon offerings)- 1st gen and echo plus offer the ability to change volume with a large dial built-in to the top of the speaker. this version only has plus or volume buttons (similar to echo dot).  the large dial is far superior to the buttons, in both speed and ease of use when changing volume- intercom or drop-on feature is not that great  when speaking between devices on the same network there is some delay (for today is standard anyway) and on nearly every call whole words or sentences do not get picked up, prompting you to miss some of the conversation. the quality is similar to my cheap ip camera is intercom feature that i use in my kid is room.- multi-room music and amazon is music upload feature (or lack thereof) do not allow you (any more anyway) to stream your personal music library natively through their echo ecosystem. (read more below why this feature changed my mind about owning multiple echo products)why multiple echos will not work for me...i do not rely on any one streaming music service as my only go-to home music choice, i enjoy a variety of artists that may or may not be on certain services. when i added multiple echos to my christmas list i was counting on taking advantage of echo is new multi-room music feature along with amazon is music upload service to play music from my personal library throughout my house.  amazon is music upload service allowed you to upload 250 free songs or thousands of songs for 25 a year.  unfortunately i did not do proper research and found out that amazon had just recently shut down this service (12/2017) which is the only way to play your music through their ecosystem.  while you can use skills such as ""plex"" or ""my media"" to play your library on one speaker, only amazon music and spotify currently support multi-room music. i am disappointed that amazon took this service away right after adding multi-room support. both apple and google offer upload features and if i would had realized this before the christmas season i would have a google home and google home mini under my tree instead. google is home devices offer most of the same features, cost the same, and googles allows you to upload up to 50,000 free songs from your personal collection to google play.conclusionthe echo 2nd gen works as advertised and most people will probably appreciate everything echo has to offer for the price, especially if you are an amazon unlimited or spotify heavy user. however, if you are looking to play your personal library on multiple speakers, this is no longer an option for you."
27,14,"finally broke down and bought an echo (have had firetv stick for a year) and am enjoying it quite a bit. i am reviewing not only the device (echo) but the interface (alexa). mainly useful for playing music, imho -- sound quality is truly great btw -- but drawback is the interface often does not recognize made-up words or words with alternative spellings, which are common in musical songs and albums. for example, while it lists the devin townsend project album z2 correctly as z-squared, it can not seem to find it when one asks it to play. another -- ""apocalypto"" is the title of an old motels album, and again alexa could list it, but seems unable to play it. (workaround - manually create playlists with alexa-recognizable names.)i have yet to get the interface to add anything to my music through verbal command, yet this is something it should be able to do. i find the ability to create playlists via verbal commands to be annoyingly slow, much easier to use the app. i have had similar difficulties accessing order details, get a lot of ""i am not sure what went wrong"" answers.regardless of these inconveniences, the echo and alexa do an incredible job given the short time the device/interface has existed. i look forward to its evolution."
28,14,"i am in love! this is the first item i purchased for setting up new home automation. i had read all sorts of reviews on the things i could do with alexa but had no clue as to the endless things possible. first, setup was a breeze, just make sure you have it on the same network as all other equipment or gadgets you plan to do. follow all instructions and if there is a problem, amazon has a great help sight. so, outside of playing music or telling a joke, i am very impressed as i am setting up a whole home automation. it paired great with the philips hue bulbs, echo dot and harmony hub. setting up the groups, devices and scenes in the echo took a little while and then setting up routines on my iphone, a bit longer. only your imagination can hold you back on the endless possibilities for this! so far, i have lights, tv, satellite, dvr, my receiver and even netflix set up with much more to come. a simple ""alexa, good morning"" command can get your tv and lights up along with the news of the day and weather report right at your voice. like i said, only yourimagination and a few tech skills are the limits of this."
29,14,"i bought the 3 pack to add to my 8 other alexa devices. very disappointed in the sound that was sold as ""improved""."
30,14,"update:the one thing that set this apart from tall gen! is the microphone really hears better and ignores background noise. it seems to be able to ignore the music or audiobooks its playing much better than gen1. gen1 would ignore me if i was further away while it played music unless i raised my voice. this gen2 even hears me when i am in the bathroom and say alexa louder. the music, audiobook voices are improved, warmer, as good as radio in the car or over earphones.i have had first echo for many months. i listen to music and audible audiobooks with it. this new gen2 version is different, a little better. the audio is a tad better. the microphone array is better after you do basic training first.the device is shorter. squatter, less able to tip over. if i miss anything, its the volume ring. it was so easier to reach over in the dark and adjust volume. yes, you can verbally tell it raise/lower, softer/louder volume. the ring was finer adjusting. also i wish the volume buttons (- or +) were raised or the symbols themselves were raised too."
31,14,"better sound this time around after the update. i had purchased a sonos one. it sounded pretty darn good but the alexa integration was wonky. took it back and for half the price gambled that amazon had fixed the sound issues with this new version of the echo.got it home and turned it on. sounded meh. but, i expected that as i knew it would have to update the firmware to get the audio fix.5 minutes later the echo informed me it was shutting down to update.nice. not stunning but very nice sound. considerably better than gen 1 echo. placing it 2 inches from the wall seemed to be the optimum distance to get the best bass response. the high end can be harsh on certain tunes but overall it is a very well balanced speaker which sounds way better than most bluetooth speakers in its price range.now if they can only figure out how to make a pair of them play in stereo, i would get another one tomorrow.great job amazon!"
32,14,"*update*amazon released a software update shortly after the release of the new echo that positively impacted the audio quality. it is still not great and the original absolutely sounds superior<u+2014>by a bunch of miles<u+2014>but the new one is at least listenable with the new update.i can not help but feel that this problem could be solved by giving users eq control now that we¡¯ve seen how much of an impact software makes<u+2014>but that is hopefully something coming in the future.i¡¯m pretty disappointed in the new echo. while being touted as having better audio than the original, it very clearly does not. even simple things like audio books sound bad compared to the original. if you¡¯re thinking of upgrading to get better audio alone, reconsider that.it is not all bad though. the new echo does seem to do a better job at recognizing voice commands while playing audio or an alarm is ringing. i¡¯m finding that i can generally speak at a normal volume and it still hears commands, which is something the original struggled with."
33,14,"i never write reviews and i consider myself a pretty heavy prime user. in my book, amazon usually knocks it out of the park with their products but i am really not sure they got it all together with this gen 2 echo. we love our gen 1 and decided on picking up another and went and preordered the gen 2. when it arrived it was good looking from an esthetic standpoint but i immediately noticed a different sound in comparison to the gen 1. i was compelled to run to the gen 1 and play a song and then tried the same song on the gen 2 and it just did not feel as crisp and sharp as the gen 1 does. i do not want to be too critical because it does sound good but not if your comparing it to the gen 1. i do not know- maybe it needs tweaking or maybe i should just return it. i¡¯m torn."
34,14,"let me preface this review by revealing a few facts about myself. i am male, aged 75 years old, and more tech savvy than most people my age, but if you can use a modern computer, and own one, you should have not problem using this device. it is so far, miraculous, and intriguing! i bought mine about a week ago, and waited till a couple days ago to jump in with ""both feet"" and set it up. even though i once did computer tech support for dell computers, it was a long time ago now, and a lot of tech has evolved since then, and i have the same fear of new things as most people my age, though admittedly higher skills. i also own an iphone 6s plus, of which i have mixed emotions. the iphone is made by apple, and  apple is idea of ""intuitive"" and mine are very different. microsoft is much better at designing ""intuitive"" into an operating system than apple. aniyway, you will need some type of connected wifi device to use this product. (read that cell phone with it is own wifi abilities, and bluetooth built in) you will need to download the ""alexa app. "" on that device to set up the alexa products.from that point on, simply plug in the echo device into a regular 110v. wall outlet, it comes with a plug in adapter. there are no batteries in this device, although some have them.  a note here"" yes, you can unplug it without  it losing its brains and requiring repeat set up. so though not specified anywhere i read it evidently has some on board nonvolatile memory built in that will allow this. ( i  spent several research sessions attempting to find this out, and finally had to bite the bullet and just try it. ) i moved it from one room location to another and within a few seconds it greeted me and said it was operational.  now i am only an old guy with pretty good hearing abilities yet, (not exactly an audiophile ) but with dolby digital sound, this is one nice sounding speaker system,fully as good as my 7 speaker altech lansing on my pc. it may even be better.if you have a normal ear, you will be amazed at the sound quality!now i am still learning about this product. every new thing i try i am pleasantly surprised. i plan to get at least a smart home door lock and thermostat to use with it in the future, and several light switches.  i am no great fan of the ""ring doorbell""  (due to frequently needed battery recharging) at this point, but i understand amazon has purchased that company and will soon have an interface app available to use with the ""ring system"" if you want to keep up with the march of technology, this device is probably your best doorway to that end, since amazon is committed to pursuing it. others may drop out along the way. (new) i made a hands free phone call to my son this moring as a test of the phone capabilities. sound on my end was like he was in the room. the alexa app and it is capabilities are evolving technologies. features will be added. (mine did an update download while playing music) do not be disappointed. it is attractively packed, and very capable, but the ""instructions"" are not detailed and are sketchy. lean about it online as i did before you purchase it. read as many reviews as your eyes and attention span will allow, and take the plunge! an education awaits you!"
35,14,"even after the update, the sound is still not quite on par with the first generation echo.  the bass response improved significantly after the update, but in a side by side comparison with the gen 1 the larger form factor still has a fuller sound.  still, more than acceptable for casual music listening and news; miles better than the dot in any event. for the money, i think it is a great deal.  if you are a more of an audiophile, you would probably be better of with the echo plus or sonos speaker (with their higher price tags).  kudos to amazon for getting the fix out so quickly."
36,14,"amazon echo is a great device (i was one of the first to have one and waiting for months for my first echo to ship as amazon vastly underestimated the demand for a device like this) and this echo (2nd generation) is a good upgrade from the original. there is no volume ring on the 2nd gen echo like there is on the original echo and the 1st gen echo dot but it is no big deal as there are volume buttons now and the cost of the volume ring was not worth it if you ask me (it was nice, but for most people not worth the money). most of the time you will want to adjust the volume by voice anyway (like ""alexa volume 5""). i actually prefer the cheaper volume buttons on the dot 2 to the volume ring now.the fact that you can just talk from across the room and it can hear you (most of the time) really sets this apart. if you think you already have an echo because you have siri, cortana, or google, then know that it is just not the same.things i do: set timers, set alarms, get weather info, ask basic questions, listen to music (like prime music, prime stations, songs i bought, etc), listen to radio, ask for jokes, turn things on and off, and i am sure i am forgetting some things. the echo really excels at playing music. i love it than i can ask for a song i want to hear and it will play it (most of the time anyway). at night i often listen to a local radio station and i just say ""alexa stop"" without having to get out of bed when i want to stop listening. if you have multiple echos then you can set up a music group and play the music through all of the echos in the music group at the same time so you can play music throughout the entire house or just downstairs or wherever you want. update: i have ran into some bugs/issues with some echos in a music group not playing music with the rest of the group so that is unfortunate.when i listen to prime station i can tell it ""thumbs up"" if i like the song or ""thumbs down"" if i do not... and when i listen to the station again it will not play the songs that i have thumbed down.using the built-in speaker, the sound quality is quite good for the size and price. a big plus is the addition of an aux output compared to the 1st gen echo. i somewhat wish i could airplay to a device from the echo when i am playing music and want the best sound quality, however bluetooth is pretty impressive when it uses the near-cd quality codecs.positives:* i like the form factor better than the 1st gen - it is shorter and a little wider but feels quite substantial and has a great non-skid rubber or rubber-like base.* the somewhat feature that amazon added (esp - echo spatial perception) so that the nearest echo responds is fantastic. unfortunately there does seem to be a minor downside: the echo is response can sometimes be slightly delayed while multiple echoes figure out which echo is closest and should respond.* it seems to hear better when playing music than the first gen. it was annoying when you would try to talk to it while it was playing but it could not hear you. the new echo hears better during music playback but it is still not ""star trek quality"" hearing; sometimes you may still need to raise your voice.* it is a good buy at the regular asking price and a better buy than the 1st gen echo.* it has a 3.5mm stereo audio jack. sound quality through this jack should be good enough for anyone except audiophiles.* works great and stays connected to my<u+00a0>asus rt-ac68u<u+00a0>router.* if you want to 'wikipedia' something then you can say 'alexa, wikipedia <subject>'. she will read a little from wikipedia. if you want her to read more after she stops then just say 'alexa, tell me more'. this can be useful sometimes.negatives (mostly minor but take note):* while trying out amazon music unlimited with the echo i immediately ran into the issue of the echo playing the explicit version of songs instead of the clean version. there should be an option to never play explicit songs and to play the clean version instead (some people have children). the workaround until amazon addresses this problem is to add the clean song to your music library and then say ""alexa play <song> from my library"".* the android amazon alexa app can be slow and frustrating sometimes. there seems to be opportunity for speed improvement here.* the android app has frustrating editing of text and does not allow you to tap the text in order to place the cursor for editing. i was trying to leave some feedback and needed to go back and edit but i cannot edit anything without deleting everything back to the point where i want to edit. kind of ridiculous and very frustrating. the ios app also suffers from this frustration (actually it seems you can get around it in ios by holding your finger down but why are they making editing text so difficult?).* if you have lights in multiple rooms and echos in multiple rooms then you might think that you could say ""turn on the lights"" and it would turn the lights on in that particular room based on which echo heard the command... but alas, it does not seem possible to do this. you have to name the lights differently, like ""study light"" and say ""turn on the study light"". it is too bad you can not just say ""turn on the lights"" in the study and it will turn on the study lights because the echo that is in the study heard the command.* does not hear well in a noisy environment, or when other people (including on tv) are talking at the same time.home automation:* i use several<u+00a0>belkin wemo<u+00a0>switches to control some lights and fans. they work pretty well although not always perfectly. i also recently added a philips hue system as well.* i can control my honeywell wifi thermostats using the ""honeywell total connect comfort"" skill. i have two downstairs for 2 zones. i have one<u+00a0>honeywell rth9580wf1005/w1<u+00a0>and one<u+00a0>honeywell rth6580wf.* i recently set it up to turn on and off certain activities with a<u+00a0>logitech smart hub. for example, i can say ""alexa, turn on tivo"" and it will turn on the tv and my receiver and set the tv and receiver inputs correctly. i can then use the remote which is synced... and turn it all off with ""alexa turn off tivo"". there were some annoyances getting it all setup but i think it is pretty ""cool"" even though you can only start and stop activities with alexa so you still need the remote to do other things (change channel, adjust volume, mute, pause, etc).* i think i have only really scratched the surface of what is possible with home automation. i have not tried ifttt (""if this then that"") recipes yet but i hear it is quite powerful and hope to try it out when i have more time to ""play"".wishes:* high-quality digital audio output that is better than bluetooth. if it had this then you could really get high quality audio output from it, but most people probably do not really care that much as analog out is ""good enough"".* smarter. after 2 years i wish the echo was smarter. yes, it has definitely improved over time but google can still answer more questions than alexa. it is going to be hard to beat google in answering general questions.* severe weather alerts. i suggested these alerts a long time ago and they still have not added it to my knowledge... perhaps due to legal reasons? if would be great if it would sound some sort of alarm or notification for severe weather.* built-in support for notifying others that you might need help. this would be good for the elderly. there is a ""ask my buddy"" skill however, but the verbiage is a little awkward (""alexa, ask my buddy to send help"") and it is free so if the developer decides to stop support then that might leave a lot of people without service at an inopportune time.compared to google home:* setup on google home was super-simple, easier than echo (the android app worked really well and setup seemed streamlined)* google home is smarter for general questions... significantly smarter. i asked google ""how long does it take to get to the honda dealer in lewisville"" and it told me about 26 minutes in current traffic conditions. awesome. the echo totally failed here.* no aux audio output like on echo dot* i prefer saying ""alexa"" to ""ok google"" or ""hey google""* i currently prefer echo for music and smart home control but i consider google home a serious threat to echo because it is more ""intelligent"" than echoother:* it does not come with a 3.5mm audio cable but i can understand why as many people would probably not use it and amazon wants to get the cost as low as possible so this is not a big deal.* about 10 or 15 minutes after setting it up, it said something like ""your echo received an important update and must restart"". so if you are having issues with it then you may want to give it awhile so it can update if needed.* for better understanding of what you say, go to the alexa app and settings->voice training.while not perfect, i really like the amazon echo. i think the technology and potential is still in its infancy but the echo is already really useful and excels at home automation, playing music, podcasts, and radio. i am giving it 4 stars due to google home being much smarter at answering general questions and due to the negatives i have mentioned above. the echo is a good device but i think you should also seriously consider google home, or maybe even both like i have."
37,11,"i was really excited to get my new echo. i have the original echo and have enjoyed it. the online reviews all mentioned better sound. but, the reality is the sound is not very good. my wife has a soundlink color ii and the sound is much better. i returned the new echo after only one day."
38,14,"i visited my daughter last weekend and she had purchased an echo a week before. i always thought these things were silly and unnecessary. as i work in it security i rolled my eyes at the idea of me installing a ""listening device"" in my house.well, i played with it a couple hours and ordered a dot. the next day i bought an echo too.i am a music lover and its music features alone are what sold me. connected to a free pandora and prime account,  i have lots of music at my fingertips. i am branching into roots music and being new to it i constantly hear new songs. it is a good thing i do not get charged every time i say, ""alexa, who is this?"" and ""alexa, i like this"" which upvotes it in pandora so it learns my tastes. and therein lies its beauty. i can be cooking, reading, cleaning, or anything you can imagine and interact with music services like i had a servant catering to my every desire. on a whim with just a few words. without having to pick up a damn phone or fiddle with knobs.it is not a high end, high power audio system. but i find the quality and volume more than adequate around the house. if i want it louder i can easily plug it in to my home audio system or plug/pair it with my bluetooth speaker...which was twice the price and was not anything but a speaker.as for the security concerns, i just go in the bathroom and turn on the exhaust fan and shower when i want to talk privately. just kidding!! several things made me believe the features were worth the small risk (and everything carries some risk):1. i live alone so it does not have much to hear. but even if i did not i do not think i would be too concerned.2. it is not supposed to send anything to amazon until activated by its attention word (alexa by default). if it ever got out that it was sending sound before that, it might mark the end of the market for these devices. well, maybe not, we are putting up with similar crap from phone os and apps, isp snooping, video surveillance everywhere, web site trackers, etc.3. if it collected credit card numbers or medical information that might put all of amazon or google is home device infrastructure in scope for pci or hipaa compliance. something they would probably prefer to avoid. ;) equifax and probably a dozen other companies already gave away my national password, er, ssn. but i digress.like i said, its capabilities as a versatile, easy, hands free interface to music services is why i bought it (and its low price and wanting to have music more distributed around the house).all its other features are frosting on the cake. i am not particularly interested in home automation but i will probably tinker with it at some point. it might be useful to make and receive hands free phone calls if it can do that. information lookup? bleh. it is not often i want a sound bite answer to anything. voice purchases? probably not. i am likely to order repeat stuff while i am online shopping for other stuff or looking at a menu. and tying voice actuation to a credit card attached account seems like an accident waiting to happen. programming capabilities and routines? i will have to see how powerful the api is. in the back of my mind i am thinking of how it might be useful to tie it to my karafun account and maybe firetv if my ps3 ever dies. or maybe tie it to local event web sites so i can say, ""alexa, what is happening in town tonight?"". maybe it can already do something like that. i do not know. i am a newbie.btw, i bought a second echo. i do not splurge often but having a music genie in another room for $79 was too hard to pass up.why did i buy amazon over google? price. features.i think google will eventually be better at information lookups because, well, they are google. but that feature is low priority for me."
39,14,"this is a very impressive bit of technology, but i only have it because i got it for christmas. honestly, i have trouble thinking up anything i actually want alexa to do. she is a radio, but i have a radio. she is not a tv, and i usually watch news or sports on tv if i have time to kill. i used her once as a timer for a cake, but i have a timer, and my phone will time things as well. i asked her for the weather once, but i can get more info from the weather app on my phone. to be fair, i have similarly underappreciated siri on my phone, and i have never used cortana on my computer, despite the fact that she is constantly bugging me to do so. i may come to love alexa over time, but so far she just sits silently on my counter making me feel guilty for ignoring her."
40,14,"after struggling and a little help from customer service i was able to get this thing connected. seems to be working okay now, still a bit buggy with the voice commands. i am hoping it gets better as time goes on. seems to be nice enough, not really sure if i actually needed this or not. i will say that amazon has awesome customer service, within a few minutes of posting a poor review i had gotten a phone call and emails on how to resolve the issues. this is why i love amazon and why they crush the competition. the jury is still out on whether i needed this thing on the even like it, but once again amazon came through with their service.i was never informed that i have to pay an extra $78 a month for the amazon unlimited streaming to use this device properly even though i am a prime member. so now i have something i did not need any way that is going to cost me extra money. i could care less about the extra money it is just the point of the matter and i am very very unhappy with amazon now. my recommendation is not to buy"
41,14,"the echo 2nd generation is a brilliant piece of technology and for your listening pleasure, and i mean serious listening pleasure, having bought two of the echo 2nd generation, i can have both speakers playing, as an example, the music of toni braxton, and living in a small 1 bedroom apartment, the sound is superior. i also have an echo dot, which i patched into my receiver and with amazon music, the tracks are endless. i was able to sell my entire cd collection which was primarily, a collection of jazz, and now, most of the music i request from amazon music is available and sounds so damn great. with amazon fire tv, there is little that i need or want. youtube has scores of the buddy rich big band on video and for the most part, the audio is absolutely terrific. i know this reads like an ad for amazon but i am not related to anyone that remotely works there nor do i have any special interest in the company but i must tell you, that with the advent of echo 2nd gen, echo dot, a new yamaha receiver (tsr 5830) and amazon fire tv, i am in another galaxy of pleasure, of audio nirvana. oh yes, i forgot, 2 new klipsch sound speakers, has made my life a great place to be in. music is the heartbeat of my existence and all of the above devices and music formats have made my life a new and exciting experience."
42,14,"bought three more of these 2nd generation echos for other areas of my home and i like them very much.new software features are being added regularly to this hardware-- some examples of what i am using echo for are:1) controlling heating and cooling throughout my home with my voice using ecobee themostats2) controlling lights and other electrical devices with my voice using wink3) controlling a home entertainment system (but currently only allows one per home so you are out of luck for now if you want to control two tvs!)4) using echo as a in home intercom system5) use echo to make (not receive) outside calls using the echo as a speakerphone.  you must tell it to dial a specific number (alexa, dial 603 572 1455) as it does not access your entire list of contacts at this time so you cannot generally dial by name.much still needs to be worked out with alexa/echo and other voice control systems.  the organization of the 'skills' is haphazard and the skills (app equivalents) themselves are mostly pretty lame or uneven.  you cannot give more than one command at a time (for example, 'alexa, turn off the kitchen and bathroom light') and you can not intuitively get answers to many questions (for example, what channel is the basketball game on) without referencing other skills and or adhering to a very specific lexicon.  i assume and hope that this will all improve with time as amazon and others figure out how folks are really using these devices. frustratingly, amazon refuses to use google for its searches and an alexa search is always on bing-- not the best.nevertheless, i find with use that i like having alexa around and this new (snd)generation is both less expensive and just as good as the original echo released 3 years ago, it seems as though alexa will wind up being built into many devices in your home and will become ubiquitous eventually rather than being a cylinder in just a few rooms.  at that time, we ill continue to be concerned with how much of what we do is shared with the internet and available to others."
43,14,"still learning the echo and all it can do. i hope this review helps manage your expectations. the echo is excellent at playing music, games, and books, which is the main thing i wanted it for. many other reviewers laud its ability to manage smart home devices, but i have not had a chance to try that yet, other than my fire stick. i find the sound to be very good for a speaker its size with enough bass.its ability to search the internet for answers to questions is very limited, which is disappointing. maybe there is at least a wikipedia skill for that, i am still looking. there are a lot of ""skills"" (basically plugins) that extend the functionality which i have only begun to explore. the downside is there are so many, it is hard to weed out the good from the bad, let alone remember the commands to open them. alexa sometimes suggests a skill, and i think that is a step in the right direction in the development of the ai.if you were looking for a siri or google assistant that could answer all sorts of questions and search the internet for you, the echo has a way to go. i really hope amazon puts some effort into improving search.if you were looking for a bluetooth speaker that can interact with you and play stuff on demand, it is worth the extra cash."
44,14,"i just received and yesterday set up my new echo 2nd generation (""echo 2"").  until a co-worker sung its (the echo 1 is) praises, i thought this an unnecessary product.  but hearing her and seeing it in action compelled me to purchase one immediately (i actually bought the discounted 3-pack to give the others as gifts).  i could not be more pleased with my echo 2.  first off, setup took merely a few minutes with the app walking me through everything.  secondly, alexa can hear me anywhere in my (modestly-sized) house.  i tested her behind closed doors and understandably she cannot hear me under those conditions.  she is otherwise placed in the middle of my home and i barely raise my voice when i am talking to her from the far reaches of my house.  beautiful!  i have come to learn what questions she can reasonably answer, and what abstract questions she could not be expected to answer.  if you are realistic, you will get almost all of your queries answered by her.  my co-worker had a new dot and showed me that it could make calls!  i told her to call her desk phone and she said, ""alexa, call [her 10-digit number],"" and it rang immediately!  i then realized this was much more than a gimmick and knew it could be used in emergency situations when your cell phone may not be available to you, or if you have fallen or been hurt.  that is what convinced me to get mine (and a few others).i have only had her for a day or so, but am forever impressed with the answers she gives, jokes she will tell, and the fact that i can call people in my contacts list (or a separate phone number i dictate), or simply set a timer, without doing anything more than flapping my lips!  i also have her connected to my pandora music account.  even though i regularly listen to rock music on it through my desktop and high-end audio setup, i find often intone, ¡°alexa, play classical radio,¡± and am treated to soothing old old-school music throughout my home.  while the sound i get out her obviously does not compare to that of my 100w/channel stereo system, it is extremely impressive just the same.  volume levels are 1-10 and anything over 7 is actually too loud and unnecessary.  in any event, the sound is and can go way beyond what you would consider reasonable background music; and it is crystal clear and sonically beautiful.  i simply did not expect it from this seemingly small and simple device.  i have since been viewing youtube videos on all she can do and am seriously contemplating automating the lights in my home with a hue or wemo setup.  it appears i can do this for an initial cash outlay of maybe $100-$150.the echo 2 is much more than a general ""assistant"" and i can not believe i have waited this long to buy one.  i am 100% unequivocally pleased and know that i have only scratched the surface of what she can do.  also, i do believe i am going to purchase one or two of the ""lesser"" dots, just to keep one next to my recliner in my living room (on one side of my house), and my nightstand (on the other side of my house).  yes, i have said my single echo 2 can hear everything, but i dunno, at two for a c-note, i kind of like the idea of having information i can request and receive at a whisper right next to me too (and i might even put one in my car, tethering it to my unlimited data smartphone).  yes, i guess this all makes me lazy with all the service and convenience, but you know what, i am going to have to say that i am worth it.  at $100 for a single echo 2 (i understand the echo 1 first went for $200, then $179), for this wondrous device that will literally change your life -- this is a complete no brainer.  i guarantee you will love it too!"
45,14,"i am immersed in to the amazon/ alexa ecosystem. i have the first gen echo, the show, multiple dots, the spot, kickstarter devices, tablets, fire tv, fire stick, and now the 2nd gen echo.amazon got it right with the 2nd gen. considering i paid over $200 when the 1st gen came out the price to own the 2nd gen is much more reasonable and a no brainer. the farfield voice recognition is superior over the 1st gen no more screaming to wake alexa. the compact design makes the device visually less intrusive, more stable, and opens up a bit more flexibility as to it is placement.now the big question is how is the audio? of all my echo devices as listed it is got the most bass, audio sounds richer. it does not get quite as loud as the first gen and show. i tested this by playing the same song on the everywhere setting. meaning the same song played on all my devices at the same time. i went from room to room and noticed that the best sounding echo device was the second gen. in all fairness i did not take in to account the acoustics of the room and sizes with my test.i do miss the spin dial on top for volume control, but other than that i am extremely satisfied with the second gen is performance."
46,14,"i decided to wait a few days before posting this review, because initial impressions consisted of one word: eww.i know this speaker is not that of bose, sonos, or any known high-end brand, but the audio quality was simply terrible. alexa sounded pretty drunk when it responds to whatever i asked it to do, which was actually more comical than irritating.i guess after a night or two (and several one star reviews later), there was an update to the echo firmware and it somehow improved the audio quality making music sound halfway decent, and alexa sounds like she is sober enough to recite my reminders for the day (as if i was that important).honestly, the speaker sounds decent, it is neither the bottom of the barrel nor the top of the crop. (ugh, corny, i know.) alexa works as expected. that is pretty much it. get it if you want it, pass if you do not, simple as that."
47,14,"my sister has one, my mom has one, and now i have one! i love alexa! i guess you can say we were the hold outs in our families but when black friday came around i purchased the echo for our great room and the dot for our bedroom.i am someone who listens to audiobooks and podcasts all day so i love that i can link my phone into this and use it as a speaker as well as all of the other great things alexa does! my husband was a little worried that someone was ""listening"" to us but i like that i can go into the alexa app and re-assure him that nothing we speak about was in her log. this was definitely a nice reminder that amazon was not using this to be big brother. lolduring the christmas season alexa played great holiday music while i made cookies, she learned quickly that i love george strait and willie nelson, and now if i just say ""play some music"" she plays my favorites. i am impressed! we even plated battleship with her! my nephews were cracking up on christmas when she was rapping about the reindeer lmaowe are currently shopping for thermostats and lights to incorporate with our new fav little tech toy!"
48,14,"much anticipated echo arrived.  i opened package, downloaded alexa app for my android fone, plugged echo in and orange ring appeared.  app opened and i located the echo on my wifi list.  alexa said ""connected,"" but the orange ring continued to spin, indicating she is lying.  finally she said, ""i am having trouble connecting to the internet.""  at last, the truth!  ""for help, try the alexa app.""  and of course, looking for help there was about as fruitful as looking for help from windows wifi setup when something goes wrong.  my computer wifi setup screen said ""connected, no internet.""  i checked online and could find no help there.i do not have time for crap like this. i have set up all kinds of wifi stuff over the years.  it should not be this hard to do.  and there should be help available in the form of, ""if it says this, then do that.""  simple.  yet tech gadget manufacturers, in their arrogance, presume their stuff works first time, every time and do not bother to provide any useful troubleshooting assistance.so i am sending it back.  no time for this crap."
49,14,"since leaving my original review, amazon customer service reached out to me via phone and email.  they have since released an update and the product in fact sounds better.  i have improved my original review from 2 to 4 stars.  this product is great bang for the buck.  i am now say i am truly pleased.1st reviewafter all the excitement leading up to receiving this echo, we were highly disappointed. the original echo though not as loud, sounds so much better than this one.  i am constantly convincing my colleagues and friends to steer clear of the google home, and choose the amazon line up of products.  slightly embarrassed with this product.  truly hoping there is some sort of update that will make it sound better.  if not i will have to return it."
50,14,"i preordered and was excited to receive the new echo.  i have a dot that i was using through some old computer speakers, and controlling my sonos play one since they recently released the integration.  unfortunately, the new echo sounds similar to the dot, there is only a little improvement in the sound quality.  with the dot plugged into my old computer speakers it sounds much better than the echo.  and the sonos is insanely better than the echo.  but in addition to the sound quality, the microphones seem less powerful too.  where the dot can hear me from across the room, i have to speak loudly for the echo to hear me.  so now that they are going to offer the echo for $80 instead of the $100 i paid, i am feeling some buyers remorse.  i am thinking of returning it and getting a sonos one.edit: yes, i have the latest firmware upgrade.  sound quality is still not good.  i am not comparing to previous echo, just to dot and other small powered speakers.edit 2: further updates have helped and this speaker is now living in my kitchen where it sounds good enough. if you are looking for background music in a single room, this will work.  add the volume gets louder, the sound quality gets worse."
51,14,"i must say i was pleasantly surprised by the difference in sound and sensitivity of this second gen echo vs the original, especially since reading initial reviews that it was not much better. perhaps the updates made the difference since it appears noticeably better than the original in both sensitivity to voice control and really excellent pristine sound with perfect bass. i admit i am not an audiophile, but the difference is clear to me and the sound is very pleasing. i usually use the riva turbo x connected to my echo dot, but i really like this one unit better. my only gripe is that the power supply is not a usb standard but rather a large ac adapter. it would make things much better for travel if it used usb. if the issue is not enough power, then it could use the new standard usb c with power delivery that is being used with the newest laptops and chromebooks. because of the quality of the device and the significant improvement in sensitivity and sound, i do not see a reason to remove a star for something i would like to see to make it more travel friendly"
52,14,"thanks to the reviewers that prompted amazon to improve echo ii is sound quality issues by automatically installing software updates. nice timely/prompt work on the updates amazon, good job! just fired up my new echo ii (a gift- had not ever had an echo prior), and i experienced the same issue with very lackluster audio. about 15 minutes after setting up & connecting echo ii to wifi (follow the prompts on alexa app), alexa informs me that she has received an update, and will have to restart in order to install it. 3 min later, she restarts... low and behold- very nice audio! software update is version 592452720, which you can check for in the alexa app 'settings > devices > click on your echo device > scroll down to device software version. echo ii looks to be a fine addition to our household. we have prime, so tons of music available- so far have asked alexa to play: soft jazz; rhapsody in blue (she brought up the leonard bernstein/new york philharmonic version); cake; zz top; vince guaraldi. all sounded great. other tasks tried so far- 'set an alarm; tell me a knock-knock joke; what is the weather; where is the closest home depot; tell me the news ('flash briefing'). all were performed flawlessly. looking forward to discovering other echo ii capabilities. highly recommended, and at the black friday weekend prices, a bonafide no-brainer!"
53,14,"this product promised an increased quality of the previous 1st-gen device. if you are expecting that claim to hold up, you will be sorely disappointed. the sound quality does not even meet that of the 1st gen. the lows are higher, and the highs are tinny. we had this packed up and returned the next day.we un-boxed and setup, removing our 1st gen in the process. setup was easy as usual, but when she started talking we knew the sound was worse. we plugged in the 1st gen and did a side-by-side comparison. we were disappointed in almost every aspect. heck, even the light is not as bright.the only improvement is the voice pickup. there is now an array of mics on the echo which let it hear and understand you better. also, it seems to filter out background noise better.lastly, while the new styles look great (we got the pine case), the cord-port is a giant tumor on the case. the previous 1st gen ran the cord under the base to plug in. this 2nd gen has the inset on the ""back"", so the look is not nearly as clean.i think we will wait for the new 2nd gen ""plus"" versions to go on sale"
54,14,"pros:  good sound quality, especially for somewhere like a bedroom.  and absolutely gorgeous design. i love how this looks on my nightstand, not to big and just looks good quality. it blends in well, but stands out just enough.  having alexa at my bedside is also wonderful for those thoughts that i get and need reminders for, but i¡¯m to tired to roll over and type something on my phone.cons: i have 2 major gripes with this.1. no integration with the amazon music app. you can really only play music through alexa voice commands, or limited browsing in the alexa app. i can not understand why i can not browse in the amazon music app and tell it to play on my echo... sure i could use bluetooth, but then why have the echo. maybe i¡¯m just spoiled by my sonos system, but this seems like a no-brainer.2. you cannot include a non-amazon speaker in a multi room setup. i have my sonos speaker added as a speaker and can control it with alexa, but i can include it for multi room audio purposes... lame.conclusion:  i really like it, and i want to keep it, but i do not think i can. i will be expanding my sonos system and i want to be able to play multiroom audio and this just will not fit into that dream, so i guess i will just have to fork over the extra for a sonos one."
55,14,"maybe it is just bad luck; in fact i am sure it is, but the first unit i received was defective. we have a term for devices doing what this one did, in the electronics industry: we say the unit ""smoked"". yes, it fizzled and smelled bad.then i was not able to connect up the replacement unit amazon sent me. i spent an hour and a half struggling with the network setup with their help desk. and i am a network pro!then the network person gave up and passed me to level two support. the phone connection was bad and i suggested the level two person hang up and called me back. he never called back.this is a new version of the echo, and i think it has software problems.i hope (and expect) that all these problems will be ironed out soon. but really....{edit:} we got my echo and my echo dot working ok. customer support was very nice about it, and helpful. this was too complex, though, and took way too long. and i am a compuuter engineer with 45 years' experience."
56,14,"very poor sound quality, a major disappointment in amazon.  secondly, the wi-fi adapter is nowhere as good as the version 1 product.  i can place our version 1 echo within feet of this new one and the new one cannot connect to wi-fi, whereas the version 1 echo works finecome on amazon, why build junk just for a lower price point, this is not what your customers wantreturned after one week of frustration"
57,14,"i have had my echo nearly two weeks now and i have to say it is been like night and day. when i first got my echo the sound was terrible. now the sound is so good i am wondering how amazon stuffed such a big sound in such a small package. i honestly dropped my jaw today when a fairly bass intensive song came on and my echo tackled it like a much larger sound system. this is a very worthy successor to the first gen echo.if you were on the fence about whether or not to get this device: go for it. you will not regret it.(old review)i bought this as an upgrade to the echo dot which i had for nearly a year, but did not like the sound it produced. the sound this new echo produces is much better than the dot, but nowhere near the sound of the gen 1 (which i have heard via display units many times). i get the distinct impression that a large reason the sound is not that good is due to the eq settings for the speaker. if amazon can give us control over the eq in the alexa app, i think customers could fix a lot of the issues themselves.this echo also has a few mild glitches at times. the light-ring stutters a bit at times, the unit may be slow to respond to commands, and sometimes a weird pop sound comes from the speaker before/after alexa talks, usually when asking alexa to handle an app like spotify.of course the unit is brand new so there are bound to be patches. i am not sending mine back unless amazon says this first run is defective. it has potential, but it needs improvements.update:i think my echo just received an update because the light bar was spinning (though i did not hear alexa say anything) and now it sounds like my echo has some more bass.when i put my hand on the desk next to the echo while playing music i can feel some vibration. there was nothing before the update. music is also noticeably more well rounded. could use a smidge more tweaking, but it is better.amazon is listening and it is working on our issues. bumping up to 4 stars for improved sound."
58,14,"i was so freaking excited for this product and ordered three. it was an epic letdown: the sound quality was horrible, when i had all of them grouped together the sound frequently cut in and out. i am very sad. returned them all and going back to the original echo."
59,14,"can not always see the clock but she is there to tell me time, temp, whatever. she does act up - she plays music i did not request and it is usually bad music. she occasionally says :""sorry, i do not know that."" i wonder - do not know what? i did not ask you anything. she can be quite cheeky. her pal, dot does not start chatting on her own - i think alexa is getting a big head. she told me she is often told her voice is her best feature. i did tell her she had a nice voice but she could have just said thank you.  i do not talk to these two very often so perhaps they wish someone else had purchased them. sorry girls - i may get another dot because alexa echo seems to be hard of hearing - i have to shout to be heard. yet she  eavesdrops when my granddaughter visits - she can be in another room and alexa makes comments - tries to sell her stuff! i will tame her!"
60,14,"i bought this because i thought that the audio would be better than my echo dot. it is for music, but not for speech.i can not decide if the cloth-like exterior is muffling the audio or if it is just the mix levels that i can not adjust, but it is difficult to hear and it also does not seem to ""hear"" as well.  yes, i have tried different placements and even compared it sitting right next to the dot.i really regret this purchase.save your money and buy a dot.eta - extra points though because amazon reached out to me."
61,14,"i wish there would have been reviews before amazon released this product,  i would not have bought this thing.  the first echo had such a rich smooth sound,  i figured this new one with imroved sound was going to be awesome.  i am saddened to say this new echo is nothing close to the first one.  this is about the second time i ever felt this strong about a product to ever write a review on it.  the sound is tinny and flat. if you turn the volume up even a little it gets harder to understand the song.  my husband hates it when i order from amazon and this time he was right.  do not order this thing,  they did not improve the sound,  they made it worse.  my husband is right this time you can not trust what you order from the internet.  it is that bad.  thanks amazon. i trusted you and your products and you let me down big time"
62,14,"i was about to pack this up to send back, but am fortunate to have checked the reviews first. the recent update made a dramatic improvement in the sound quality. cheers to amazon for acting quickly on this. i do not usually post reviews, but essentially wanted to offset some of these negative reviews that may no longer be relevant.so it passed my jeff buckley test and may get 5 stars with a little more use and if it passes my wife is tori amos test. the form factor and at least equal sound quality to the 1st gen make this a good buy if you liked the original.updated 12/14/2017: changing to 5 stars after prolonged use. actually measures up well against the beoplay a1, just has a more muffled sound. would not even really notice it much unless comparing them back to back."
63,14,"worst possible firmware design. first device i have ever seen that is not able to reconnect to wi-fi after hot-plugging the power. more, i connected first time to a 5ghz wi-fi, then i moved into another outlet: of course it required to go through setup process again. i was not able to connect again to 5ghz, but it connected to 2.4ghz. whenever it is moved to another outlet, it needs to redo the setup and the setup process is not a clear and simple process.the only good thing is i got this for free, if i had to pay for it i would regret every single penny."
64,14,"for our very tech savvy home, we have repeatedly put off jumping on the home voice assistant bandwagon.  i really liked the look of the charcoal finish on the echo 2nd generation and we now it sits on my desk.  i was upset at first because we have thousands of songs in our music library that we cannot connect to. this was a huge bummer and a big downside on my part.  however - i have found that i am now listening to a very wide of music that i did not before.  we go from ocean sounds, to metallica, to grunge, to classical on a whim and there have only been a few songs that i was told i needed to upgrade (pay) for.  this is something we may explore down the road.  i have made lists, checked the weather, we have news briefings set up, and yesterday we set up our first wifi enabled smart bulb which i now control with the echo/alexa.  we have a smartplug we are setting up today to test out and overall we are very happy.  the games are fun and while sometimes i feel like i am cheating when i ask ""alexa"" to look something up, i admit its a huge time saver.  we have an echo dot arriving next week for downstairs and will probably get a few more if the connections are everything we have read."
65,14,"so i can not give a full 5 stars. after the update it sounds better but not better then the generation one. but the biggest improvement is the mic... at a full level 10 plugged into a surround sound at level 60 it can hear ""alexa"" at a normal voice!  it is really unbelievable how much better it is on hearing me.*old reviewside by side with the original echo and the original sounds much better. they definitely did not improve the speaker.  if you can not get the generation 1 this would be alright. the mic is definitely ""improved"" she can now hear me with the volume maxed out.  the audio jack is a nice improvement also.  i guess i just thought generation 2 should be better all the way around especially when words like ""better"" and ""improved"" are used about the sound.  amazon is taking note though and called me out of the blue to get my take and the different tests i did to determine my judgement so maybe there is hope??"
66,14,"initially i was a bit hesitant in spending this much money on a smart speaker device, but when i saw it at someone is house and just how responsive and intelligent its answers were - i could not resist buying it. i have had it for a few days now, and i have to say its unbelievably good! at the very least, you get a great speaker - the audio (both treble and bass) is phenomenally good - although i have to give a disclaimer - it does really well in a small/medium sized room, but i am not sure of how good the acoustics would be for large rooms or open spaces.alexa: aside from being a fantastic speaker to play your music, there is alexa (now it starts to get exciting!). as a lot of other reviews have mentioned, it can do many things. my personal favorite is the alarm functionality in the morning and that i can just tell alexa to snooze for 5 minutes, or set it up to play a specific genre of music for the alarm. also, the news summary is a great way to start the day, which can be easily had by just asking alexa - whats the news? it can do a lot of standard functions that the smart assistants on phones do - such as call / text/ set a reminder, etc. the game feature (you can play games like jeopardy, song quizz, etc) is fun, and the microphone is really good - such that it can even hear me whisper ""alexa"" when i am near the device, and even when the tv is loud, you do not have to scream to call alexa.other functionalities: pairing with other alexa enabled devices such as light bulbs, switches, and other smart home devices. i have not tried it, but really curious and would probably be getting some of them in the near future.bonus feature (this is really amazing!) : if you are already using the fire stick tv (or are planning to buy one) alexa works seamlessly across the devices, so you can control your tv with the echo using voice. its a game changer. you can just ask alexa to open certain movies or open certain apps, and its that easy. watching prime videos is such a breeze, such that you can start a movie, pause, fast forward, or rewind by just asking alexa on the echo."
67,14,"got this at bb black friday deal.  there is a definite improvement in sound quality over the dot (have 2 of those).  we have this place in our main living area and have since relegated the dots to a kids bathroom and bedroom.if you do not really care about sound, get the dots, but if you like a little richer sound and better bass, get this for not much more. this is not going to beat a surround sound stereo system, but is definitely better than a dot and will appease most users.works well w/ prime music (have not used unlimited subscription, just what comes w/ prime) although it seems you can only have 5 devices connected, so if you have a few kids w/ phones, a firetv, another dot, a tablet etc, you can use up your allotment quickly for music streaming.i have used the calling and drop in features and although they are handy i do have privacy concerns as someboday can just start listening to what is on the other end w/ a drop in.  so i have setup only this device in the main living area to accept drop ins, but the bathroom/bedroom must be called to and i also set them up to only work on my own network.  the way updates work and amazons lack of caring about parental controls on other devices (like allowing any fire device to make a download of any free app despite parental restrictions) i feel this feature could be hacked or an update reset my settings to defaults that are less secure and you figure it out after the fact.i also enjoy the ability to ask alex to play a song ""everywhere"" so it can be playing in multiple rooms and i can her it if moving around the house.we do use the alexa app for setting up shopping orders, nice feature but wish could delete items off a list easier.calendar can now add to outlook.com or gcal so that is nice as welli have not tried a google device but so far am happy w/ this purchase."
68,14,"i was a bit cautious about buying this- but it went on sale and i figured, even if i hate it i can return it...  well, i love it!  i am not a super-tech-savvy guy, but i had it set up and playing music within 20 minutes of it being delivered to my home.  i used my ipad to ""install"" it (after getting the free alexa app), and that was it.  no problems.  sound is fantastic, and even though i bought it mainly for the music, i can see me using it to ask about the weather, how far it is to the nearest domino is pizza, and how late does my local grocery stay open.  if you like to listen to music and ask general questions, this is fantastic.  if you are really interested, you can do all kinds of other stuff with it.  i think i will keep it simple.  highly recommended!"
69,14,"title is misleading, because i bought the echo for $79 during the holiday sale!!! i am mainly a headphone guy, i have several pairs that get pretty pricey, as well as amplifiers. let me list some pros and cons of the echo.pros:+ compact (small footprint)+/- 360¡Æ sound (plays well in a variety of room locations, heard well from everywhere)+ alexa+ stylish designs+ feels well made, not like cheap plastic+ charger and cable feel qualitycons:+/- 360¡Æ sound- (possible) reliant on the quality of your wifi networklet me explain the +/- of 360¡Æ sound. firstly it is excellent because it is relatively impervious to location in a room. you can place it in a corner or in the center of a room and you have a consistent listening experience. the speakers are expertly tuned to provide a great listening experience for 99% of people without them having to be an audio enthusiast. but this is also it is source of contention. people compare it to directional bluetooth speakers, but this comparison cannot be made. directional speakers have a much easier time of producing sound because they only broadcast in, you guessed it, a single direction. but directional speakers also have their quirks, such as only sounding good when they are pointed directly at you, let is have any negative reviewer turn their comparator bluetooth speaker around and compare them that way!all in all, echo provides what i would determine as a 6/10 listening experience. 10 being $4k iems, 1 being children is toys. the $1000 stereo in the background is 8/10. most bluetooth speakers i have heard are 3-5/10."
70,14,"i ordered three of these at launch and was extremely disappointed by the sound when i first got them.after reading some reviews, i decided to update for the new update amazon pushed out and can say that the quality is definitely better than the original amazon echo. the bass is actually there lol. i highly recommend picking these up!"
71,14,"i love the echo 2nd generation till i found out you needed a android 5.0 and the i phone i can not remember system.  so having a cell phone was not not mentioned in the advertizing to allow the calling and texting feature to work.  my current cell phone only works with wifi which works great to download the amazon alexa app.  i have onstar in my pick up so no need for a cell phone.  so  you need a working cell number with the right working system for the calling and texting features to work.  i was offered small refund for my troubles but did return one of the 2nd generations because that person does not have a cell phone and will not buy one to have the calling and texting feature to work.  you can use a friends cell phone and number example spouce, friend, family member, it will not take from their minutes or text i am told by amazon. i also found out this week my parents echo the one where you have to push the button to make it wake up.  does not play the music my parents like from the 50 is.  mine does.  i would think amazon would want all the systems to work the same?  my parents no longer use their push button amazon echo.  i will get them a member ship so they can enjoy it more.  i also saw a you tube video this week and the man stated how their are so many different amazon echos.  i agree with him i think amazon needs to slow down on the number of echos they make and make them better with what they do!!  having to have a membership, certain echo, cell phone plans.  consumer cellular has a phone plan for $10.00 a month since echo does not require a texting feature from your cell phone company.  $15.00 plan for texting.  but the phone that would have the android 5.0 is between $80.00 to 100.00 still.  i phone may be different?  i only asked about android phones.i am happy with amazon service over all but i hope they keep the upgrades working to make echo smarter, and doing more.  i like to see echo work with more banks, in home items, security, onstar, sony play station ect."
72,14,"i loved alexa for about a week.  it was amazing.  once i made the mistake of connecting my contact list it has become problematic.  first amazon let is you know everyone else in your contact list that has alexa, and everyone that has your number know that you have alexa.there is no way to manage contacts.  it requires access to your mobile phone contacts.  it does not handle the complexity of duplicate names or multiple numbers well.  alexa need to do q&a to figure out which joe you want to call and which phone number to use.  i¡¯d be happy to pair it down just to the numbers i would use, but you can not.  alexa will not let you see, edit or delete the contacts once they have them.  i can no longer place a call and i fear accidentally calling acquaintances and work colleagues because alexa mistakes a comment that you made."
73,14,"<u+00a0>thanks for watching and reading my review of the amazon echo (2nd generation).  in fact, it is actually a review of just a few of the many possibilities of home automation.  i got started with home automation back in october, 2017 when i purchased a nest smart thermostat.  i followed up by purchasing an amazon echo and harmony hub for my home theater/av equipment.  from there i started purchasing some of the ""smart outlets"" to use with my regular lights, and for the holiday season, my christmas lights.as shown in the video, i am now able to control all my christmas lighting with one command, as well as control the temperature in the house and what i want to watch or listen to on the tv or stereo.  i know i have only scratched the surface of all the capabilities that are afforded by the echo.  once you purchase an echo i encourage you to keep an eye on the amazon ""skills"" because that is where you will find even more useful capabilities.  it takes a bit of tweaking on what you ""name"" your ""activities"" or ""devices"" but once you get that setup, alexa does a very good job of completing your request on the first try.as noted in the video, i have the following setup:amazon echo (2nd generation) and echo dot (2nd generation)nest thermostat (3rd generation)logitech harmony hub (controls tv, apple tv, receiver, etc)tp-link bluetooth receiver (connected to my yamaha receiver audio input)othway smart outletdekinmax smart outleti hope you found the video and review helpful."
74,14,"excellent next generation product! we have a few dots spread around the house primarily for alexa voice-quality content interaction and smart home control. but with our purchase of these new models, we now have a 2g echo tucked in most of our rooms to experience the amazing audio upgrade everywhere. and with the quality of audio dramatically improved, the multi-room music experience is amazing for both personal listening and entertaining. for us, having spotify and siriusxm synced everywhere in the house via a voice command or at the touch of an iphone button is fantastic!the only feature we are waiting for -- allowing an individual echo to be in more than one multi-room group. currently, you can only assign an individual echo to one group (e.g. everywhere). it would be great to assign each to everywhere, as well as a couple of other subset groups (e.g. a dining room/living room group for entertaining). but we know amazon will keep improving the feature set."
75,14,"overall, the echo is an excellent product to add to your home. when i heard about the echo back in 2014, i was very skeptical someone could come up with something useful for it to do unless you were entrenched in the smart home world. fast forward three years, and i currently own two echo dots and a regular echo. as long as you like music and even occasionally search the internet or set a timer, you will enjoy the echo.things i like:first off, when i was reading reviews trying to decide if i was going to purchase an echo or get a dot and a speaker, i read a lot of reviews that slammed the new echo for poor sound quality. i personally have not noticed any issues. it has a good amount of bass, and music sounds good at almost any volume level. is it a $500 home stereo system? no, but it is more than competent. for most music listeners. while you can buy a dot and a speaker, i would not recommend it simply because the echo is a much more streamlined and attractive way to listen to music.i own an iphone, and as pretty much everyone knows, siri is not exactly the smartest assistant out there. i can not compare it to the google assistant, but i can say that alexa is more than competent. there are only a couple of times where she has not had an answer for what i am looking for, but overall, she pretty much has a good answer. it is kind of silly, but one of my favorite things are her jokes. they are always a punny kind of funny, and it is one of those ways that amazon made sure alexa seems like a natural part of your home. the only thing amazon should add to the echo is the ability to search using bing. i say bing because google uses its own search engine for its home speakers, so amazon will have to turn somewhere else for searches. right now, the functionality is missing (as far as i know,) so adding at least some ability to search would put the echo that much further ahead of the google home.if you get an echo, you will more than likely get some form of smart home device. when i bought my 3rd echo, i got an offer to buy a tp-link mini plug for $10. i took the plunge and now use it to control the lamp next to my bed. overall, echo integration works well and makes lighting even more convenient. my favorite thing is the routines, where you can tell alexa a catchphrase and she will do several things at once. for example, i have it set so that when i wake up, i say ""alexa, good morning,"" and she will turn on the lights and begin my flash briefing. it is really a slick process that you do not realize how much you will use it until you have it in your home.things that need work:by far, the biggest con for echo users is the alexa app, at least on ios. setting up my echo, it could not connect to my home wifi network and failed three times. i had to use my phone as a hotspot and then come back in about an hour to connect it to my wifi network. when i am trying to pause music on the alexa app, it usually will not actually pause the music. it is not necessarily huge things that ruin the alexa app, but it is the sum of the little glitches that make it frustrating at least.the multi-room music works most of the time, but if one of the echos gets turned off, it messes the entire thing up.the way amazon has set up the households is annoying as well, mainly with relation to smart home. if you add a smart home device to one account, it will not automatically sync with the other accounts attached to your echo, meaning you have to manually add each skill, smart device, and routine to each account. i get why skills and music does not transfer between the two, but really amazon? if we are in the same house, we are going to use the same smart home devices. please fix!the smart home section of the app could use some beefing up. mainly, i want the ability to tell a group of lights to turn off at sunrise, on at sunset through the alexa app. can i do it through the individual apps of each device? yes, but it would be a lot more convenient to be able to take care of it all through the alexa app.overall, i really do enjoy my echo. the positives more than outweigh the negatives. if you have been wondering whether or not you are going to buy one for a while, take the plunge, especially with the $20 off deal going on right now. you will not regret it."
76,14,"bought this item to gift for my elderly parents who are not much into technology.  i was surprised about how excited they were to get it.  they had seen stuff about it on the tv but now they use it everyday.  it can do a lot of things but for elderly its perfect for weather, news, small facts, playing music, etc.product is of great quality.  it is heavy so it will not topple over easily and i can tell it is not cheap electronics.  for an item sub $100 this is a must buy.i easily got it working for my parents but they might have had trouble going through the process.  if you are under 50 and have basic knowledge of connecting to a wifi, then you will have no problem"
77,14,"when i first booted it up, i tried to see if the sound was as bad as people made it out to be but it was fine. it then updated to the 420 update that some people got to fix the sound issue. now the problem is, when i ask it to play music, it¡¯ll identify the song bu then take a couple seconds to actually play it then two seconds later, it will pause and then tell me something went wrong. the song is ¡°time stand still¡± by rush if that helps at all. man amazon, you really dropped the ball on this one...update: the issue i detailed above was actually widepsread for alot of amu subscribers and is now fixed. i am now experiencing an issue with the ambient noise function where it wont switch to the noise i want. i will ask it ti play rain, it will play it and then when i ask to play thunderstorm or any other ambient noise, it will listen to me and just resume the current ambient noise. the alexa app tells me that its playing what i want, but the echo itself is still playing the current noise i want to get out of."
78,14,"had a echo dot in our living room (connected to our bluetooth speaker) and really liked it. so we were really excited to have this 2nd gen echo in our kitchen. but for some reason this new echo is not working as well as our small dot in the living room. i sometimes have to shout ""alexa"" three times to get it respond to me. it loses connection to our home wifi network sporadically. and i definitely get more ""sorry i do not understand"" from this alexa... which i do not really understand--arent' they all the same software? or maybe this alexa does not like me as my old dot.the other thing is that we tried the home group function so we can sync music downstairs. however it does not work with our bluetooth speaker. once the echo and the dot are connected, the bluetooth speaker lost its connection to the dot. i checked online and people say amazon did this intentionally (which i do not really get why...) so for now, we had to say ""alexa stop"" in the kitchen before going to the living room and say ""alexa play..."" which is kind of weird.on the bright side the sound quality is good enough for us. we did not have the original echo so can not really compare with that... but the whole purpose of buying this is so we do not need to buy a separate bluetooth speaker and we are not really picky in terms of sound quality.if you do have a bluetooth speaker, i would say go with the dot."
79,14,"this is my first echo, so my review is not based on a comparison to the first generation.  in general, i still do not see the usefulness of the echo, google home, etc.  however, my household had a specific need for a compact speaker to play music.  the echo dot is sound quality would not have been good enough.  so at $99, this is a really good option.  as a smart speaker, it is really effective.  it is convenient to walk into the room and say ""shuffle this playlist"" or ""shuffle that album.""  the alternative is finding your phone, connecting to a bluetooth speaker, and starting playback.  i much prefer the echo for its wireless capability.  seems to get good wifi signal and has good sound quality.  i will be considering another for a different room."
80,14,"i love the echo, but come on...alexa does not know anything.  if you want a device that can answer questions for you this is not it. 90% of the time, even with basic questions, alexa says ""sorry, i do not know the answer to that"". if you want a device to answer all your questions,  a google home would be better suited.  also, thr smart plugs you can use in conjunction with alexa to turn your devices/ appliances on and off are completely worthless unless its a lamp or a very old appliance. unless there is a manual on/off switch (think 1970 is tv) you cant control it with alexa and a smart plug. appliances that have an on/off button and powers on electronically will not work  (so most everything).the sound on this is way better than the dot, so if you want to listen to music at all, i would choose this over the dot.overall, i still enjoy having the echo but it really doesnt do any of the things i bought it to do."
81,14,"no multi room spotify. all three speakers disappear from spotify. quick glitch / hiccup when sending audio to one of my three speakers (thinking this single unit may be defective). phillips hue also disappears. i would wait until the next generation of this model. i will be sending one speaker of three back. long time echo user.updated 12.4.2017: the sound is better than the echo dot, but no where near the original amazon echo. definitely not improved."
82,14,"the echo (2nd gen) is very similar to my echo (1st gen) with a sleeker design, better 360deg microphone, and (kinda) better speakers.yes, the speakers are an improvement but for crying out loud, amazon needs to listen to everyone is suggestions and add an equalizer to the app so we can choose the audio settings we want to listen to!!currently, the bass is just too overpowered. great job adding a decent bass for a tiny speaker but that does not mean you have to show off how well it works when i am listening to npr.  i have the echo in my bathroom which is a small room and this really makes the sound reverb which provides a less than pleasant experience when i am trying to listen to a person talking (imagine announcements you hear at a train station where everything just sounds like an echo but obviously much much less intense).add an equalizer. please. or at least bring down the bass."
83,14,"so i have had this almost three weeks now. at first when i got it as a gift, i was not sure i was going to keep it. i mean, what does it really do that is useful? some friends told me they used it to control their tv. great...a fancy clicker. but as time went on & i spent some time looking at her ""skills"" i have come to like her. like...not love, yet anyway.by far my favorite thing is her ""lists"". i added a shopping list & a to-do list. so if i am cleaning & running low on windex i just say, ""alexa, add windex to my shopping list"". cooking & getting low on flour? ""alexa add flour to my shopping list"". and she repeats it back to you. list is now in my phone, so no forgetting it at home anymore!! love this. worth the $100 just for this to me anyway. the ""to-do"" list is very good too, same sort of thing.i also use the calendar feature & she adds appointments to my phone calendar for me. the kids tell her their stuff too, so it goes on my calendar & i know what they got going on too. every am i ask her, ""alexa what is on the calendar today"" & she tells me. she always knows when it is going to rain too.hubby put the ""red alert"" sound (from the old star trek) in & he has her play that when he wants us to hurry up lol. i just ordered hubby the amazon dot which co-ordinates with alexa for christmas. this way when he is in his downstairs office i do not have to text him for dinner anymore. alexa & dot work together as an intercom.today i signed up for the 3 month trial of amazon music (99cents!). and i made an awesome christmas carol playlist. everyone from mariah carey & maroon five to johnny cash & bing crosby! sound quality is very good. however, since amazon music is $7.99 a month, i asked alexa to make a note on my calendar to cancel that right before the 3 months are up. hoping amazon realizes that is crazy monthly money before my trial is up so i can keep it. i think the yearly fee is less, so i will look at that maybe.she is very good at understanding what you say. even when you yell at her from the other room to turn the music volume up or down.i do plan to check regularly to see what ""new skills"" are added. how about one that has alexa make a note when i feed the dog & then will tell hubby when he gets home if i remembered to feed the dog or not? or tell me that if i forgot? there is something sort of like that on there now, but it gets bad reviews. so someone needs to make a better skill for that. my kids tell me there is a skill where alexa can send short texts to people for you. got to look into that.so, i like her, but do not love her. yet. i do think it is a good gift for someone who would like the ""list"" feature though. as long as they have smart phone & can use it to get the list up at the grocery store.update on 12/15/17 - still ""like her"" alot. got an app on it called ""dog data"" that let is you tell her when you feed or let out the dog & when hubby comes home he can check to see if the dog was fed or let out, even if no one else is home. the ""lists & calendar"" are the best & most used feature for me. love the sound on my christmas playlist, have it going all the time when i am home cleaning, cooking or wrapping look forward to seeing what else she learns down the road.."
84,14,"let me start by saying i initially went with a set of two google home units and four chromecast audio pucks to outfit my home for audio distribution  and home automation. i was very disappointed with the sound quality of the two home speakers. the chromecast audio units worked fine. the big problem: the software used/needed to drive the system while casting or listening to music would continuously crash.enter the amazon echo and alexa. i saw that amazon was offering the echo for $99, and if you buy three, they would take $50 off the total. if you signed up for the amazon.com store card they would give you an instant $40 gift card credit, along with 5% cash back on each purchase. well that meant i could buy three and only pay for two. i really only needed two, but what the heck. they are now selling for $79. if you are on the fence, stop reading this and buy one, or three (ha ha) before the price goes back up. come back when you have done that.unpacking was easy, not a lot of junk in the box. an echo, and a power adapter. some paperwork. that is it.i plugged her in, and alexa soon began giving me instructions on how to get up and running. turned on the alexa app on my iphone 6 and followed the instructions for getting her communicating through my home is wifi. initially the software seemed to have trouble recognizing my very long password (note: never use anything less than a 26 hexadecimal password.) after a restart she hooked up on the first try.my wife, son, and i began asking some of the suggested questions, and so far so good. we have had fun with the jokes, and i enjoy how the system integrates with our calendar app. most importantly though, was how alexa sounded. compared to the google home...wow!! i have two very high end systems in my home. my ears are very sensitive to differences in quality between speaker types and tonality. whereas the google home, with its single speaker element sounded flat and muffled, the echo is two element system sounds very bright and airy, with as much bass as you could expect from such a small package, and the highs are clear, not muddy at all. the echo gets louder too, with much more headroom at the higher volume levels. the echo is a very balanced little gem. i have no problem listening to the echo for a short period if i just want some ambient music in the background. it is not going to match the sonos, but then again it also costs much less.we have one upstairs, one on the main floor in the kitchen, and one in the basement. it is nice to be able to use them as intercom units. we can ""drop in"" on our son and his friends in the basement if we need to talk to them, or my wife can talk to me without having to yell from the kitchen or upstairs if i am busy downstairs or in the basement.alexa does have limitations and i can only hope the techies are working on them. my biggest gripe is that alexa does not recognize the phrase 'top pop clean' when i want to listen to that particular station. or any other 'clean' stations for that matter. you see, i am absolutely disgusted with the lyrics in many of todays new music tracks. i am not sure what changed to allow music to be published or broadcast with all the f-bombs you hear nowadays (with the exception of ""who are you"") but as long as there are people ignorant enough to buy that sort of trash, there will be a market for it. my point here is the programmers need to make the minor change to recognize when the word 'clean' follows a known amazon music station alexa should check the database for a [blank blank (clean)] option and either play it or come back with ""there is no option for a clean version of [blank blank] station. should i play it anyway?""using alexa to play pandora stations does not seem to have the above limitation.overall am very happy with the purchase. i really should only give it a four star rating due to the f-bombs we heard during testing of amazon music radio stations. otherwise it is definitely a five star product! i may get an echo dot or two for complete whole home coverage of audio.**update**  this morning, dec. 6, i asked once again, ""alexa, play my top pop clean station"". lo and behold! she recognized it! she responded, ""playing your top pop clean station."" awesome. i will experiment with the other clean prime stations to see if it was just a fluke later on."
85,14,"the first generation echo has been fantastic since day one.  whoever changed the equalizer settings on this second generation model made a huge mistake.  the speakers bass is turned up so high that all it does it thump and shake the walls next to it.  the sound of the singers in most songs is muffled and overshadowed by the alarmingly loud bass.  the speaker has great potential but there needs to be a way to adjust the settings.  i bought this to hear music more clearly (more treble).  but unfortunately, if i turn it up loud enough to hear it in the shower, my neighbors will complain because of how high the bass is.  it is a great speaker amazon, but without the eq being adjustable, its not for me.  why would anyone mess with the perfect settings of the original model???  so disappointing."
86,14,"what alexa can do across all models is well documented, so i will just comment on the echo is sound. i purchased this to  upgrade from our echo dot, which sounds awful on its own without an external speaker. upon first setting this up i was horrified to find it sounded little better than the dot. it was going to go back. but then the update came through. and it makes all the difference in the world. much, much better.the sound still is not top of the line mind you  - but it is good enough for the price. this will not compete with a sonos or the  google home max - but those cost 4 times as much. it is simply a classic case of getting what you pay for.  and here what you get for what you pay is pretty good.if you are looking for the best sound possible, look elsewhere. if you want alexa capability with top notch sound, just pair a echo dot with the high end bluetooth speaker of your choice. but if you are like me and you have a spouse who only wants to operate a single device and wants alexa, this is a happy compromise of good enough sound. just be reasonable with your sound expectations at this price point. i like it, and it is a keeper. one wish: make the equalizer settings amazon tweaked for the update available to owners."
87,14,"honestly, just buy it. if you are on the fence just buy it. we use it to allow elderly members of the family to call us without having to try dialing numbers they can not see or remember. we use it to listen to music. we use it for the lights in the house. we use it for the weather. we use it for the traffic. we use it for the news. we use it to get sports updates. we use it to tell jokes. we use it to play games. we use it for everything! every member of the family from age 6 through 91 loves it...and all of the ones throughout the house. it is a spectacular product and it improves every day. it is also extremely easy to use and very easy to set up. buy it!"
88,14,"we¡¯re pretty fully into the amazon echo is. we¡¯ve got two bigger echos and three dots. this was bought to replace a dot, and i have to say i¡¯m impressed.first off it looks so much nicer than the original. before the echo was very sterile looking. now it looks much more classy and inviting. almost like it belongs in the home / matches the decore much more seemlessly. the fabric is very welcoming and appreciated. the size is more manageable, too.we played the same song on both the new and old speakers. while it is not something that is going to blow you away, it is pretty significantly clearer, vocals are cleaner, and bass is more full. the sound was good enough for us to replace the one in the kitchen and move that one in the old dot location.it also has a coax connection for other sources as well. this is not something the original had, so that is a nice touch (even though most manufacturers are steering away from coax)the bad? i liked the volume ring that you could turn. i know it is one of those things that cost extra, and you can use your voice and the volume buttons, but i still enjoyed having the ring."
89,14,"i debated about getting an echo for a long time. i did not think that i needed it. now that i have it, i love it and planning to buy a second one for the house. as an avid music lover, having easy access to a wide variety of music is fantastic. my only concern is the sound quality with music only - the singers voice comes through crystal clear but the music, for a lack of a better description, hangs in the background. there is no balance but the difference is not so stark that it ruins the experience. i still like listening to music from it or streaming to other speakers. this issue did prevented me from giving the echo 5 starts. otherwise, i love access to alexa and the hands-free productivity it provides - creating shopping lists, setting up reminders, getting the news, weather, sports updates, amazon order updates, and more. i am becoming spoiled and cant wait to see how amazon improves the technology over time. also, for customers that care about the color of the cover, note that i purchased the grey heather but the grey leans more towards a bluish grey so it does not fully blend with my decor as planned. i had to move it to another part of the room as a result."
90,14,"recently bought an additional 4 alexas to total 5 throughout our home. changed our lives!!!!! use it 100% for the multi-room music functionality. comparable audio quality to sonos speakers, but <50% the price, and can take commands directly without an interface! no longer do we blast music in the living room to hear it in the kitchen or bedroom. we now have one in the bedroom, living room, dining room, kitchen, and bathroom. i would recommend an alexa in the bathroom more than anything. so nice to control music with my voice and hear some sweet tunes while i get ready for my day :) i have been known to buy a ton of random stuff (like 5 alexas....) and alexa is the one thing i would absolutely recommend to everyone, everywhere, always. new 2nd gen alexa regular is awesome looking with the sweet wrap.side note: now, add in spotify functionality for multi-room, and this will be over the top!!!!! (yes, spotify is not supported for multi-room, which is why i ended up also getting pandora premium). still worth every cent to have these babes lying around my house waiting patiently for me to return from work so they can take every command i can possibly think of.i love alexa"
91,14,"firstly i brought this item initially as more of a way of listening to amazon music and not for alexa. since having it a week im now jumping into the smart home world with tp-link smart bulbs and logitech harmony hub.so firstly the speaker. lets be honest straight from the off here, this is a sub $100 speaker, and in my honest opinion it out performs its price tag in this field. is it as good a bose or sonos.....no but why would you buy this thinking that in the first place. the echo produces a nice warm rich sound with some noticeable base that will please most average users who are not trying to wake up the neighborhood. more of a dinner party device than a house party, although the volume is quite surprisingly loud. i would rate this as a 8/10music integration with alexa. maybe she needs a little bit of work here. i saved playlists and when asking her to play them she sometimes just plays stations from amazon music that is is similar rather than the actual playlist. now i must state im british and have alexa set to american english so i have now changed that to uk to see if she understands me better - fingers crossed. 5/10 so farsmart home. i have been using tp-link bulbs with the kasa app and it works perfectly - super easy to set up in the alexa app and between the 2 systems im super happy. 9/10 (nothings a 10 right?)improvements to alexa.......volume profiles - it would be good to have alexa voice volume and music volume separate. can be annoying later in the day when you talk to her and the voice is shouting at you.multiple commands - asking her to do more than one thing at once. sometimes i want to turn the lounge lights on and turn them to a certain profile. you can say alexa do this and alexa do that, or alexa play this and alex turn volume up, and sometimes it works but most of the time it doesnt. thats a bit of a pain.stay listening longer. so i ask a question and she says ""sorry i dont know that one"" - not very helpful so i want to ask it again so she understands but she has gone sleep again so i have to say alexa to wake her. now this starts being a right pain after you want her to do multiple things and she gets them wrong as you can end up saying alexa 10 times in the space of a minute and that gets super annoying to the point i go over to the echo and press the button so i do not have to say alexa again. why cant she be programmed to say ""anything else i can help with"" and wait, after she does not understand a command instead of going sleep. pretty easy fix i think.overall though i was pleased i brought the echo and have since brought 2 dots for added smart home functionality. the speaker in the echo is great for ambient music but its no house party music machine if you want loud heavy thumping base."
92,14,"we have had her for a couple of months now and do not understand how we got along without her.first, she picks up our voice over the music and across the room quite well. my wife has to face her when speaking as she does not have a voice that carries like mine.second, the sound is really pretty good. for you audiophiles out here, no this will not be your music speaker choice. for the rest of us, this is a good music speaker. the speaker is loud and can over-power a room on full volume. a setting of 5 is more than enough for a bedroom.third, she is not google. do not expect her to be. she is a decent 'assistant' with various easy questions like what is 180 ml in ounces or setting timers. she is not going to be able to give you the average winter mean low temperature for las vegas. stop it!four, i like that the skills are growing almost daily. meaning that she will be able to do more with each passing day."
93,14,"the sound quality is quite good.  however, i have discovered that i much prefer the google home mini (which i received for free when i bought google is pixel 2nd gen. phone) because google is assistant is much smarter than alexa--at least in my experience.  many times i have asked alexa a question and get a ""sorry i do not know that""---or something to that effect.  i will then ask google home mini and same question and get an answer, sometimes quite a detailed answer.  i use echo in the kitchen for mostly setting timers and playing music.  even though the sound quality of the google home mini does not compare (much smaller than the echo thus the mini is speakers are small) to the echo, i am planning to move the echo to the bedroom and just use for a wake up alarm or playing music while getting dressed in the morning.  the google mini will be moved to the kitchen which is connected to my family room (where i usually hang out) because it will be more useful in getting information and the music sound is actually ok.  had i known the limitations of the echo (alexa) and how good the google assistant is on the google home,  i would have bought the full-sized google home and used my free home mini elsewhere."
94,14,"i¡¯ve had my  echo 2 for about a week now and pretty much concluded that i¡¯m going to return it, it is minor advantage of better sound is not enough for me to recommend it.there are several reasons for this.  first, i already own an echo dot and i find it better serves me than the echo 2.  the echo 2 does have better sound but for me this is unemportant since i mostly use the dot for podcasts and news where sound quality is not a factor, if i am going to listen to music i just turn on a spare sound bar in my living room and the dot connects and i have better sound quality than the echo 2, the two devices otherwise share exactly the same functionally.in the final score, all things considered, the echo dot is the superior device, at half the price. here is why:1. the dot is half the price2. about 1/4 the size3. performs exactly the same as the echo 24. uses micro usb cable & extensions for power5. can use any usb charger => 500 ma output6. can run off any usb 2000 mh+ battery that charges phones and tablets ($15 - $25.00)7. plugged into a battery it can run all day on battery alone, no hunting for a socket8. the dot is portable, the echo 2  ->  slaved to its proprietary power supply, is not.let me be honest.  from the second i saw that ugly wall wart and proprietary cable connector i hated the echo 2, i knew immediately, before turning it on that i was going to hate it because wall sockets are at a premium in my house.  worse, the sockets are almost always fully occupied, buried behind furniture and such.  early this year i changed most of the outlets in my house to ones that have usb sockets as well so i did not need to have extensions, socket adapters and so on, a ten foot after market usb extension cable can be had here for $5.00 at the local ¡°five below¡± store.none of this works for the echo 2.  with its clunky wall wart and a proprietary connector it is slaved to only the included power cord.  can not use it outside, can not use it anywhere without an outlet.had i been aware of this failing of the echo 2 i would not have ordered it, the far smaller, cheaper and much more flexible echo dot is simply a better choice. if i want to use it somewhere that has no wall socket i just plug it into one of my 8000 mh batteries, works for hours."
95,14,"i got this device two months ago, thinking it might double as a bluetooth speaker now and then as well as provide access to the hyped alexa skills.thus far, i am not using it all that much, although i appreciate being able to tell alexa to add items to my shopping list or give me the weather.but despite not using it all that much, the speakers are now problematic, garbling or distorting sound from time to time. i reboot and the problem goes away temporarily, and then the problem reappears.since the device is completely dependent on its speakers, it is obviously unacceptable to have the speakers go bad. and after only 2 months of light usage?i personally would just return the product and wait for a future version, but it is too late to return. (you have a month.) so i went looking for warranty service and the amazon setup to access this service is a convoluted set of pages with a lot of legalese and umpteen zillion links. why should it be hard to get support for a product that amazon is promoting to the max? i am currently waiting on amazon is response to my inquiries and may increase or decrease my rating depending on that response.one other warning: alexa at times starts speaking in the middle of the night. i do not know whether the device is reacting to a sound or informing me of an update, but i about crawled out of my skin the first time i heard that eerie voice in the night. now i try to remember to tell alexa to go to sleep at night.if you think you will actually use the alexa skills, you still might want this product. however, i strongly recommend that you use it mercilessly during the first 30 days so that there is time to easily return it if you get a dud.update (a day later): my entry of a 2-star review plus an email to amazon customer service resulted in a reasonable and fairly rapid response from amazon. you have to jump through some hoops because -- like all technical customer support services these days -- their procedures must assume that the customer is an absolute idiot to begin with. (""yes, it is plugged in."") i am now cautiously optimistic that amazon will improve the support pages to provide better instructions and response for those needing warranty support. i still think they should just use normal procedures to return/replace the echo for longer than 30 days, but they might get there.update:i have successfully contacted alexa customer support and a replacement is underway. amazon could improve support by including links to alexa customer support on their warranty information pages, and i hope they will do that at some point.for now, if you think you have a defective device within the warranty period, be sure to investigate and try any troubleshooting/fix tips that apply. always attempt a factory reset if only because amazon will ask if you did that before taking any action. (you can search for 'alexa support' in amazon is search bar to get to alexa help, which includes these tips.)once you have reached the point where you have tried everything, you should contact alexa customer support. here are the links that are valid for january 2018:by phone: https://www.amazon.com/clicktocall-alexasupportby chat: https://www.amazon.com/clicktochat-alexachatsupport"
96,14,"let me count the ways...she turns on and off our christmas lights, sets our alarms, reminders, schedules, to-dos, plays our favorite music and even reads to us.the only way she could get any better is if she had her own plugs and switches. its coming, alexa. its coming!<f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0089>seriously though, if you have thought about creating a smart home i encourage you to buy one and give it a go. we started with one. we ordered the echo dot, plugged it in for about 10 minutes, fell in love with it, and ordered one echo tower for dining room, master bedroom and my son is room. all the other rooms in the house have dots. my office has dots. my car has a dot. it just really allows us to use technology to our advantage!"
97,14,"really good device with a large, ever growing ecosystem of capabilities and connection options. really love how useful it can be, however, there are a few things of note:- google assistant is much better at understanding my voice, and interpreting what i mean. your mileage may vary of course (different accents), but alexa gets 3/5 for understanding me, and google assistant gets 4/5 (srini is 1/5 and cortana 2/5).- this specific device has had some challenges keeping a connection to my wifi (very rarely though), while my echo gen, and google home mini does not. maybe a slight defect, or further firmware updates needed in future (currently at lastest version) but still...the audio is much better than the echo gen. 1 which is really nice when listening to music, even though it is not a high end stereo system. overall i really like it and recommend."
98,0,what a cool product. its become our go to house music producer. we added the $4/month amazon music subscription with access to 10 million songs. you can ask alexa anything and get some pretty sweet answers. we love it.
99,14,"i own only apple products. i bought an echo 2nd gen a month ago for product red. i bought this one as gifts for family. i love this thing. it hears everything i say and almost never gets it wrong. opened me up to more smart home options that are cheaper than homekit. i love using it for lights, news, music, calling people, setting alarms, asking random things like ¡°are cashews health?¡± and it tells me detailed information. then it logs it all in the alexa app so i can look back at it. i can even give feedback if alexa did not do what i wanted. i¡¯m so unexpectedly in love with this thing that i went from 0 things in my home amazon to 6 echos. and then buying more as gifts for people who all love it. to give you an idea of how easy it is, my grandmother who is not great with technology can use alexa and actually enjoys it. (i set up the app she just talks to it). but the routines are my favorite thing. ¡°alexa good morning¡± my lights turn on, she tells me good morning and gives me the weather and my daily news."
100,14,"i am a new echo user, so i can not attest to previous versions that i see mentioned in the reviews. i am completely satisfied with both the sound quality and the function of the echo and alexa. the unit did receive and complete an update as soon as it was set up. the only issue i have had is sometimes it can not complete a task on the fire stick, such as opening netflix or finding a tv program. i do have my fire remote for that too, but it would be nice if it was a bit more seamless. i am hoping i just have not figured all the little voice command quirks out yet!"
101,14,"as a speaker its about what you would expect in the $75-85 range. has decent volume without distorting, but there is not much bass and the sound is not very even over the full spectrum.  but its very compact and looks good.alexa is always gaining new ""abilities"" but needs work on existing ones.  i ask alexa to play a certain playlist and with both spotify and amazon she plays a default one with a similar name.  close, but not exactly what i wanted.  there have been several incidents recently where alexa can not certain lights to turn on or off.  the app for the light can find them but it takes alexa a minute or two with 2 or 3 requests.  never used to have this problem.drop in and calling are really nice features but i wish amazon was more open about security.  i really would like to have at least some idea that i know who is really calling/dropping in and that there is no body listening in. also, even with people i know i would like the ability to not let them hear everything right away.alexa ability to recognize my voice is very impressive.  even with music playing (both on alexa and on home system) my voice is picked up and almost 90% of the time is understood correctly.shopping should be amazon best feature but it really needs work.  the specials have are so off the wall you really do not know what they are talking about.  since amazon sells the same item from several different vendors with different prices you have no way of knowing if you are getting the best since amazon defaults to the ""sponsored"" item.i do like the echo, just recognize that it usually costs less than $90 and that its features are not as great as amazon makes them out to be."
102,14,"while using the echo to play audible books the echo stopped working then would only play 2 words then quit. after contacting support i was told that he guessed the memory cache was full. my question is why and how did it fill and why is the memory cache not releasing no longer used memory? the answer i received was i do not know. i could not get a guarantee that it would not happen again. i am now returning this for a refurbished gen 1 echo. i have never had to go backwards in the world of technology in my life. amazon, this product is an obvious money grab you should be ashamed. end users, do not buy this product you will be disappointed.***update***after using the product and comparing it to the generation 1 version and the google home. i would have to say that this 2nd generation is a downgrade and not really worth it. i do not know if it is still learning speach but it has serious issues when telling it to play music or audio books. even when telling alexa to turn off certain hue lights she will occasionally tell me that the room i specified does not exist and she repeats the room name, i will then follow up with the exact same command and it works. the sound is no where near what the gen 1 was capable of.  the only advantage i would give it over the 1st gen, thats no longer available, is changable covers. if  you looking for alexa and a decent speaker, this is not it. it may cost a bit more but an echo dot connected to your speaker of choice would be a better idea. this part is specifically for amazon to address if they can or will. what exactly was upgraded from gen 1 to 2? the mic is do not work as well and the sound quality is awful. what was upgraded?  -  almost forgot, i called support for 30 minutes thinking the woofer was not functioning. fyi there is no diagnostic tool of any kind to tell if the mics and speakers are working correctly, you just have to assume."
103,14,"i like alexa service but i do not like this second gen device. it clearly says it has a new  better sound system in it, and i can honestly tell you it is crap,junk,and nothing there period. i guess you have to have a reason for the advanced version to exist . honestly i am disappointed in this because it is for sure not what they make it out to be improvement wise from the first generation. also , if i had known this i would have bought the older one.update:12/10/2017even with all the firmware updates to me the sound quality is just crap , there is no way around it. i wish i bought the echo dot and saved some money. the other thing this gets on my nerves is the mic pickup. it is junk also. i feel like i always have to yell at it."
104,14,this is our third echo plus a tap. love the new design and colors. it does sound better.  with all the new alexa features like drop in (intercom per se) and multi room music multiple devices work great for us. while i am writing this there is a buy 3 special. so tempted to replace the older 2 taller towers with new ones. at that price i just might. if you own an echo i will not rave about it you already know. if you do not own one spend a $100 and get one. trust me you will want to buy more. and check out alexa is skill set from making calls to prime music
105,14,"i saw no reason to get one. i have lived 60+ years without one. but then my 80+ yo friend raved about hers. she calls her friends, plays music, orders from amazon, etc. she had me over to show me what it could do. hmmm, it sounds darn good! and so easy.so i came home and ordered one. love it. no fumbling around with cds or lps on the stereo. no more radio stations fading in and out and with static. wow. the sound quality is good enough for me that i am seriously considering getting rid of all my stereo equipment and music collection. it is now all there in this little gadget. i have even re-ordered stuff from amazon through alexa - so easy. have yet to do phone calls, one thing at a time :)i have only one regret - that i did not order two while they were on sale."
106,14,"the amazon echo is wildly popular as a smart speaker. the price is great and it bolsters the similar echo dot four-button control interface (volume up/down, mute, command). the voice controls seem to work well and alexa is surprisingly good at taking commands, even when the music is playing.if you¡¯ve thought about adding a smart speaker to your home, this is a great purchase. if you¡¯re already an echo owner and you¡¯re considering adding more, the second-gen echo is at a great price to do so. it is also a great gift idea for anyone. the joy of ¡°ask me anything¡± at your beck and call!while amazon has made it intuitive to use and set up, you will need to go through some steps to personalize your alexa. similar to setting up siri on a much larger scale, this is easy to do with the alexa app. the 2.5-inch subwoofer and 0.6-inch tweeter, provides great sound in any location of your house. to my knowledge, you can use music streaming services like spotify and pandora to play music. we¡¯re already amazon music subscribers, so it is simple to use voice-commands to play tunes from our playlists or recommended stations. you also have bluetooth connectivity and an auxiliary outlet for hard-wired connections.one of my favorite features, is to ask alexa to tell you jokes or to play games, like jeopardy. we also, as a family, enjoy having alexa tell our kids to do things by simply saying, ¡°alexa, simon says, tell isabella to eat her vegetables or no dessert.¡± then, alexa promptly repeats your command to your daughter to eat all of her vegetables. lol!if you found my review to be useful, please let me know by clicking the ¡°yes¡± or ¡°helpful¡± button. thank you."
107,14,"first, an fyi: the sound issues have been addressed as of firmware update 592452420.with this firmware update, the bass response is now much improved, and turning up the volume will not make your ears bleed with screeching, tinny highs. almost literally a night and day improvement! really; it appears that my echo received the update overnight.in my original review, i had compared this echo to our echo dot + vaux speaker and a friend is 1st generation echo. while i have not repeated a side-by-side test with the 1st gen, i again compared it the echo dot + vaux speaker setup and (perhaps unfairly) another echo dot paired with a bose soundlink mini ii. the echo now sounds better than the vaux speaker and, surprisingly, can decently hold its own against the bose speaker! to my ears, the mids and highs of the echo are now about as clear as the soundlink is. it is only outperformed by the bose on the low end, but that is to be expected when pitted against a speaker that is close to $200. still - like i mentioned earlier - the bass response on the echo is now greatly improved and helps to create an overall richer, fuller sound. it is now a respectable smart speaker fit for music enjoyment.also noteworthy is that its listening capabilities appear to be improved. this echo can hear you from surprising distances, even if you are not projecting toward it or are speaking from the next room. it is also good at hearing you over pretty loud music. (unless, of course, it is blaring; then you will have to scream at it or speak very close to the microphones.)i was so close to returning this echo after being disappointed with audio performance that did not sound ""improved"" at all. i have to say i am impressed with amazon is prompt action to resolve an issue on a product that has not even been out for an entire week!"
108,14,"really love the echo!  it is great for us seniors who rely on lists and reminders to keep us organized.  just tell alexa ""add flour to shopping list"" and instantly its there.  no more losing my shopping list as it is always on my phone.  also love asking for any kind of music i am in the mood for. i can tell her ""play some soft rock from the 70 is"" and she finds the best.first thing in the morning i ask for the weather and news to get the day started.  when i am cooking, i ask her to ""set the timer for 30 minutes"" and it is done!  i plan to order the smart bulbs for my lamps next so i can tell her to turn lights on/off.i also want to get a smart thermostat so i can tell her to turn the heat/air up/down.  she can do many other things, i just learning:-)"
109,14,"i like the sounds over the echo dot but it does not hear that well. the software is just not there yet.you have to know exactly what to say or it will not do what you want.ex:  turn on amazon fire tv, will switch but any of the following will not do a thing:change to fire tvswitch to fire tvturn on living room amazonturn on living room for fire tvopen youtube on fire tvdevice often mishears what you say or cannot hear you because it is volume is too loud."
110,14,"i love this little guy.  after returning beats solo 2 headphones (painfully tight) and a bose soundlink color 2  (not so good),  i purchased this echo from staples (did not want to possibly return a third item to amazon).  i do not have a lot to say except that i am so happy with it.  of course its only been one day, so time will tell.  i think the sound quality is very good.  the hands free aspect is great, play a song, set a timer, set an alarm,  reminder,  whats the weather,  get the news,  how many teaspoons in a tablespoon,  you get the idea.  the best yet for me is the ability to tell it to make a phone call.  what a wonderful feature for someone who lives alone.  i am no audiophile but to me it sounds better than the bose.  all in all, i think this is a great buy especially now when its on sale."
111,14,"this is not the glowing review amazon hops for.  i have been trying to hook alexa to my sonos speaks for 2 months now.  still not working.  i have contacted sonos and amazon.  i have gone through all the steps both have suggested and still not working.  i am so tired of this!!!  alexa talks too fast and just mumbles when you ask her things.  you ask her to repeat and you have to go through the whole initial asking of the questions, again.  she is not conversant like google devices.  alexa is wordy when you ask her to set a timer and wordy when you ask her to play music even telling you she does not see any speakers.  alexa has difficulty responding to wake command must be repeated several times.  if she is learning, she is very, very slow.  i hear of people setting these devices up easily but if there are glitches, there is little help and it is incredibly time consuming (2 months so far).  i¡¯m thinking in another day or two, i¡¯ll just pack up the three devices and send back to try google home.  costs the same and they are supported with better phone support via costco.  sonos speakers still work via my smart devices, just not via voice commands on alexa.  converting to a smart home is expensive and time consuming.  there should be some extra help for those of us who seem to be challenged in this area.  bottom line:  very little support other than unplugging and reinstalling standard emails from amazon.....i¡¯m of to uninstall, reinstall, unlink, unplug, reboot, plug, relink, delete, and set up once again.................you decide if that is a simple, easy and convenient process........."
112,14,"if you are concerned about sound please read the following:tldr: amazon sent out a firmware update that significantly improved sound ( the reviews that say the sound sucks are from before this update)i had initially bought the sonos one (alexa built-in) and even though the sound was amazing it was not responding to ""alexa"" well. i saw that target had a cyber monday deal on all echo devices. so i said that i will buy it and if the sound is as bad as the reviews made it out to be i would return it. during setup input the echo beside the sonos speaker and was testing the wake word sensitivity (obviously the echo won in this respect). then i tested music on both. i was really disappointed with the echo as i have the first generation echo and the 2nd gen was significantly worse. at this point i decided that i would have to return and see if sonos upgrades their wake word sensitivity. then the echo does an update. just to try it one more time i play music again initially on the echo. as music starts playing on the echo i was amazed (i went back to the spotify app to switch the speaker to the echo as i had thought i was playing it on the sonos). i went back between the echo and sonos a few more times and regarding the sound, it was really close! if the song that you are playing does not have bass, the speakers are almost indistinguishable! if it does have bass obviously the sonos is better. if you are just a casual music listener there is really no reason to go with the sonos as the echo is amazing despite what the review say, as they were probably posted before the firmware updates."
113,14,"this is a terrific product and a very good value. the sound is excellent. of course it can not keep up with high end speakers, but it was never meant to do that. i have a couple of these as well as four echo dots. i use them all the time to add items to various lists (groceries, etc.) that then show up on my phone when i am, out shopping. great feature. i ask it all kinds of questions and she is very responsive. i play a news podcast every morning. i can ask her what is on my calendar and she will tell me. i also use her to turn lights on and off. but i mostly use her for music. i use amazon music for this as it does not work with itunes. alexa will occasionally fail to understand what you are saying to her, which can be frustrating, but voice recognition has not been perfected. however, this rarely happens and, as a baby boomer, the level of technology is, in my opinion, quite remarkable.one problem arises from the multi-room music feature. first, you can put each echo in only one grouping. sometimes i want the music playing throughout the house while other times i just want it to play downstairs. the app will not allow me to put the same device in two different groups. second, and this is the most frustrating, the music will often just stop playing when it is playing in more than one room. i spoke with amazon about this and they said they are aware of the problem and are working on an update for this.one other minor issue. she wakes up when you say her name (you have a few choices here). sometimes she will hear her name and wake up when you are just having a normal conversation or when watching the tv. she will even do this when a word is spoken that is close to her name. she is very sensitive and she will respond when you speak in a normal voice."
114,14,"i had owned the original echo and abandoned it because it would go off and start talking randomly in the middle of the night.  far to creepy for my needs.  when i found out that the echo could now read my kindle books it made me want to try it again. i have to say i am somewhat disappointed.my 1st gen had decent sound, not bose quality mind you, but it was good. this 2nd gen sound like alexa is in a box reading the books to me. there are also very long oddly placed pauses between reading lines and alexa will just stop for no reason. the pauses, as annoying as they are, i can live with as those did improve with the software update (they are still there, but appear to be getting better), but the sound quality is so disappointing that i think i am going to return this and pick up a dot an just connect it to my own speaker.  why should i pay $99 for subpar sound."
115,14,"i started looking at the echo when it first came out, i was immediately fascinated with it, but decided to hold back, mostly because of the price point. i decided that for christmas and my birthday (just a few short weeks after christmas) i was going to get one. instead of searching my wish list for the echo i had added long ago, i decided to just search for it. and so glad i did, because the 2nd gen popped up, and at a smaller price point at that (i did pick up when on discount for holiday after all). i anxiously awaited the delivery, which happened to be a day earlier that what i was told it would be, and i immediately tore into the package as soon as it arrived. i have been loving it. i use it to set up a backup alarm to wake up to, i get my news flashes from alexa, ive played trivia with alexa, and she is great at helping find just the right music to listen to. oh, and did i mention, she can control my fire tv as well!! i have loved it so much, i decided to look into the echo dot to put throughout the house, especially the kids room so that i do not have to leave my phone in there playing music till they fall asleep when over at my house. so the new year comes and goes, and i decide that i was pretty good the previous year, and my birthday was in just a couple weeks, i went ahead and bought 2 echo dots to go with it. the only regret so far is that my 5 year old daughter will not quit asking alexa to tell her jokes lol. i highly recommend. it has great sound, alexa is awesome, and the new and improved design makes it great in any decor."
116,14,"even though i am the ultimate tech geek and tend to buy whatever the latest in consumer electronics, i have been skeptical about the amazon echo ever since it was released. why buy one of these when you have your well-established siri, cortana, and google assistant -- which have been around for years. moreover, why should i complicate my life with yet another set of unique communication protocols?well, when i was offered a substantial discount through audible, i decided to give echo a try.with the first couple hours of interacting with alexa, i had my epiphany. alexa trumps the other interactive technologies in big audacious ways:1) the fact that it is always on and listening makes a huge difference. no buttons need to be pressed. yes, you might say that you can do that with siri. but there is a huge difference. where it trumps ""hey siri"" is its listening technology when enables to me to say ""alexa"" from across the room, when music is playing, in the same way i would call out the name of someone in my family. believe me...this makes a huge difference in the user experience.moreover, siri is impatient and often misinterprets what you are saying. alexa is right on the money i would say around 90% of the time.2) the skills that come standard are pretty much in line with what the other voice assistants have. and...while there are a lot useless 3rd party skills, if you do your homework, you will find some solid gems by browsing for ""best skills lists have been compiled by various websites.""3) if you love music, you are in for a treat. the speaker is awesome, given the size of this cylinder. initially, i paired it with a humongous bluetooth speaker i own. however, now i mostly use the echo is built-in speaker. the sound is easily within the realm of ""dedicated mid-sized bluetooth speakers"" that amazon sells that you would pay $150 bucks. i love edm, jazz, and metal, but the true measure of how great the speaker is that i also enjoy listening to classical on it as well.moreover, the kicker is that you just say, ""alexa play some bach choral music,"" and she plays it using the music service of your choice. you do not have to open your phone and dig through playlists. the music just plays.if you are wondering if this device is for you, i would say you are coming in at a good time. the echo is in his 2nd generation. initial bugs are squashed, and the sound is great.this is is one of the greatest things i have purchased in 2017."
117,14,"i have used the echo dot for over a year, primarily to play music. as a musician, sound quality is very important to me so i have my dot plugged into a good sound system. upon seeing ads that the new echo 2nd gen had improved sound quality, i thought i would give it a go and if it failed to meet my standards, i would just gift it to someone. i am shocked and amazed at the sound quality of this little thing! it is honestly almost as good as the system i had my dot plugged into. i am definitely keeping this little gem!  also very handy for dumb questions like ""how may tablespoons in a quarter cup"", etc. i tried the read my book function and that also works very well!  next to smartphones, microwaves and other innovations, i predict that these things will become integral to all households very quickly! i would give this thing 10 stars!"
118,14,"<u+00a0>oh my goodness! warning i am a huge alexa / echo fan lol. i have been since the first one came out and it just gets better and better. this one looks amazing and sounds amazing. the only thing i miss is the turn top for the volume. i really love that on the plus but it is just beautiful. it was so easy to setup and going. found all my lights fast and boom it is a new addition to the family haha.the material is really great. i do hope they make the 3rd gen where you can swap the fabric as needed like the dots but it is so stylish. the blue ring is in full glory as well ;) hey i warned you i am a huge fan haha.look on youtube under zachus, there is a video where you can see the size. it is about half the size of the original. i do a side by side comparison and show you what is in the box."
119,14,"the sound quality is just above the dot, and well below the echo. it does have the ability to pick up your voice even when playing music, which is great. but since the sound quality is so poor i will not be listening to music on it. i am so disappointed in amazon for touting it as quality sound technology. it could have been much better. it should have been much better. everything other than the sound quality is great. i put the device inside a large bookcase and it sounded a little better - less tinny. having it sitting on an end table or desk makes the sound unacceptable. **** update: i received a call from amazon indicating a downloadable update for the echo is available. so now the sound is better, for certain. i dinged them one star because i pre-ordered the device and received it on the first day it was available. so why does a product need a software update on day one? plus, even with the update, the sound is not ""improved"" over the original echo. but to their credit, they placed a personal phone call to me to advise of the available update. it is enough of an improvement that i am not sending it back.****"
120,14,"since i probably can not say much of anything that anyone else has not said a million times over, i will come at this from the perspective of someone who never had the echo on their radar; i was given this as a gift and thus came in with nothing more than a cursory understanding of what it was and no real super driving interest to even have one. well, one month later and i am so sold that i have installed compatible lightbulbs all over the house, am deep into researching which compatible thermostat i am going to upgrade to, and bought an echo dot for the master bedroom. i dove into all the details, setting up keyphrases to control multiple actions at once, taught it my voice, set up a ""household"" with my wife, connected all of our calendars and music stations, and generally embraced it wholly.i am really happy with the availability of compatible home devices. i already had a compatible home security system (thankfully), but the first handful of things i began looking for in order to complement the device were readily available. obviously this is because so many things are made with the echo directly in mind, but again, from someone coming at this with only a rudimentary understanding this was a big deal on my journey. had i not found, or not easily found compatible devices this may have just sat in the box for who knows how long.the only negative i can give it is that it took, and appears to continue to take, a lot of time time fully recognize our voices. i understand this is a new-ish function which is still developing and that you need to interact with it a lot in order to fully lock it in, but it is the reality nevertheless. at first it would just forget our voices immediately, then it would only remember them in one account instead of in both, then it would remember them for some time and forget again, but after a while it is getting way better and it seems to finally remember both voices.oh, one thing i would definitely like to call out is that i am actually astounded at how good the sound quality is. i am no audiophile but this is easily the best small speaker i have ever heard. music sounds richer on this than you would expect. i was completely shocked.i have recommended and will continue to recommend this to anyone who is interested, with the caveat that the voice recognition still seems to have a few bugs to work out."
121,14,"these are great for sharing music across multiple rooms, and for having alexa available in those rooms.  some things you need to know though.* although this supports playing music in multiple rooms, it appears that alexa only allows each room to be in a single group.  so if i have a speaker in my study and sometimes i want to the music shared there sometimes, but not always, i can not do that.  i also have not yet found an alexa command that let is me take existing music and just add a speaker to it, or expand it to a larger area (i.e. ¡°alexa, play this music in the study too¡± or ¡°alexa, play this music in the downstairs group¡±) - instead you have to restart the music you¡¯re listening to (i.e. ¡°alexa, shuffle bob seger songs downstairs¡±). ¡®* the speaker quality in this is pretty high quality.  i¡¯ve gone through probably a dozen bluetooth speakers, some of them quite expensive, and i think i¡¯ve only heard one (jbl) that was higher quality.  with that said, if you want even higher quality, you should consider sonos speakers with alexa built in.* alexa itself is good, but not great.  if you¡¯ve never used voice commands, you may experience some frustration with alexa.  but if you only want to use this to play music in multiple rooms and for simple tasks (i.e. ¡°set a timer¡±) then you¡¯ll be pretty happy with these."
122,14,"throwing my hat into the ring, this device is awesome. i have had the echo 1st gen for about a year. when i first wrote amazon about the speaker quality (i could not connect a bluetooth speaker to the echo 1st gen and i was not happy with the music quality) they told me i was the first complaint they would heard about sound quality. flash forward a year later and they developed an enhanced sound system??? amazon is awesome??yes- the speaker is better. the unit is shorter. she is a bit more responsive to my voice commands while playing music but let is be honest ... hahaha ... get the remote if you need to hail her over loud music across the room. i really can not say enough about how awesome this helper is ... there are plenty of features to use and they are developing more all the time. the best thing of all is they are really responsive and will develop new features as needed.i am really looking forward to the ""drop-in"" and calling features, but i cannot consume these workloads without an ios or android device app and i""m a 100% all windows girl. still there is loads she does for me -- but more often than not i use alexa to:stream music from amazoncontrol my home lights using insteon hub (<<< cannot say enough about how awesome this is ... total game changer)set timers when i am cooking"
123,14,"i love the product, but it took a bit of tweaking to get it installed. and that is the only reason i am not giving it 5 stars. i expected a glitch or two, but i did not expect the rudeness of the customer service rep who answered my first call. she implied i was too stupid to use the device and insisted i get a neighbor to help me set it up. she even argued with me over whether the color ring was yellow or orange! i was so furious i threw the whole thing in the trash, but found that it was quite well-built and survived my temper tantrum very well. the second csr had me turn off wi-fi to the house and reboot it, explaining that some wi-fi systems will reject a second wi-fi stream that is added when they are in use. now i love it and am more than pleased with the sound quality and the ease of communication. amazon needs to fire the csr is who start all conversations with the assumption that amazon customers are morons!"
124,14,"it is really good for home automation. it is not so good for searching. i had some family over that wanted to know what time a game started. we tried all kinds of way of asking alexa when does the game come on. fail!i decided to pop up my android phone and ask google what time does the specific game come on and google came back on the first try with the correct game, and even the score.it just goes to show you have to know what you want from a device like this. although the voice assistant is not as good as google, i have experience with amazon hardware versus google hardware. amazon is usually rock solid stable, versus google is perpetual beta system. google also has a tendency to kill things, and while i would not put that past amazon, its highly unlikely that they will kill off alexa. amazon also innovates a lot quicker than google (and others) when it comes to these things. they invented this space after all. how long will it take others just to come out with a buggy video version, and amazon already has about 3 producs with it (spot, echo look, and echo show).either way, if you are home automation focused, i would go amazon because it has more support and is probably going to come out with more innovative ideas. if you want something you can talk to like an assistant, probably best to look elsewhere."
125,10,"i have to learn to use it for everything it can do.  i also have an echo dot that i keep in the bedroom and they do basically the same thing except the sound on this one is booming!  nice subwoofer.  i play music when i am cleaning house.  play ambient sounds when i am reading.  turn on gadgets.  play games with it.  it is not just for fun and games, it is a good assistant for checking the web and keeping appointments.  i like it a lot and it was easy to set up."
126,14,"i have all the echos from the first one sold originally only to prime members to both generations of dots.  this one has two excellent features.  the primary one is the better sound. i listen to audiobooks, so did not really think i would notice a difference, but indeed, i can understand the narrators even better (i have some hearing loss).  those low tones really help. still, it is not as good as a high quality speaker, so please just have modest expectations.  i also like the wider selection of covers.  since i have no reason to touch my solid black echos, fingerprints have never been a problem.  however, i do really like the shorter version next to my chair (less chance of cat knocking it over) and the grey fabric looks great.  instead of stand-out tech, it melds into the background.many of the features that this echo has they have added to the other echos and the 2nd gen dot such as multiple alarms and timers.  so, i really appreciate the ability of amazon to keep improving on what you already have.  except for ordering ink and certain specials via alexa, i do not actually order stuff through the unit because typically, i order 3-5 things at once, not just one.if you already have an echo 1st generation, other than being shorter and having finish options, there is no real improvement in features.  but the price is good and now i have 3 echos. with the dots, that covers my living space pretty well so i have audiobooks and music everywhere."
127,14,"we got the echo (2nd gen), plus we have the 1st generation, and in the right room/space, the new one is sound is perfectly acceptable, and we are always trying for better sound at reasonable prices. echo 2 does not compare to ""higher-end"" devices/music setups/speakers, (and that is not a claim from amazon). it is good...good enough not to be distracted by the quality of the sound. we own extreme music components and still have no problem with the sound of echo 2 because it is very good sound for what it is. what we did have a major problem with was setting up our the echo (2nd gen), following the same directions multiple times. i use a lot of tech with no problem. the setup of an echo could/should be easier and less ambiguous. some things in the alexa app is instructions need to be much more clear about what the next step is. it may have just been connection problems, but it was not until my 5th try that it finally hooked up. that is just crazy.overall, we like the 2nd gen echo quite a bit. i gave the device 4 stars (it is really 4.5) because of setup mania and the fact that the sound is better on the 2nd gen, but not a lot better than the 1st generation. that said, though, $99 is an absolute steal for the quality of this device. highly recommend."
128,14,"overall, about what i expected. offers ability to link up with amazon fire stick- allowing for searches and access to amazon music and prime video with which it meshes pretty well. needs some work in interfacing with other third party apps available with the fire stick. for example, it can bring up apps like hulu and netflix via voice command, but can not search by voice command internal to those apps.i liked it is ability to add ""skills"" to the echo. these add features to what the echo can do. would really like an echo software upgrade in the future to make accessing these skills more user friendly.  for example to use a particular weather app currently, you have to say something like, ""alexa, ask weather app 12345 what the winter road conditions  are like?"",  instead of  being able to simply say. ""alexa, what are the road conditions like?""the set-up for  the echo presented some challenges.  in my case, the set-up was done through the amazon alexa  iphone app. the set-up using the app tries to walk you through the steps to link your smartphone and devices like your amazon fire stick, but as you progress, and encounter issues, the app refers to non-existent help pages within the app.  for example, when the app failed to register the echo, it referred to a help page i could not locate on the app. i had to do a google search to troubleshoot the issue. another improvement to the setup, would be to explain why you are linking your smartphone, etc. via bluetooth, while also connecting the echo to wi-fi. it was not clear which of these steps were necessary. the setup app also mishmashes terminology that is confusing, using ""echo"" and ""alexa"" interchangeably as you navigate the rough the setup.other upgrades that would be nice:being able to use any word as a wake-up word. currently, just ""alexa"", ""echo"", ""computer"", and a few more.allow alexa to have other accentsability to follow-up on questions alexa  answers without having to say ""alexa""  again, for example, make this possible:you: ""alexa, where is the nearest pharmacy?""alexa: ""the closest is walgreens at 123 maple street""you: ""is there a cvs nearby?"""
129,14,"i bought this to complement the half dozen echo dots i bought to achieve multi-room audio. i have a number of logitech squeezeboxes, but when logitech dropped spotify (huge mistake) that created a problem. my solution was to buy the dots to get multi-room spotify, then plug them into the back of the squeezeboxes via a short 3.5 to 3.5 cable. this was a very good and cheap solution for me. the only problem was that i wound up with two things to plug in, and in the dining room (where i could not hide the cables) it looked messy. so, i opted to try the echo. i read reviews saying that the sound quality was not up to much, so i had pretty low expectations, but i was very pleasantly surprised at how good the echo sounds. not quite as rich as the dots plugged into the squeezeboxes, but good enough. plus, echo has tone controls, which the squeezebox never managed.the multi-room audio works great, by the way. there are some limitations on designating a device to be in more than one group (a ""premium"" feature, i understand), but that has not caused a practical issue. i really think the echo and echo dot are both terrific products and excellent value for money. bluetooth implementation is solid. i only wish that there was some way of having my collection of speakers connect to my enormous itunes library, but i think that is a political rather than a technical problem and may never be solved. fortunately, that is where my squeezeboxes come into their own, though it means having to fire up my logitech media server, which is sometimes inconvenient.the only thing i do not like is that amazon dropped the prices right after i bought the echo and the echo dots!!! any chance of a credit, amazon?"
130,14,"i was not sure if we would really get our money is worth out of this.  this was our first experience with this kind of device. the sound is amazing and worth paying more money than the echo dot.  the app is also easy to use. just being able to play any radio station at will makes it worth it, as there are no more fights over the kitchen radio on who changed the station.  it is funny when it hears its name from the tv it does sometimes turn on. i use the recipes feature for the first time last week and found a better way to make hard-boiled eggs and it worked really well. love the fact you can set up in a daily briefing to get whatever news and/or weather and/or traffic updates while you pour your morning coffee or tea. i do find it does save some time of running back and forth to the computer to look things up. there are many third-party apps you can install to integrate things like games or credit card billing information but i have not done that. you can also set it to mute so it does not listen if you discussing personal information that you do not want your device to hear. i do frequently use and pass on the bad jokes it tells. i can easily see why people buy more than one and put a unit in multiple rooms. overall we really like our echo 2."
131,14,"for now i am just going to say that for the few things i am doing it is awesome. i just set it up yesterday. took me a while because i missed a few steps but over all set up was painless. i have only used the echo to add items to my shopping list, get the news, play music from my amazon music and ask basic meassuring question. because it is the new toy in the house we have been asking lots if questions and only once alexa has replied she...it did not know the answer. i think after a while, after i learn all the features echo has to offer, i will be able to write a better review. i do reccomend others to get one. in fact, i will by one for my daughter when she moves to her college dorm. or give her this one and buy me a new one <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0081>"
132,14,"my nephew gave me one of these for christmas 2017.  had i known how handy it is, i would have already bought one, and now i intend to place them throughout my house.  the only reason i did not give five stars (yet) is because there is still a bit of a communication problem.  it seems to be able to answer almost any question, once i figure out how to ask the question in a way it understands.  i predict that will improve, and then i will definitely give it five stars.  it can give me information about almost anything i want to know, or play music by anyone i want to hear.  i can use it to wake me up at any time i choose, or give me traffic or weather conditions. it can tell me where and what time a movie is showing, or television program. i am told it can also interface with bluetooth smart devices i.e. thermostats, lights, etc. to allow me voice control over them.  when i was a kid there was a futuristic cartoon series called ""the jetsons"".  george jetson would come home from work and give voice commands to his computer ran home, and it would immediately comply and do whatever he commanded.  i thought, such a thing will never happen, but here it is in alexa, and it is great!"
133,14,"(original review was 2 stars - lowered to 1 on updates.)the claim about ""improved sound"" is untrue.  the sound is better in the original echo.  this is not a variation of quality issue - all three of the new units i received had tinnier sound than the original.  the only reason i am keeping them is the external audio jack, since bluetooth pairing does not work with multi-room audio yet.updates:1. it turns out that amazon was well aware of the sound deficiency, at the same time they were advertising the echo as having ""improved sound"" everywhere.  after posting this review, they contacted me and made me aware that they had attempted to tune the sound via software after the first units were shipped.  too bad i had already spent money on external speakers.  it would have been nice to tell their early customers about what they knew, and were doing about it.2. when these went on a lower sale for black friday, i called to see if amazon would at least match the price they were now offering.  after 30-40 minutes on hold and talking to four different people, they disconnected, with no call-back.  returning all three echos.  save your time and money."
134,14,"i already had a 1st gen echo and a few echo dots.  the new echo is sound (after late 2017 updates that increased bass) is horrible compared to either.  the bass is now boosted unpleasantly heavy and boomy/out of balance, and there is no way to adjust the bass to a more reasonable level.  if amazon does not update it very soon with a fix to tone it down i will definately have to return it for refund <u+2014> i¡¯m better off without it.i was much happier with the original 1st gen echo is sound and even the dot did a reasonable job at its price point & size category.  i really hate it when products overblow bass, especially when they can not even produce a full bass range.  there is a place for a cheap boom-box but it is not in my echo."
135,14,"i purchased this intending for it to be a family christmas present.. but once it arrived.. i kept staring at the box because i knew what was inside. we eneded up opening it the same same. i bought the dot along with it. i love that the echo can do so many things. i can be in the kitchen cooking, use it to set my timers and listen to music without having to stop what i am doing. i love that it has an alarm feature. the bonus was discovering all the educational features my son can use as well as the games. we have been having a blast playing some of the games. so glad i made the decision to purchase this."
136,14,"new echo is pretty much like the old echo. it is fun and interesting. we have a large family & big house so we gave an echo to each kid and we can use the ""drop in"" feature to communicate like an intercom. ""hey kid, come down to dinner!"" and this works well. in general we use it mostly for music although the sound is just so so. it is not intended to be premium sound quality and it is not. if you want great sound quality look elsewhere. please note that with a large family, you will need unlimited music service as amazon has gotten very greedy with the prime music service. you can only play prime music on one device at a time now so if you have 4 kids & many echo is, that means music can only be played on one device and not simultaneously on the others. with prime you can play the same song on all devices at the same time if they are all on the same account but this is useless for families. the unlimited music family plan is $150 per year for 6 people. so amazon knows the echo is the ""hook"" to the $$$ music plan. but we love our music & we feel music is important for the kids so we feel it is worth it. also, my kids probably listen to the music more thru their phones & headphones on the amazon music app than thru the echo."
137,14,"i am fully supportive of the amazon ecosystem. i own kindles, fire tablets and both a 1st gen echo and 1st gen dot (neither of which has given me any issues). technically speaking, even after a firmware update, this 2nd gen echo is still freezing when issued commands (sporadically but daily) and the audio quality is lacking as compared to the 1st gen echo (yes, i do understand that the 1st and 2nd gen echoes are designed differently). i am conflicted and confused... as all publicity and everything leading up to the release of this generation of echo would indicate that this model would be equal to or even surpass the 1st gen echo. sadly, this does not appear to be the case. for those that are curious, yes, it has the latest firmware, as of the writing of this review... and i have deregistered and factory reset this 2nd gen echo several times... with the same results. as i wrote earlier... i remain conflicted about this device. i have high hopes for it... but, at present, i am not sure where my confidence is with it."
138,14,"the echo has fairly good sound for its size and price; i think it is a little heavy on the bass, but otherwise i have no complaints. i do not use my echo to listen to music, just audiobooks and sleep sounds, so i do not need it to have top-end audio.alexa is more useful than i was expecting. when the first generation echo first came out, i really wanted it, but could not justify the absurd price for something that really did not need dedicated hardware. after letting my initial excitement cool down, i realized i could not think of many ways i would actually use a voice assistant. i ended up buying the 2nd generation mostly to use for audible audiobooks, but i have found that i also like using alexa to set alarms and to check the weather.unfortunately, alexa is very buggy, which is the mean reason i have knocked off two stars. when i am listening to audio books, alexa frequently stops responding and i will have to unplug my echo to reset her and get her working again. there are some sleep sounds which alexa let me play once, but will not play anymore - when i ask her to play them, she does not respond and nothing happens. lastly, some of my echo settings have randomly changed themselves without my input."
139,14,"ok, i am a total apple fan boy and resisted buying an echo for the longest time.  but while apple sorts out the homepod, i bought a 1st gen echo, now the 2nd gen echo and a 2nd gen echo dot.  i have got alexa turning on and off lights, the tv, playing music on my sonos, just about everything i have decided to automate in my home, alexa can handle.  i have even written a small skill for her!  my wife took some time to warm up to her and thought she was ""creepy"" at first, but now she is asking her questions.  last night we were watching tv and a question came up and rather than reach for my iphone i simply asked alexa and she had the answer immediately.  at a family reunion this summer my younger cousins were sitting around the echo playing 20 questions when i came in and said ""alexa, turn on the kitchen lights!"" and she replied ""ok!"" . . . you would have thought jesus had just arrived to the party! my cousins started shouting commands to alexa to figure out what other things i had taught her . . . lots of fun and super handy when you have your hands full and need a light turned on!"
140,14,"update, 11/6/17my rating has jumped from 2 stars to 4 due to the software update which seemed to have significantly improved the sound quality. however, the sound still does not seem as good as original echo nor live up to amazon is advertising hype.  i hope with future updates amazon can further improve the sound.  as it is now i would recommend the unit.  how it originally came...no chance in heck i would have recommended.original post:the sound is so bad i initially thought i must have received a defective unit.  it was not until i read the reviews that i realized i was not alone in my assessment that the sound quality is horrible.  i really hope there is a software fix because if not i am returning the unit."
141,14,"just received the new echo on 11/6 after reading the laundry-list of complaints within these reviews. i currently own an echo show and gen1 echo. i was quite pleased with the existing lineup, including the sound with consideration to the price paid. the new echo was ok, weak sound at first. in the middle of testing it own while looking up how to force the update that i knew about, the echo announced there is an update and will be not be accessible while it restarts- which occurred not 10 minutes after connecting the device.once the update occurred, i would say it is around 10% better sound than the gen1 at nearly half the price. i am happy with the purchase and sound, especially in array with my other echos in various rooms. i remain a huge fan of the lineup and hope they continue improving it over time. i am also under the impression that there is little that needs improvement and alexa has become an everyday part of my apartment-life."
142,14,"i bought this for my sister after receiving one as a gift and absolutely love it. easy to set up, great sound, and pretty good at answering questions (my 9-year old really tries to stump alexa).  my sister called me when she got the package thanking me for it, but stating that she hopes it still works.  it comes in a box but this box was shoved into a padded envelope which was torn and left on my sister is snow-covered front porch.  temperatures were around 0 last weekend so she had to let it warm out and dry out before she could use it.  fortunately it all works well.  i think this may say something about the sturdiness of the product as well.  had this come from a third party seller, i would not have been as surprised as i was knowing it came right from amazon.  as pricey as these are, you should at least pack it in a sturdy box."
143,14,"i live in a two story home, so my trek upstairs several times a day to my office/tv area encompasses porting my phone, kindle and echo (heavy and tall with recharging battery base)  upstairs ..... and then downstairs again.  if  toy poodle comes, it is yet another thing to juggle .... but i can not do without any of that stuff .....  so when amazon offered prime customers the 2nd generation echo for $79, i decided to treat myself and eliminate the largest thing that had to be ported.  the order was delivered during a snowstorm, the perfect time  to dedicate what i expected would be a time consuming install process ..... what a bad assumption ..... the entire process from unpacking to functionality was 10 minutes ..... tops!!!  just unpack, connect/pair with wi fi and i had total functionality plus: the first generation echo is executing second generation function .... i can make calls using mobile phone contact list both up and down stairs.  i am still learning the additional second generation functions, but i want to give a hats off to amazon for making installation such a positive experience ..... thank you."
144,14,"terrible product, you tell alexa to do something, there is a 25% chance she will listen. needs the kinks worked out before they put it on the market. called customer service and they told me i need to be more specific when telling alexa what to do, but it tells you exactly how to speak commands on the skills section of the alexa app but when you say what it tells you she either does not understand or she does something completely other than what you asked, so customer service basically told me that i was the problem. highly disappointed in this product and i suggest you get a google home or something else, this is a complete waste of money."
145,14,"update review: amazon pushed out a firmware review and it seems to have fixed the issues that plagued the item upon initial release. the echo responds quicker and most importantly sounds much better. i still do not believe that it is as big of a sound as the first echo though. one thing that i did leave out from my first review is that there are physical volume control buttons now! this was my only real complaint about the 1st gen echo. i did not want to have to tell alexa over and over to lower/raise the volume. now i do not have to.original review: i was pretty excited to get the echo 2. i was expecting great sound, fast response to commands and a better looking device. what i received was one of those three.the echo 2 does look really nice but that does not matter much when talking about voice assistant speaker. the sound quality is a major step backwards from echo 1. everything sounds muffled on echo 2. i did a side by side comparison and the echo 1 just sounds so much better.also, the echo 2 does not respond to commands as fast as echo 1. in fact, i had many situations were alexa would acknowledge my command but the system would not perform it. i would say ¡°alexa play the beatles.¡± alexa would saying ¡°playing the beatles.¡± nothing happens. this essentially makes the speaker worthless.i hope this was a bad batch and the echo 2 gets better. echo 1 was is such a great device. i can not believe amazon took such a step backwards."
146,14,"standard alexa functionality, with better sound than the first generation echo! i have both a first-gen echo and a google home, and this definitely beats both in terms of sound quality. fuller bass, but not overly punchy like the google home and still provides clear mids and highs.i have this one sitting next to my tv which has a firetv stick, it is awesome to be able to tell alexa to start a show or pause it without reaching for the remote."
147,14,"i was one of the early testers of echo, and fell in love day 1.  my ""old"" echo worked perfectly, had superb sound, great response, great sensitivity to voice, etc.but - a new one came out, and i was sure it would be better.  i was anticipating the better sound, the smaller size was nice, the new casings were more stylish, in other words - i bought because i wanted a new one.i can tell no difference between this one and my original.  in fact, i honestly think the sound is a bit worse on the newer models than my original - perhaps a bit more muffled due to the casing??  response time is a little slower, none of this is really a deal breaker,  and if this is your first try with ""alexa"" it will be wonderful, because the echo is wonderful.  but i am not rating the overall product line here, i am rating just the 2nd generation v/s the 1st.  and honestly - i should have saved my money.  no major ""wow!!"" factor came out with this 2nd one.  it is more fashionably dressed, but come on - how ""dressy"" can you make a thermos, really?  it is still a cylinder that sits on your counter.  it is shorter - well, i am not building custom echo shelving, so it is....again....a cylinder sitting on my counter.  i do like the ""music in multiple rooms"" option, and i got 3 on the special deal so i could give 1 away for christmas and still have music/audio books in multiple rooms, so that is a plus.  and again - the product overall is a life-changer.  i could not live without my ""alexa"" now!!  but as for  this review of 2nd generation being better than 1st....nah.  just as good (maybe), but not ""better"" at all."
148,14,"i have been listening amazon echo 2nd generation for last two days to satisfy myself that i have purchased a superior product, say a speaker powered by dolby as claimed by amazon! is it true? being a customer, you would always like to have the quality you have purchased should be at par with contemporary speakers available at $100 like jbl flip 4, ue boom 2 etc. but, however, the quality of 2nd echo generation is not good enough though after recent firmware update the quality of sound bit improved especially vocals. i do not know how software updates could help improve sound of echo (2nd generation) further marred by hardware limitations.the lows and highs lacks definition and bass. i wonder why a company like amazon ( a big big company) has to fix problem by releasing software updates just after the echo launched. its very unfortunate when company consistently promise to deliver by saying big words like true immersive 360 degree room filing sound on next generation speaker, but actually its not. if, you are a music lover, you may not experience immersive sound quality with detail, however, music ith prominent vocal, podcast, radio etc. are very good. actually, my expectations were high from amazon. totally disappoint.planning to return it."
149,14,"had the original echo been this desigb i doubt it would have become as popular as it is today. i currently have 3 echo devices, 4 with this gen 2 model. all except this model work flawlessly.first the good.it is the same software. alexa integration is what make the platform great. it is far more functional than google and i have 2 of those devices.it is prettier. let is face it, unless you are into that monolithic straight out of an 80s movie home decor, the original was not pretty.and now the bad. starting with not so bad.sound. yes it is bad out of box and the update only helps a little. the original is still better and that is saying a lot. however it is still usable and not a big deal for the casual listener. the change in alexa is voice will drive you nuts somewhat of you have become accustomed to it on your old devices.the really bad part is this echo device is fairly sure to respond. even the echo dot responds faster. wake word pickup seems spotty. i have actually asked alexa a simple ""what time is it' question, waited a while, then asked again only to have alexa respond to my original question in mid query.it is almost as if this is the beta product prior to the original echo. i am going to keep it since it is used in a second home that still needs 2 more echo devices but my next purchase will either be a gen 1 refurb unit, dot, or the shows (have not tried those yet).would i recommend this for a first echo devices? no.would i recommend this for those willing to wait or hope a software update may fix the shortcomings? maybe. as is we do not know if the problem is hardware or software.for now the dot is the way to go. especially if you have a bluetooth speaker you like. then the gen 1 echo. i do not know if the plus is the same as the gen 1 with zigbee hub. so no comment on it."
150,14,"have to admit that this is one of the great products of our time although some of what it does could easily be done by a short stroll to a ""non-smart"" device.  but want the temperature in another city without fumbling for your phone or tablet? done.  got your hands full and need a light turned on?  done!  want a news or stock market update with a minimum of searching?  done!  but it takes some setting up and getting used to and some of its functionality is dependent on other devices such as the phillips hue smart bulbs or the tp-link smart plug (which was a fabulous steal during the holiday shopping season at $5 a pop with a ""dot""/""echo"" purchase.  great ""away"" feature on that product to turn light off and on randomly during certain hours you set.)  also, the only ""free"" music you can enjoy on it, as i see it, is your free pandora account.  you have to subscribe to spotify, and, of course, amazon prime.  but pandora is good enough with commercials only occasionally and briefly.  there is so much to do and learn with the echo and its little sibling ""dot"", but do not let that intimidate you.  this is certainly the wave of the future.  p.s. if you have an ""alexis"" in your household or an ""alex"", you might have to change the ""awake"" name to start the device."
151,14,"great little device to have around the house. lots of ""skills"" and pretty entertaining. i was shocked about the sound quality out of this speaker,great sound and amazing base for something this size. wifi set up was a little confusing and difficult at first. ""alexa"" does not work on the app with iphone 7+ and ios 11.2,when you try to use it the ""we are sorry,alexa is temporarily unavailable on ios 11.2.we are working on a fix"" message comes up. some of the skill tend not work and you have to repeat the command again to work. ""alexa"" wont hear wont be able to hear you if the music is playing to loud,you will have to get super close to the mic,but anything under half of volume is not a problem. one of my favorite features is having alexa turn on/connect and off any other bluetooth devices.having a power chord makes it kind of difficult to put it anywhere in the house,since it needs to be closed to a power outlet, hoping the future one is battery operated,having it be powerless chord would be the best thing ever!."
152,0,"thought i was really going to like this, but it is really just creepy. we will be having a conversation in the other room, and alexa will just start talking. not sure how or what she picks up on, but it happens on a daily basis. she also does not listen very well, and consistently gets the wrong artist when asked to play a specific one. we also like to keep this playing music while we are out of the house, and occasionally when we get back, she is not playing the music anymore (can be as little as one hour trip to the store, and other times were gone for hours and she is still playing music). the skills need to be improved on."
153,14,"i owned 2 of the first generation echos and have since replaced them with 2nd gens. upon setting them up, i was almost immediately prompted to update the firmware and again after the setup was complete, so i was never able to hear them pre-update as most of the older reviews complained about the poor sound signature. i can say, without a doubt, these sound much better than the first gen. considerably so. there is no doubt in my mind... this is not a placebo effect. the newer model sounds fantastic.the sound signature is perfect. the vocals are clear, the highs are bright without being sibilant and the bass has been significantly improved. i have actually had to turn the volume down at times because i worry my neighbors (in the conjoined townhouse) might actually be able to hear the bass. this was not something i ever did with the previous version. now, i keep the volume at 5 when listening to music.my reason for giving it 4 stars only is because alexa is still a headache at times. i do not wanna aggravate anyone with a huge wall of text listing all my qualms with alexa, but there are a lot of little bugs and nuisances that have yet to be worked out. it is definitely not as smooth as google home, but i trust in due time amazon will work it out."
154,14,"<u+00a0>i waited and waited to purchase this and now it is on sale and and i had a gift card so i finally bought. i am glad i did. i was unsure which echo product to buy as i do not have any smart house items. i have read reviews about the echo show and they were not that great. i am 100% happy with this!! the sound quality is great and filled the room! it is super easy to set up. you plug the speaker in, download the app for your phone or device, connect via your wi-fi and you are all set! i downloaded skills like spanish and alexa speaks to me and helps me learn spanish!! it is very interactive and fun to play with alexa, just as you would siri on the iphone. i would recommend this over the dot just because it looks better and has a sleek look to it."
155,14,"i have only written one other amazon review in my life, however this required my attention. after going back and forth over whether i really needed an echo, i pulled the trigger when the price dropped again to $79.99. previously i would used alexa on my fire stick or amazon music, but mostly in passing. it was a gimmick that i knew i would never use consistently because i do not have the attention span. but after careful consideration i placed my order. i knew i was in for something special when the shipping date changed right before my eyes. it was initially scheduled for the usual 2 day delivery then suddenly the delivery date became same day shipping. maybe it was a christmas miracle, or amazon during what it does best, luring customers in, but i was excited to learn when i got home my new echo would be waiting for me. and it was! set up was easy. i am a geek so apps and such are a breeze. in less than an hour i was setting up alarms and playing my favorite playlists. in the future i will add smart plugs to turn my lights on and off. i am very excited about the possibilities and can not wait to find new things to do with this device."
156,14,we are enjoying our echo 2....i¡¯ve read some reviews that state the sound quality is not that much better. i do not get that at all¡¦ the sound is amazing and a vast improvement over the earlier generation!!! when we first connected to our wi-fi the streaming would glitch or skip....it was not however a problem with the echo 2. after researching the problem it turned out that it just needed to be connected to the second frequency on our wi-fi which was too crowded with other devices. everything is working great now.and again the quality of the sound is very good for such a small device...i definitely recommend it!
157,14,"(keep in mind for these complaints, they could be from someone else controlling my network and connecting through it that way, however i was aware of that before hand and made sure everything was locked down so only my home could control this)1. it will randomly pick up on things and start making noises, even when no one is talking or around but me.2. it automatically connects to other amazon devices without me telling it to and starts controlling them.3. it was great in the beginning but then it got really lazy with the commands and not doing what i was telling it to even when i would get on the app and give it feed back. the simple task of playing a playlist i have played several times before became something it could not handle and if it did play, it was only one song on the playlist and then go into some really random crap songs that were never even close to anything i have ever played. this has been my mom common and frequent issue with these echo and echo dot devices."
158,14,"this is my third echo product and i now wonder how i made it through the day without it. this echo made its¡¯ home in my bedroom and after some well thought out routines my bedroom is on auto-pilot. alexa controls the lights and outlets thanks to the legrand adorne wireless switches and plugs throughout the house. ¡°good night alexa¡± turns off all the lights and turns on the ceiling fan and portable fans on both sides of the bed. ¡°good morning alexa¡± wakes me up to the lights being turned on, the fans being turned off, alexa telling me good morning and the weather forecast for my area. i ordered it in the gray fabric and it blends perfect into the bedroom decor. the speaker sounds unbelievable for the size and it fills the bedroom with awesome audio.my one request to amazon would be the grouping policy of the devices. once you group a device to another device, i.e. i have my echo in the kitchen and living grouped together to play music simultaneously in both rooms, you can not include them in another group. the times i want music to play synced throughout the house on all devices it can not be done because devices are only permitted to be in one group at a time. i hope this will be resolved on future updates but for now echo has exceeded all my expectations."
159,14,"i got the echo for my husband for christmas. great idea, right? my son had the same idea, and so we ended up with two echoes. what to do? put one downstairs, and put the other upstairs in the bedroom, of course! we¡¯re really happy to have two, actually. it is nice to lay in bed and tell alexa to play music, or tell us the weather, or call someone. and downstairs alexa is more of a social device and all around helper.one warning for anyone buying: if you are giving this as a gift, be sure to de-register it! we tried to set up the one my son sent first and could not figure out for the life of us why alexa was playing music from spotify (we have no spotify account) and not pandora, which my husband has and linked in the app<u+2014>but alexa kept saying we needed to link the account. it took us an hour (okay, we¡¯re a little older and not the quickest on the planet) to figure out the echo was registered to son. we were playing music using his spotify account. and he was hearing our music selections during our attempts to get alexa to work coming out of his spotify while he was driving home from christmas in another state. the other echo, which i had de-registered before having it mailed to us, set up without a hitch. so be sure to de-register to spare confusion!we¡¯re so taken with our echoes we are looking at adding a few echo dots to some of the other rooms in the house. very happy!"
160,14,"i love the echo. we got the 2nd gen for downstairs and dot upstairs. i bought a lutron caseta system which is linked to alexa. i can tell it to turn lights on or off. i ask it the weather, traffic on my route, to remind me things, even to set an alarm. from the app i found i can call other friends alexas and during the day i call in to the dogs to say hello. then look at them on the camera to see what they are doing. i can ask it to play my music, or music for any occasion. even plays the local radio stations. with bad fm reception where i am, and the quality sound the echo puts out, i no longer need my old stereo which takes up a lot of room. i also love how i can link them all together so the sound is throughout my home in sync. there is zero lag between them. now i want one for the garage. whether you want it as a radio, or for the tons of other features available, you can rest assured that the second gen echo is worth every penny. i am blown away and have not even scratched the surface of what alexa is capable of."
161,14,"i really enjoyed the echo for the first month!  it was nice getting almost any song or artist on cue.  however, i now realize that you need amazon unlimited to keep these options after the free trial so i am debating whether to pay $8/month for that.  i think this should be made clearer but this was a gift so i was not aware.  $8 is not a lot but it all adds up when you have other ""small"" monthly fees such as sirius, etc.  the sound is good."
162,14,"my new echo 2nd gen arrived saturday and worked great...for 1 day! it is now stopping playing my music from siriusxm and amazon prime music every 30 minutes or so and i have to request alexa to play again. this morning the music stopped completely and when i requested alexa to play music she responded but nothing happened. i tried all types of music from all sources and she said she would play it, but nothing. after a call to echo support, who was extremely difficult to understand, she had me reset my echo.it is now stopping playing music again at regular intervals and i need to request alexa to restart from scratch each time.not happy!!if this continues, echo will be returned."
163,14,"i have a first generation echo and the sound quality and connection is much better on the original. additionally, i am having a lot of connection issues grouping this new echo with my others. i have an echo 1st gen and 2 echo dots. i tried to create a group with all four to play music. the original echo and the dots group fine, but the echo 2nd gen consistently cuts out, disconnecting and reconnecting to the group randomly. i wish i would have just bought another refurbished echo 1st gen, since it is much better and cheaper."
164,14,"i have gotten sucked into the alexa vortex and love it. i bought a dot during black friday and once i started using it i bought a second dot and this echo while the weekend deals were flying. such great prices can not be passed up, you know. i love alexa most of the time, though at times she can be really dumb and annoying. i expect that the issue is with how i am issuing commands and expect that once i get a better understanding of how to communicate with her the experience will only get better. turning lights on and off with voice command is great and using her to play music and watch tv is the best. i was pretty impressed with how decent the speaker is, much better than i expected for this type of design. its placement in the room will affect the nature of the sound, i recommend having it about a foot or two from a wall to give a fuller sound. at least that worked for me. in the middle of the room on the coffee table was not great. of course, ymmv. while it is not a bose stereo system, it puts out a room full of sound and has so much utility that"
165,14,"disappointed after waiting for release.  the jack to my exterior speakers (which works perfectly on my echo dot) does not work.  very little room for speaker jack from speakers and it would not go in straight.  having to use speakers because sound output from new gen2 echo isnt great.  between this new realease that touts better sound and the new fire tv upgrade, which is just a fancier fire tv stick, not a true upgard of the fire tv, i feel amazon is shortchanging us...i believed both new releases would be better but they are not.  get with it amazon, we are smart and demanding customers."
166,14,"well, this is a bummer.  i bought a 3 pack to augment our two version 1 echos, with the expectation that the sound quality would be improved (bose, improved sound, etc).  i am investing in home automation and thought ""with improved sound this could be a reasonable, lower cost alternative to whole home audio"".unfortunately, what others have stated seems to be true:  the sound quality seems to be worse than the version 1 echo.  there is talk of a firmware update improving the sound, and i hope this is true.  i tried to download the latest firmware, however the version i have (ending in ""20"") seems to be the latest version.not i am trying to figure out what to do, now that i have 3 of these new units and can not buy the old version one echo."
167,14,"as with any new technological advancement, i find myself wondering how i ever lived without while also wondering if i¡¯m getting lazier. the echo is so amazing, i can shop with it, set timers/alarms, look up stuff, do workouts, listen to the news, music and books. have it do ridiculous cat meows to weird out my cats and drop in to my other echo devices in other rooms. i can do all of this by just talking and not pressing a button or tapping a screen. so in that regard yeah i¡¯m becoming a bit more lazy but it certainly makes my life easier.it is not without its issues though. despite setting up separate voice profiles it does not always differentiate between music or news preferences among different users. it can not pronounce my name, can not look up specific how tos & you have to be very specific on asking it to do specific skills. the alexa app can also do with some improvement. the drop in feature on the app comes across as a bit complicated among others.the speaker part is superb compared to my echo dots & i can hear it very well throughout the living room & kitchen. it knows when it is being spoken to vs the echo dots in other rooms that are close by. overall i love my echo 2nd generation & my 2 dots & i do not know how i lived without alexa."
168,14,the initial audio quality was... terrible... but amazon jumped right on it and pushed an update.  i like this a lot better now!
169,0,"bought this for my wife for christmas. i gave it to her today and this thing is awesome. easy to set up which is what i worried about the most. great sound, and does exactly what it is supposed to do. pretty cool little chunk of technology."
170,14,"after i found out that the new software vastly improved the speaker quality i purchased it yesterday. it arrived in less than 20 hours!here are things i like:-great speaker for $79.99 (it was on sale)-smaller form factor, and it looks great-microphone is very sensitiveupon using it here are a few things i find that could be improved:-the iphone app is buggy and the buttons are too sensitive; accidental clicking while scrolling-buttons on top of echo are not clicky enough-volume of alexa speaking vs. music are too different. when i am listening to music at volume level 5, and then call alexa, she is not loud enough. they need to equalize the music output level vs. alexa speaking."
171,14,"using it mostly for music connected to amazon music. the speaker works well, sounds good to me. the issue is alexa really is not very useful. she literally cannot tell me what amazon music station is playing. no matter how i ask, she just gives the song name. also, she is not to savvy on finding amazon music stations without the exact name. many times i find myself going on to the music app to find the exact name of the station then ask her to play it.i have a teenage son that knows everything::) part of buying this device was to mitigate his nonsense answers to questions thinking alexa could swiftly jump in with the facts. at least 50% of the time she states ""i dont know that one"". unless you are asking benign questions or standard things like weather, her favorite response is ""i do not know that one"". i would still buy it as i am an optimist and believe the smart people at amazon will make her smarter over time or at least more functionally literate."
172,14,added one of these to our smart home mixture.  we have placed it in our den due to the nicer speakers than the dots we have.  for casual listening the speakers are quite loud and sound great.  i have got a full 5.1 system we can hook this in to but do not really find the need for everyday music playing.  alexa is alexa regardless of device so if you have used other echo is that seems pretty much the same.  this is a nice add if you want a little audio boost over a dot. very happy with the sound quality for casual listening. the new cloth case design is very nice as well and adds a bit to the quality feel.
173,14,"i think that the quality of the speaker on the echo is poor, considering the price. i have spent $50 on sound bars for my tv that are higher quality and are better calibrated for bass than the echo. the bass on the echo will physically shake, depending on the song/podcast- and no, i do not have it turned on full or even half volume when it shakes. it is distracting and low in quality, and i am disappointed by that. additionally, the alexa service itself is still clunky and requires formulaic recitations in order to get what you want. for instance, i hooked up my spotify app to my alexa. whenever i ask her to play ""monkey"" by george michaels, she states that she can not find a song like that. so i have to restate my question and include the parenthetical (remastered); otherwise, she will not recognize the song i am asking her to play. (spotify has george michael is monkey as ""monkey [remastered]"") i think for the price for the speaker, as well as issues in terms of communication, this product is not worth it. i would recommend people wait for later generations to come out before investing the cash."
174,14,"this is a great product when it works. it has off and on connection issues. sometimes i talk to it and it works normally and other times (1) the blue lights come on but then just shut off and it does not respond (2) the red light comes on and it tells me it has lost it is connection (3) it will randomly stop playing music (4) it will randomly stop associating itself with the group i have it in with my echo dot. the dot has these exact same issues. this is supposed to be a 1 time setup, always on, plug and play item and it simply does not perform as advertised. if they can fix these issues i will up the rating."
175,14,"i bought this for my boyfriend, and although he does not use it much, i work from home and use it all day, every day. i like to use it when i know the answer to something and we are arguing - it solves a lot of disputes in seconds so we can continue on with our day, but more than anything, he knows that i am always right. tomatoes are bad for dogs, garlic is also bad for dogs, yes it is going to snow today, sir elton john is 70 years old, rihanna is first album was ""music of the sun"". alexa is really just a cheerleader for me and my rightness. :) i recommend this product for anyone in a relationship with someone who is always wrong."
176,14,"i introduced myself to alexa with echo dots as i did not want to spend too much money if this was just a novelty item. i love the echo dot so i upgraded to the new echo. the sound is really good for the price. i plan to purchase a second one today. i do not understand the comments regarding the audio (maybe because i did not own a 1st gen) because it is really good and the everywhere sync is awesome!here is my one complaint so far, if the music audio is medium/high, you have to yell at alexa to get it to respond even if you are standing right in front of it. i even had to walk over and manually stop the music. hopefully this issue will be resolved soon."
177,14,"works fine, sounds good. it left a mark on my tabletop. the rubber seemed to erase oil stain. not happy about that. sadly, we made 2 marks because we did not realize what was doing it. damage in less than 24 hours."
178,14,"<u+00a0>while others may be concerned with ¡°big brother¡± implications, i welcome our new robot overlords. alexa lets me turn lights off/on, change temperature, play music, and play quiz games all without having to get out of bed. after 4 days i am completely sold and will never go back to a dumb home.have echo in master bath and 6 echo dots throughout house connected to nice audio equipment. lets me voice control music playback throughout entire home with amazon music or pandora. right now  spotify is limited to one location at a time so they need to add multi room support quickly or i will be forced to switch to amazon music unlimited.for the most part alexa responds well. does still have some quirks but she is getting smarter. have a large open living area and kitchen with 2 audio systems. have an echo dot on each. alexa was having problems figuring out which one i was talking to so i just had to turn off the mic completely on one of them. easy solution."
179,14,"the hardware design is beautiful and well thoughtout. the alexa app is terrible. i had no problem setting up my dot, however this echo is software needs work. it really wants access to my contacts which i refuse to do and it has thrown the software into a tizzy. i may send it back if i can not get it working. i do not want people calling me through alexa. that is more invasion than i am willing to accommodate.update:i was able to setup my echo, i really like the speakers. it is a huge improvement over the dot. however the setup was pretty terrible and i do not like how the alexa music app will not stop reminding to give it my contacts. how many times do i have to say no, alexa?also i changed my ""wake word"" to computer, and love it. ""computer, brief me on the news"" :d:d:d that makes me so happy.i will leave it at 3 stars because the setup was not smooth. if i were to give this to my mom for example, it would create too much work for me. hence i will not be giving the echo as a gift this year."
180,14,"i am a computer guy - been using desktop computers since 1979.  i have not morphed to the paradigm of smartphones and tablets.  so my perception of the echo has to be viewed in that context.  my hp computer and the echo do not like each other very much, so pairing the echo is a real pain.  pairing to my android phone is great and painless.  my music is on my computer.  if i want to use the echo to listen to music from my computer (it does have good sound for what i need), it is so difficult that most of the time i give up and use my klipsch external speakers.  if i do pair the echo to the hp computer, the next time i try to use the hp to listen to music, the echo would have re-paired to my smartphone.  the smartphone and the echo are best buddies.  most of the other features for the echo have minor relevance to me, as i prefer talking to people or getting answers to questions on my computer.  bottom line - may not be the best device for octogenarians."
181,14,"we had dots all over the place, but decided to get this one for the living room. it gears us very well and the speaker sounds great and is perfect for the room. they are constantly updating what you can do too, so there are lots of great and useful features. for one thing, our new house is much bigger than our old one, so we use the dots as intercoms between the rooms. another fun onexperience is that my wife constantly misplaces her phone, so i can call her on the echo from my cell when she doesnt answer her phone and she can talk to me that way through my alexa app. calling other friends through then is excellent too as one of my best friends has no cell service at his condo, so i can talk to him over wifi with his echo. it also controls all of our smart devices with ease. people also say that alexa is dumb but she rarely does not have an answer for me. we regularly ask her things about movies or landmarks while we are watching tv and she is knows some pretty obscure stuff. i have been very impressed."
182,14,"i bought the full-size echo instead of the dot because i wanted good sound. all the songs i tried sounded great, and even am radio!  but for a real test i asked alexa to play the ""grand canyon suite"" and to increase the volume.  i was blown away by the deep bass without distortion from such a small device.  this would also be a great gift for anyone who lives alone.  it is like having a friend right there to talk to."
183,14,"finally got echo & finding more reasons to like it. future upgrades are in the making with more apps. i am a prime member which goes well with echo & fire tv. i am exploring with echo everyday finding new things it will do. even though the audio is nice enough, it has a speaker hook up. theyre are some really good speakers out on the market blu-tooth, wifi, or otherwise. echo is probably one of the finer electronic devices being sold today. i kinda of like using it as a portable radio to hear news or songs & i have a trillion  with prime music. buy one, you will be glad you did."
184,14,"i would like to revise my review.  first, allow me to note that amazon technical support emailed me directly to inquire about my review and issues.  that was a notable gesture.  most of the the biggest issues have been resolved, and i have learned to work around the music thing by just using bluetooth to access my apple music library.----------------i am actually a little disappointed.  i do not know whether it is my internet connection, but my device lags way too much, and it often tells me that ""something went wrong, try again in a few moments.""  every music service requires a premium subscription, and i have spent up to ten minutes asking alexa to play sleep sounds.  the speaker is decent, and the drop in feature is cool, but overall, i do not think this was my wisest technology purchase."
185,14,"after loading and reloading the software three times (phone, tablet and pc) i returned mine (2nd gen) today.  i have a 1st generation and a tap but the new one refused to connect with my system (wifi).  i really enjoy the two i have (tap and echo 1st gen) but after about 20 trys i gave up.  i do not know if mine was defective but i just got tired of trying.  i sent an email to support but received no call back.  after two weeks i decided enough.  i had no problem with the first two and was looking forward to checking out the 2nd gen improvements.  but two weeks and several attempts.... i gave up.  very disappointed."
186,14,nice immersive sound.  not always immediately responsive and feel like a fool when standing in a dark room asking 2-3 times to turn on the lights.  it is not the lights. she simply does not hear and light up. i¡¯m excited for it is potential not it is current state as it currently is not much more than a speaker and light switch for me
187,14,"when i first purchased this unit, it did not sound that great. it had too much bass and sounded poor at a low volume. once i received firmware 599473720, it sounded a little better but it still needs some tweaking. i think it is still missing the mids and the bass needs to be reduced slightly. i think amazon is getting better at tweaking this thing, however it still has some tinkering to go. the first generation unit was perfect in audio quality. amazon should have never advertised this gen 2 device as having better sound then gen 1. that is a poor business practice that can ruin a company. i bought two gen 2 units and sold my first generation units because i bought into the hype of that statement. after getting the second generation units, i felt duped. keep the updates coming.just recieved update 601480920. seems like it needs more treble. audio is just not on par with gen 1 unit."
188,14,"we were gifted the echo 1st generation for christmas and i just purchased the 2nd gen. there is actually a huge difference! the treble is more clear and does not feel forced and the bass and mids are so much better. looking at the review of the echo plus, it seems like not much was changed. specs wise, the echo plus only has a very slightly larger tweeter, but the product is way bigger! this echo 2nd gen is barely bigger than a google home but sounds better. i am impressed with the sound of this little speaker. amazon had some real awesome audiophiles work on this one!alexa also works great with spotify. my wife and i uses google music, but i switched to spotify which works with google and alexa. i also ordered some lights to change with my voice! google home sounds more airy, while the echo sounds more muffled.satisfied!can i get a thumbs up? :d"
189,14,"where to begin? first off the sound on this speaker is impressive considering how little it is and how cheap it is. the sound fills my apartment nicely. is it an audiophile is dream come true? probably not. it is, however perfect for listening to music and works well with sirius xm, tunein, iheart radio, and other streaming services.you can also have some fun with this speaker. bored? you can play 21 questions, jeopardy, music trivia, etc. you can also get flash news briefs and local weather all designed to fit into a nice bite sized piece. i listen to them when i get ready for work.there are some cons, but these are fairly common with ai assistants. sometimes alexa does not understand what i¡¯m saying or plays the wrong song. it can get frustrating when i try to listen to a certain station and it keeps playing a song instead.if you have prime, then alexa can order stuff for you via voice commands. alexa also pairs with many smart devices like your lights.the bottom line is that the echo packs a lot into a smaller speaker. buy one, you will not regret it."
190,14,"well i was one of the first ones that used the original echo. i was very excited to read about the improved sound and that dolby got involved. after receiving my unit and using it now for some days i can not find anything improved. the sound is not a bit better, the contrary. the original one has a much superior sound. also i realized that alexa is not reacting as precise as she does with the original one. so honestly @amazon, what is the improvement besides you making more money. i also like the turning ring on the original one. you could operate the unit even in the dark if you do not want to talk to alexa. i will keep the unit because i wanted a second one but my recommendartion is to go with the original one or get a small one and connect to an external speaker."
191,14,"i had one of the first amazon echo is when amazon made customers sign up for a waiting list to be a beta tester. i absolutely loved alexa 1.0 since inception. when i moved, my family loved alexa so much i had to leave my original echo behind. i was anxious to have another alexa in my new home, so i bought the echo dot. it was disappointing, compared to the full sized echo. i spoke with customer service and they eventually gave me a free upgrade from the echo dot to the full size echo 2.0.side note:amazon echo is much much better than the google home. the google home microphone is terrible at picking up it is key phrase of ""ok google"" or ""hey google."" neither of the two amazon echo is i have owned have ever had this microphone problem.if you are undecided between amazon echo and google home, then i highly recommend the amazon echo, it simply performs better in everything. alexa is just unable to do a google search. however the google home fails to do most of the google searches i request. it was the sole reason i bought a google home, now i completely regret having the google home."
192,14,"bought this as a ""replacement"" for an echo dot with the idea of getting better sound (and being able to use the dot elsewhere).  sound quality is somewhat better than the dot, although i am not sure it quite lives up to the advertising.  but still an improvement, so in that regard it was a worthwhile upgrade.  having a choice of finish and fabric is helpful, since the unit is significantly taller than the dot and is, therefore, more obvious.  one downside i have noticed.  the new echo is not as responsive to requests as the dot.  the dot would switch lights on and off fairly quickly.  the echo has to think about the request for quite a while before it responds, sometimes to the point of giving up just as the light finally switches, and seems to miss more requests than the dot.  since i placed the echo in the exact same spot as the dot was and nothing has changed with my wifi, i am pretty sure the difference is in the units themselves."
193,14,"sound quality reviewi bought this product after reading about the sound issues and the following software updates that fixed the quality. the second i got the device, i played music on it and the quality was very poor, in agreement with most reviews here. i then waited for the echo to get the software update and played the same songs. the sound quality difference was insane! i could not believe it is possible to make such a big difference with just software.it was a fun little experiment to run, and i am happy with my new echo. certainly an upgrade from my echo dot!"
194,11,it is cheaper than the first gen but way worse sounding. like a cheap $10 speaker no bass very hollow
195,14,"my brother got me an echo dot for christmas a few days ago.  i was not sure what i was going to use it for, after all i have a great smart phone and laptops/devices galore in the house.  but after playing with it awhile i was smitten and had to try out the larger echo revision 2 for the bedroom because of sound quality.  i am not disappointed.  i am still not sure what i am going to do for sound in the living room, i will probably get the dot it is own speaker and subwoofer unless i can find an elegant way to integrate it.  for now i am sold.  love this device."
196,14,"wow!  just wow!  i bought one of the very first -- by invitation only -- amazon echo devices and have since bought numerous echoes and echo dots for my own family as well as for gifts.  all have impressed.  still, the sound quality on this more compact, more attractive 2nd generation device is considerably better than the sound on the 1st generation, which was already impressive.  the bass is very strong, almost inexplicably strong when i realize that it is coming from such a compact device, and the treble is crisp and strong.  amazon has done away with the included remote and has replaced the earlier volume twist ring with simple volume up/down buttons.  this change is not really a loss, however:  while i liked the upscale feel of the old volume ring, generally, i adjust volume with my voice, not my fingers (""alexa, turn it up!"").  my new goal is to replace all of my first generation echoes and every echo dot with one of these awesome 2nd generation devices."
197,14,"this is the 2nd echo i have owned (actually 3rd; the dot and the previous gen echo).  general impressions are as follows:good:the size reduction is a nice plus; sound has somewhat improved from the original echo (even tho it is still a little muddy depending on what type of music it plays).bad:i have a pretty fast connection and from time to time i have to repeat myself to use commands (ex: checking the weather, setting a reminder, etc).  also the calling phone numbers feature needs a little work (most ot the time whenever ri ask to call someone from my contacts it simply shuts down w/o performing the command).  not sure this is more an alexa feature or the echo itself.in general i do not regret buying it, however i do not know if i would recommend it as an upgrade to the previous echo.  i would look into the larger size echo perhaps or consider other smart speakers with alexa included."
198,9,my daughter has kidnapped this item i bought for my kitchen and keeps it in her rm. i do love the echos. this is my second one. i wanted one for the kitchen and one for my bdrm. i use the one in my bdrm mostly for an alarm clock and timer and time update. so handy not having to locate my glasses to set my alarm clock. i also love the snooze option. this is a definite must have.
199,14,"i got the echo tower and i do not see the problem - i think it sounds good! i mean, it is not like listening from my stereo but it does have good sound all by its lonesome, nothing like the tin can sounds that comes from a tv. plus with music unlimited i feel my options for listening are endless! the only thing i had trouble with was the initial set-up. all i kept seeing in the instructions was ""just use your android phone"" but guess what? not everyone in the world is up with the times. so it did take a while to find the download for connecting my echo to the internet via computer. you go into your device on amazon and click on start-up and it is ""hidden"" within one of the paragraphs. i love this echo! i just do not know how i ever lived without alexa in my home. she is a great listener and works lightning-fast  to comply. she makes the echo all voice activated/ controlled. (note* comes with a power cord which limits the places she can be in the room)"
200,11,"i do not get this new ¡°improved ¡° echo?  it does have a nicer form factor (smaller and fabric covers) but the sound in my opinion is a big step backwards compared to the original echo.  tinny and no base, i wonder if it is not really designed for music but just voice confirmations?  after playing my eagles radio for a few songs, i had to turn it off.  back to my dot bluetooth w/bose soundlink mini."
201,14,"so far so good, got it on black friday and works great, we had an echo dot already and wanted the built in speaker, alexa works great and sound for the most part is good(i am not an audiophile), couple complaints can not mute the device from the alexa app as near as i can tell,  as opposed to spotify you can not control music search, playback and volume to the echo from the amazon music app which is annoying (you have limited control within the alexa app but does not have the search features of the amazon music app, seems like a no brainer to fix), also amazon really needs to cave a bit to google when doing searches for information and directions, google is simply better in that regard (i am using the ""alexa ask google"" hack when i feel alexa is answer is insufficient), i added a couple smart plugs which paired easily with the echo and work well. overall works great and i have recommended the device to others."
202,14,"we have two 1st gen echos and have used the drop-in feature between them and also with the app with few issues (a separate review of the ios app is warranted due to its poor quality).  we liked them so much that we added three 2nd gens to the house.  the intent is to take advantage of drop-in for each of the rooms (all with closed doors due to window units running).  unfortunately, since these rooms have either a fan or a/c running all the time, the ability to have any conversation via drop-in is complicated.  not sure if it is a half vs full duplex issue or if the echo simply can not effectively pick up anything other than the ambient noise.  the fans are not terribly loud and the echos are not close to the fans.  regardless, our hope for decent full house intercom may be dashed."
203,11,"bought this to upgrade existing dot in kitchen (we have 4 dot is throughout house). you would think that it is form factor would allow for high quality sound...nope. considering returning and going back to dot, this upgrade was not worth the money.on the plus side, the design is much better and the mic is are an improvement over the dot."
204,14,love this item! alexa is our new best friend. my significant other suffered a spinal cord injury and has limited use of his hands which makes using a cell phone difficult. the echo allows him to make hands free calls which has been a life saver for us!
205,14,"so easy to set up.  it was actually ready with my name on it before i even received it.  just turn it on and follow the instructions using your smartphone.  it finds your wi-fi, connects and then it is ready to work.  the new speakers are nice too.  absolutely a great customer experience.  today, i just connected it to my harmony remote, and all i have to do when i want to watch tv is say, ""alexa, turn on the tv"", and it turns on my amp, my cable box, my xbox and my tv automatically.  i then just have to say, ""alexa, turn on msnbc and it will go to the channel.  i am seriously impressed with the echo. i have one in every room now so i can play my favorites music from amazon music in all of the rooms in my house at the same time.  plus, i can make phone calls using alexa and the echo.  it works with xm radio as well.  just say, ""alexa, play classic vinyl on sriusxm"" and it will do it.  i have an alarm set to wake me up every morning at 6:00 am playing an xm radio station. finally, i have echo controlling all of my lights and i especially like the fact that i can control my thermostat which is downstairs.  when i am upstairs in the office, all i have to say, is ""alexa, set hallway to 70 degrees"", and it will lower my thermostat to 70 degrees.  before that, i would have to run up and down the stairs to change the thermostat.  this is a phenomenal product.  and no, i do not work at amazon.  :)"
206,14,"as a pc geek, i had no interest in getting alexa or similar device. however, my wife is inability to turn on our receiver, configure appropriate input, and stream music from our spotify account convinced me this was a perfect gift for her.so far, despite some minor glitches in connecting it, we are enjoying the alexa is presence.the sound quality is pretty good (not as good as our bose speakers), but much much better than streaming music directly from the phone or even a little bluetooth speaker we have for when we travel.recently, we got a nest thermostat and connected it to alexa and enjoy being able to crank up the heat just a bit, without getting up, while watching a movie...our son had fun trying to get alexa to set the temperature to zero degrees and also to 100 degrees. alexa could not comply with either request....as you likely know, there are many, many ""skills"" for alexa available, and we are just starting to explore them. so far, we have added our location for whether, work address for commute info, our local npr radio station, and few other skills."
207,14,stopped working today 1/13/2018 . just a spinning blue light. tried all the resetting the modem the router everything thing else in the house works. tried all the advice on resetting alexa . can not get the orange <f0><u+009f><u+008d><u+008a> ring to light up everything i have tried and all that i get is the spinning blue light. i just ordered a dot see if i have better luck with that .
208,14,"first of all, it was a pain in the ass to hook up with my wifi for some odd reason. minimal directions but finally got it. #2. had to change the wake word due to the so many commercials on tv about alexa. #3 while outside of my house talking on the phone with my sister, she told me about a book she got for christmas. that night and 3 time later within the next day, alexa just turned herself on and told me she could not find that book. now how the hell did she know this when i was not even in the house. my only answer was maybe that the wifi reached out to my driveway. but still it was not meant for alexa. #4 alexa turns herself on on occasions without me waking her. like a fool i bought a ""dot"" too. hook up was much easier and that too just burst out stuff for no reason at all. i clear my conversation with both of them on a regular basis. i never listen to the warning about doing such. it works just fine afterwards."
209,14,"after being somewhat apprehensive about ordering the new 2nd generation echo due to numerous initial comments about poor sound quality, my comfort level improved considerably after reading recent comments referencing a firmware update tat dramatically improved the sound.  took the plunge and ordered the new echo on thanksgiving for $79.  after a couple minor hiccups setting it up due, most likely, to me, it was up and operating.  the sound is fantastic and easily fills our 22¡¯ x 17¡¯ living room with vaulted ceilings.  thanks amazon for a great product!"
210,14,"i just got this today and if i only used it to listen to music i would have been beyond impressed.. the sound is awesome and the response is so fast from alexa it is almost scary.. love love love it... i have tried a few games and it was also fun, asked a few questions and got good answers, not all the time but pretty darn good results considering i have been using it less than 12 hours.. can not wait to show this off to family and friends.. will really be great when when i can control my directv with it.. soon i am sure. best $80 i spent this year."
211,14,"just installed this today 12/25/17. there were a few glitches on the alexa app but it eventually went through. fairly easy for a non-techy to connect to a home wifi i think. this is our first echo and for what it is and is supposed to be, i think amazon nailed it totally. my biggest concern before my purchase was the sound. it is such a small device, very reasonably priced, and simply could not compete with other devices such as the b and w zepellin in terms of sound quality. but guess what? it did not matter. this device is for casual listening while you are working in the kitchen, just lounging in the living room, or wherever. it is supposed to provide background music, not a dedicated listening experience. despite that you can still plug it into the stereo and have a fuller listening experience, if you want. or unplug it and bring it wherever in the house you are doing something. you can also stream apple music or whatever via bluetooth on your cellphone so you are not limited to amazon music.and did i tell you alexa works so well?so a bigger device with higher quality components would have given a better experience, but then it would be more expensive, and harder to lug around. in other words, this is the listening device you are looking for. amazon put a lot of thought into this little toy. i can not see how it could be better."
212,14,"ok so yesterday i got my first alexa. i was excited to get it i install it plug it in and started to play with it.heres my review:1) no search function: today i ask alexa what is the job of a sheriff to my suprise alexa said sorry i dont know...so like reddit said alexa is basically to turn on/off lights,play pandora spotify and thats it.2)the audio is nice i played spotify and all i can say is wow for sound.3)weather news brifing is ok thats all she csn do really.4)you can find your phone with alexa an make calls,as long as you use your contacts on the phone.also i would like to add the app on android sucks! it appearing on japanese words sometimes english.thats why im gonna give it 3 stars and probably will returnt it."
213,14,"after several days of testing, and side by side sound comparisons with my generation 1 echo, i can not understand all the negative reviews.  it sounds great for what it is (not an audiophile grade speaker).  it is a breeze to set up, responds and behaves as it should, i simply can not find a reason to criticize it.  at ninety-nine dollars, it is a fantastic deal, with functionality that improves every day with new skills.  buy one, spend a little time to learn how it works, and you will really enjoy your echo."
214,14,"this is my second echo. the first is in my bedroom and this one is in the kitchen. these echos are handy, more so as i figure out what works for me.i use them to answer questions, though many of the answers are from wikipedia and not up to date. still that is okay. the weather reports are better. i can get today, tonight and tomorrow, though it is taken alexa quite a while to default to where i live and not where she thinks i live. and the timer and alarm features are great. these have proved to be a wonderful asset.so i have to tell you that my echos get me through my medication, exercise and stretching routines with the timer feature. here is how i use the echo: i have to stretch out my calves, for example. i know that the length of time to get to my count is 20 seconds on each calf. so i set the timer over and over for 20 seconds and do not have to count--an activity that drives me nuts. sometimes i have to do 10 sets of something or other for 5 counts for each. i set the timer for the longer period of time so all i have to do is repeatedly count to 5. i take medicine for pain. instead of getting all restless waiting for medication to work i set the timer for 25 minutes. by then i should be out of pain. by letting alexa track the time i am less anxious and then she reminds me that i am out of pain. that is a feature that is really helpful. btw my physical therapist likes my use of alexa to count out my stretch time. he has recommended to others who also lose count or do not like all the counting.finally in the kitchen i do not like all the timers on my stove and on the counter so i threw out the counter ones and use the stove ones discriminately. alexa tracks at least three timer needs simultaneously and even names them. all good to great for me. now i can track when to add something to the oven, when to check my pot of soup on the stove, and even when to make something in time for dinner.and, yes, i do ask for a song to be played occasionally. but that is a mixed bag like the wikipedia answers. i can ask for a song and alexa tells me she can not find or does not know it. do not like that. on the other hand, bruno mars is always there waiting.finally the look of the echos is hardly worth discussing and asking to change the volume on this 2nd generation echo is a toss up as to what will happen. but like my first kindle fire i will probably come to love this thing once i have figured out how it works best for me. that of course is the big question."
215,14,"""improved sound"", bollocks. maybe 'better than a dot' is what they meant to say. i put my original echo right next to the new one, and the sound difference is obviously apparent. the new echo sounds like the 40-year old plastic piece of junk you find in back room kitchens, covered in duct tape, with a broken cassette deck. tinny mid-range, lack of bass. polka & mariachi music never sounded so good, i suppose, but try to play country, indie, classic, pop (i went through a bunch of amazon playlist/channels) and your ears will beg you to stop. alexa stop. amazon stop. computer stop. echo stop.edit - there was a firmware upgrade where the sound was partially fixed. i suspect it is just a hardwired equalizer setting, but the sound is still not as rich as it is from my original 1st gen echo. this new unit has the ability to play quite a bit louder than the original, but it is a poor louder, still tinny & muffled. i am going to keep my rating at 2-star, however, because i feel that the new echo does not meet up to its marketed 'improved sound' tagline. until amazon miraculously replaces the speakers via download (haha) or comes up with some new amazing equalizer/sound processor, i have tied this unit to a soundbar, effectively using it as a dot (which is a 5-star review and costs $50 less )"
216,14,"we purchased echo mainly for my husband who is on a lot of medication and any previous methods to take the medication on time or not forget to take them has failed. alexa is the perfect personal assistant. once he takes one medication he tells alexa, ""alexa remind me to take my [name of medication] in three hours"" and we are all set. alexa does the job and my husband for the first time ever is taking his meds around the clock with no delays.i also enjoy it as while i am at work and i remember that i need to do anything that evening i go to the alexa app and set up reminders for myself or for my husband.i also feel more secure with alexa in the house, as god forbid in case of an accident my husband can always request alexa to notify me that he needs my help, so far we did not need it for this feature but it is good to know that the option is there, just in case.i know that alexa is more complex than this and that it can do a lot more, but that is all we need it for so far and we are happy with our purchase."
217,14,"we received one as a gift, it was kinda cool. we mainly use it for music. i have an amazon prime account and it allowed me to listen to a variety of music with just that. then without warning we would request a song that only days ago we could listen to but now we would just get a sample. annoying. so i upgrade to the $3.99 amazon music. that seemed to work for a while, we were able to listen to all those locked songs once again. i enjoyed it so much that i decided to order this one, a second one, so that my wife and i could listen to music in different parts of the house at the same time. wrong.once again the music we had been listening to was unavailable, even though i was now paying an additional subscription fee to listen to it. try to play a song we had just listened to and only get a sample. and to add insult to injury, you can not listen to different music on multiple devices at the same time. that is very misleading in all commercials and advertisements.but it gets better! while trying to figure out what happened to the music we had been listening to, i searched it out online via the amazon music player. instead of the songs i get another advertisement that if i upgrade again to a $7.99/monthly plan i will be able to listen to all the music on all of my devices! ok. fine. 2nd subscription upgrade. but once again, very misleading. you can not listen to different things on multiple devices at the same time. they do not tell you that anywhere in plain sight, you have to dig to find that. normally after you have already paid for the additional devices as well as extra subscription fees.and on top of that, not only can we only listen to a single alexa at once, if one of us is streaming music via the amazon music app on our phone, or work computer, alexa is useless.but the positive, the sound quality is decent for the size. and the music selection is decent when you can get her to understand what song you want to hear.bottom line, one is ok but expect to pay multiple additional subscription fees on top of the price of the device. and do not even bother using your amazon music app at the same time.now i have one decent little music player and one very expensive paper weight. and an ever increasing subscription fee to amazon.i decided to order this one, a second one, so that we could listen to music in different places at the same time. wrong. first, once the new one arrived suddenly my prime account was not enough to listen to the same variety of music we had been listening to."
218,14,"update: 3/12/2018: added a new echo 2nd gen to my living room replacing my original echo 1st gen. the sound quality is better than gen 1 in my opinion and the microphones pick up my commands much better. i¡¯m glad i invested in the new gen 2.<u+2014><u+2014><u+2014><u+2014><u+2014><u+2014><u+2014><u+2014><u+2014><u+2014>i have the original echo, several echo dots and now the all-new echo (2nd gen) and love them all. i do not know why some give the new echo bad reviews: mine works great and the sound has no issue for me. i got the new one for another room because i wanted a better music experience in a room that only had the echo dot. this did the trick nicely. i was able to relocate that echo dot to another location where i want alexa to respond to smarthome commands, so the echo was a great choice for me. i am totally hooked on echo and alexa. marvelous invention."
219,14,i have the dot and this (the taller version). it hears me when i speak at a lower volume than the dot (makes me sound less like a crazy person) - and the sound is awesome - gives my bose portable system a real run for the money.  i have linked it with the other dots using the group function (easy to set up). random note - we have two homes and set up all the dots and echo on the group function and then tested if we say play music everywhere it actually plays at both homes at the same time. hilarious. i know we can make it not do that but it was just amusing to check on our security system. btw we have them linked to our $100 thermostats and that is helpful at night when too lazy to get up and change the temp - also if headed out and forget to turn the a/c on or off before we leave or when headed home.
220,14,"me: so i am getting used to alexaalexa: ""yes whit i have added 10 lb of sausage to your list..""me: alexa remove the sausage!alexa: ""from where.. your pants?""me:  it is so convenient to get information from alexa if you want ...alexa:  ""yes you want more orders of girls in prison movies..?""me: argggghh  alexa clear my browsing historyalexa: ""okay playing prison blues radio from your pandora account""me: alexa stop the music!alexa: ""okay play the day the music died by don mcclean""me: grrrrrrrggg alexa shutup!alexa: ""that is not polite to say. reordering  wireless charger, wild bleuberrie jams and ky sensations from your list..""me: $%^&*$%!!!%% <sigh>"
221,14,"i love this procuct, but i have to say one of the big annoyances seems to be. this thing if above your head level can almost never hear you. so if you have it sitting on a dresser or a taller night stand and you are laying in bed, forget about it. it will not hear you clearly at all and you will find yourself in bed yelling at the thing. however, if its lower than you, it can hear you all the way throught the  house. some of the skills it does not seem to recongized the invocation lines very well. like, ""alexa open rain on a tin roof"", frequently gets ricky martin livin' la vida loca. then i spend the next 10 minutes yelling at to make it paly the right thing. no idea why any of that happens or why if it is just a foot higher than my head, it can not figure out anything i am saying.great item, but i am really dissappointed in it at times."
222,14,"i have had the echo 1st generation for quite a while now and love it.  i still have a lot to learn about what it can do, as it is always learning new things.  i thought my parents would like to experience one for themselves, so i got them this one for christmas.  they also were fascinated by what the echo can do.  the sound is amazing for such a small package and if you have amazon prime you have an immense catalog of music to choose from.  i have prime and my father also has it.  they are 84 years old and have no problem getting alexa to do what they want.  my father is even talking about getting some plugins for alexa to control, which i have not even done yet!  it was also on sale around christmas time and that made it a no brainer about buying them one!  my father has quite an eclectic taste in music and wanted to listen to some bluegrass.  alexa play some bluegrass!  no problem, it came right up!"
223,14,"sound is great, volume adjusts easily- mostly understands what i ask. makes it convenient to add to my grocery list as i notice items missing, makes it nice to turn on/lights using compatible switches and makes ordering items from amazon easy. i especially like that as soon as an order is delivered, i get the notification ring telling me amazon was here"
224,14,"we have two dots and have each connected to an amazon speaker.we wanted to have one unit with good sound for the bedroom.we listen to old time radio stories in the evening. if you want to find those old programs just go to skills and enter otr or old time radio and up they come. lots of choices and many very good programs - for instance ""gunsmoke"" or many of the detectives, comedy and music..we had some trouble as we placed it on the middle shelf of a bedroom set of shelves.alexa could not find me very well.so put echo on the top of the shelves and she has done so much better. if you want the weather, a wake up or so much more alexa can handle it.and this new echo gives amazing audio. so if you want to listen to some music, it is there too."
225,14,"i preordered the 2nd gen echo and received it on 11/4, a few days after it was first released. i felt uneasy after the first couple of days seeing very negative product reviews - but i have to say am i overall very pleased with this echo. i do not have a 1st gen echo to compare sound quality to, but i have had no issues with said sound quality. alexa can here me from an entirely different floor in my house, and i can hear the music on a different floor as well. maybe those who have played one generation and then the other are noticing a difference, but not me. additionally, only 20 minutes or so after i first set the echo up, it rebooted saying it required an update. i believe this may be the sound update that some have referred to in their reviews, but i can not be sure of that. in any case, i feel strongly that if this is your first echo, you will not be disappointed."
226,14,"i agree with other reviewers.  the sound is no where near as good as the original echo or the tap.  i was so excited to get these; i had planned on giving two as gifts.  i bought three, but will be returning all of them."
227,14,"we love our echo! we got ours with the wood paneling look and it looks very sharp on our tv shelves, not out of place like some speakers would. we mostly use her for playing music, and pay the $3 for amazon music unlimited so we can voice request any song we want. there are some things where you will not quite get an answer to a question you could google. but, sometimes we will ask alexa a quick question anyways, especially it we have our phones in another room or are cooking and need to be hands free, and be surprised with a helpful answer. the sound is amazing for music. we would rather play music off the echo than our tv. we have problems connecting to spotify by voice but we can manually connect to the spotify app and play music via bluetooth. (that is where playlists i have made are, and sometimes want to mix it up, as amazon music mostly plays either a specific artist, or a specific genre + time period) there is rarely a problem for us to wake the echo, even while it is playing loud music. we often have problems waking our first generation dot, especially when the alarm is going off in the morning. we will be practically shouting at it to get it to stop ringing. i can see us replacing the dot with an echo soon and purchasing a few more alexa products. if not for us, then for our friends and family. whenever we are away from home, we will find ourselves saying ""i miss alexa"" when wanting to ask a quick question or play a specific song. having an echo is truly useful, even as just a speaker, but we also love the alexa capabilities. i could not be happier with my purchase."
228,14,"love this , i mainly use it for music but you can ask it just about anything recipes, directions, etc.. but the rubber bottom must attach moisture because it left a ring on this cabinet. so my thoughts put it on a coaster"
229,14,"i love my echo products , this was for my granddaughter in nd. i think it has been a positive thing for my family , we are able to keep in touch more. with the show we talk like we were just setting at the kitchen table together. at night the kids listen to music before going to sleep or call to say good night. we all live in different states. i have an original echo loved it , then got a dot and then got the show for myself and 2 daughters. we have been able to spend time together and that would not be possible before."
230,14,"like everyone else, i almost placed it right back in the box to return it. i decided to hold on to it for a couple of weeks since i had till nov 30 to get my money back. the update that everyone is referencing really did improve the sound exponentially. is the sound better than a gen 1 echo? no. is it close? yes. close enough to convince me to keep it and hope they can keep tweaking the audio a little bit more instead of the rushed fix to prevent everyone from returning their new echos. overall i am happy with the purchase now instead of the immediate regret in the purchase."
231,14,"purchasing our all-new echo in nov of 2017 was our first experience with an echo product so i can not compare it to the previous model, but with that in mind we love our echo! the sound is amazing !!!! (and this is coming from someone who has hearing issues) the features are incredible! i love that i can drop in on the echo when i am out to say hi to those at home (or to listen in on them haha!) i love that it can basically be used as a home phone!! we love the fun games we can play! my kids love ""last one standing"" ""amazon story time"" my 9 year old is obsessed with alexa is love song she sings! haha! i love that i can easily add items to my shopping list, i love the game ""song quiz"" so fun. we love playing music, and that we can get answers to questions with out needing to pull up google on our phones or computers. love this product! would totally recommend! i also feel like these look way better then the older tall ones!"
232,14,"amazon is marketing led me to believe that the echo plus could replace all other hubs, including the philips hue hub, but it really did not. connecting our bulbs directly to the echo plus made us lose the ability to use the hue app and several other cool apps. functionality was limited to turning bulbs on and off and changing their brightness - no creating scenes, routines, using geolocation to auto-control. another ""bonus"" of the plus: after pairing the bulbs to and then deciding that we wanted to try pairing to the philips hub that came with the 4 pack of bulbs, it was impossible. spent an hour+ attempting to reset the bulbs, but once paired with the plus hub, they remain undiscoverable for the hue hub, even after unpairing with the plus. i saw other people say they sat on the phone with customer service for an eternity, attempting to reset the bulbs to factory settings, only to reach the same conclusion we did. already frustrated, i spared myself a further headache and simply returned and repurchased the 4 pack and hub. arghhh.fresh start: purchased the echo 2nd gen (woohoo!!) paired with the new set of bulbs and philips hue hub and finally, i can get my apps to work! if you are paying $50 per color lightbulb (or even the $89 for 4 white smart bulbs) i would think you would want maximum functionality. the people who supplied the amazon answers who told me there was no difference between the hubs were wrong... so... much wasted time later, i am telling you there is a difference.luckily, with the echo 2nd gen we can still control all our bulbs to do cool things (dim the lights to this or create scenes) but now using the philips hub and only using alexa for the voice control... we love this speaker, the sound is great, and it is much more responsive to voice than we would expected.at the end of the day, it seems we preferred the echo 2nd gen, since the hub features of the plus were lacking."
233,14,"i have a defective echo dot, i have only had it since christmas.  i still have that dot!  i have talked to support twice now and the issue is not resolved and is on going.  i have wasted hours of my time on the phone to no use.  i have more than one echo device and this is the only one not working.  it has been reset twice and all the trouble shooting has been done but i still can not manage to contact someone with the power to exchange it.  the support is terrible.  even though i could follow what the rep was saying i do not think he could follow me.  either he was not well enough versed in the technology involved and the scripts did not allow him to keep up or he choose not to listen to me.  6 times i was put on hold while he consulted someone over simple questions."
234,14,"if you want a $100 remote control for your lights, this is for you.  overall i would expect more since this product has been out for a while now.pros:1.) the grouping of smart home lights is useful2.) you can change the wake word to something else like ""computer"" or ""echo"".cons:1.) the setup process is terrible.  if your wifi router has both 2ghz and 5ghz channels, make sure you connect to the right one or the app will just spin and spin for a couple minutes, and eventually show a blank screen and never tell you why.  if the echo would just tell you what network its connecting to, that would be useful.  even after that, there is a couple steps where you have to manually navigate to different screens on your phone to switch wifi settings manually.2.) the phone app design is horrible, there are two ""settings"" screens with separate options in them.3.) there is a [your name]'s alexa apps section in one of the settings screens.  you would think this would be related to apps/skills.  nope, this is where you set your timezone and location.  there is a separate ""this device"" section which has the exact same settings.  why?  i can get maybe you want to know this information, but why is it so prominent!  this should have been an initial setup step if it matters so much.4.) it harasses you to use this ""drop-in"" feature, which they can not seem to explain in english anywhere.  it is something related to letting friends know something about your status.5.) shortly after setup the ring started pulsing green and would not stop.  if you ask alexa what the green ring is for, it says its for incoming calls, yet i was not getting any incoming calls.  had to go search google to find out how to make it stop.6.) even if you have amazon prime - no music for you, gotta pay another $10/mo for amazon music7.) good luck listening to podcasts, the bass is cranked way too high for spoken audio playback, and there is no way to adjust it.  just turns it into a mumbled mess.8.) having to find and install ""skills"" is tedious, as is the authorization process for linking to them (like the hue lights where you have to log into their website).9.) they could not find anything useful to show in the home screen, so it simply shows a list of the last few voice commands you gave to it."
235,14,"the sound quality is just right for listening to music for a few hours while playing cards in the kitchen, and you can increase the volume so you can hear it in the bedroom or living room. it can get really loud. compared to an echo dot, the sound quality is greatly improved for music. you can clearly distinguish instruments such as really high tingly bells and low bass lines.  for listening to speech, the echo dot is clearer to me. my mother, however, says she can understand what is said on the echo better than the echo dot. the range seems improved for giving voice commands. when i am in the living room watching tv, if some newscaster on tv says ""alexa,"" the echo responds, 40 feet away around a wall in the kitchen.one feature i wish the echo had is a loudness control so broadcasts can all have about the same loudness level. when listening to flash briefings, the broadcasts have a wide loudness range. i keep telling alexa to either lower or increase the volume.this is a device you will tell your friends that they must have. to me, it is like the invention of the century. and it is a quality product."
236,14,"before i purchased my echo, i thought it would be a mere novelty item. admittedly, i could survive without it, but it has definitely made my life easier and a bit more fun! alexa has proven herself to be more helpful than i would have imagined.she helps wake me up with her insightful flash briefings, while in the shower (yes, we have a very intimate relationship). she can play just about any song or type of music for me through prime music. she is even a great sous chef, helping me convert measurements, set timers, and update my shopping list. i have her hooked up with my smart lights, so that i can turn the lights off with my voice from bed. she even talks to my tesla and tells it to turn on the heater on cold mornings, so that i have a warm car to get in to. i enjoyed her company so much, that i got her a little sister, the echo dot. now i can talk to alexa in the kitchen and bathroom! i love that they can play music in sync, so that i can walk around my house and hear it from all rooms.all in all, it is a great device, and i know it will keep getting smarter and adding new features, which is awesome. the speaker is surprisingly good for such a small speaker. it obviously will not be able to compete with a large theater system, but for my small apartment, it is perfect. i also love the stylish cover. it looks super classy sitting on my kitchen counter, so i do not feel embarrassed about having a virtual assistant sitting in my kitchen. i had a slight issue with my echo when i got a new router, but i contacted the amazon support people, who were able to help me through it. great support team by the way!"
237,14,"little or no fm radio reception here. yes i have a collection of bluetooth speakers but the music selection and the multiple steps to connect and control audio via phone/tablet/pc are a pita.for years, i was concerned about evesdropping and ignored the echo phenomena. that said, in a moment of weakness i ordered a dot and my world changed. i use it in my study with and without paired bluetooth speakers and i do not have to lift a finger to switch between the output or play anything from siruisxm to radio stations to digital music collections and more. the very next day i ordered an echo 2.the living area is another situation. sure i can pair my phone/tablet to the high-end sony soundbar to rock the house but yet again, it required multiple steps to do so and control it. since the so is mortified by any kind of unapproved music forced upon her, i decided to emply an echo 2 so that i can quickly start, stop and control radio and unlimited music selections with as little drama as possible from the breakfast table.i can now blabber to alexa in any tone of voice in order to get the job done. plus, both the dot and echo 2 have hearing that is far better than mine. she responds without error from across a large living area even when music is playing. damn the reviews but the sound quality is plenty good enough and you can easily connect it to other speakers if you want to host a house or pool party. dot aside, i really do not understand all the griping about sound quality. i was delighted that the echo 2 has enough fidelity and volume to satisfy me and annoy the so. the echo product family is supremely engineered and one of the best products that i have ever purchased--and there have been too many to count.disclosure: after dot, i uploaded my entire digital music collection to amazon music. while it is comparably under-featured when compared to other mobile players, it works very well with the echo products and i can listen to my collection sans zero drama and effort.update: after nearly a week of listening, it is true that the lower mid-range of some types of music and individual tracks are muddled and alexa is voice and voice output in general is a tad loud with too much bass. however, i am confident that an update will eventually smooth everything out. that said, i wish equalization was available in the alexa app in order to tailor the sound for the environment and the type of music. i also found that speaker placement is critical. at first i had it 8"" from the wallls in a corner which caused the bass to boom. i moved it in front of a flat wall and it sounded better. i think that the further away from walls the better in order to accomodate the 360-degree sound. i think that ultimately it would sound the best in a middle of a room but who has power outlets located there (a kitchen island comes to mind)? finally, i would like auto sound levelling because when my daily briefing switches from staid and bassy npr to noisy reuters tv, the volume jumps condsiderably. nevertheless, i still love this well-designed piece of kit but note that i use it like a radio at mostly lower volumes. thanks amaon for bringing back a hands-free radio+ experience for somebody that gets minimal radio reception."
238,14,"first, i cannot compare this to the 1st generation as i did not own that.  let me add some things that i like and some items i wish echo would havepros1.  love the setup for morning to wake up,  have traffic/weather and latest on cnbc/npr/fox news - etc.  really cool2.  can read select kindle books - which is kinda of cool.3. have used it to access my iphone(blue tooth)  and pandora.  enjoy that4.  funny to hear alec baldwin wake up as an alarm5.  like the ability to walk around and give vocal commands6.  app setup is cool and probably going to improve over time.7.  speaker sound is pretty good - no complaints and i notice bad audio when i hear it.wish it did have:1.  ability to browse like the google version does.  alexa is limited in it is ability to search outside of set parameters2.  as usa today indicated - probably $2000 to setup for smart home use.  do not see me using that feature.3.  probably can get cheaper on black friday - somewhere i saw a $79 price tag - but $99 is a fair price for this and i have enjoyed the first week of it."
239,14,"i received this as a gift from my brother.  i had been to his house and had a lot of fun with his.  he surprised me with this and echo dot (2nd gen).  they are both fun and useful--i use them as intercoms in the house, ask them to play music, ask for the weather when i do not have my phone or computer nearby, ask how local traffic is, ask for a joke.....and probably thousands of other things i have not even tried yet!  the first day i had it i asked what i could substitute for an ingredient i did not have for a recipe!"
240,14,"pros:arrived on time without any damage.super easy to setup and integrate into your home network.my parents seem to be taking a liking to it.alexa is pretty smart if you ask the right question. if a question is asked that alexa is aware she has short comings on she will preface her answer. an example of this is my parents asked about birds, she replied that she does not know too much about that yet but did attempt to answer still.lots of ""skills"" you can add to her to augment her knowledge.did not answer questions about ip address or mac address.pretty good speech recognition.cons: i do not see anything that is alarmingly bad about the echo. the only thing i have to look into is the separation of information about my amazon account and people who i added to my family group."
241,14,"i think the alexa program and idea is great. i have my house wired up for automation now and it is been fantastic. i also loved the idea of better sound playing throughout my home, so i bought two of the echo 2nd generation. after less than a month i started having issues with the echos ability to hear commands. i reset, restarted, tried all the tricks, but i always felt like i had to yell the alexa commands to get it to respond. meanwhile my echo dot can hear me from two rooms away. i would be directing my command to the echo, and my while it was having issues my dot would pick it up from my bedroom. i contacted customer service who sent me a return label and a note saying, yeah it is an issue we are working on please stick it out or return it. so i returned them, bought a couple more dots along with the mokcao power + speaker to dock them in. now i will have solid sound and a device that can actually hear/respond."
242,14,"i love this thing. love alexa is songs, and we have had fun with her jokes. i purchased 2tp-link bulbs and the mini plug. set up the plug with a coffee pot that just has an on/off toggle switch, and it works perfect with the echo. once i set it all up i realized it will save me lots of steps. began making my first grocery list today. i go to sleep at night with distant thunderstorm ambiance sounds and wake to good morning, coffee started, the weather, and a news briefing. we had company over and picked alexa is ai brain.  love the humor they have built into her. i bought one for the den and one for the bedroom. oh yah, and she can call my friends on my contact list, or any phone number i ask her to, and i do not even have to pick up my cell phone. it was really easy to add my calendar to echo. we are very pleased and anxious to see new things added."
243,14,"not happy with this over-hyped new echo.  i just received my device a couple of days ago and am very disappointed at the sound quality.yes, i do have the latest firmware update.  i thought the 2nd gen echo would be comparable in sound to a jbl charge, but it is not even close.this device lacks mid-range and bass. after several years of the echo line of products, i thought amazon would get this one right.amazon please make a product comparable to the jbl, bose, or sonos devices.  i will gladly pay a little more."
244,14,"i purchased 3 2nd generation echos soon after release. initially, i was not impressed with sound quality. then a software update drastically changed (improved) that, and i grew to love them more.i prefer spotify vs amazon music (sorry amazon) and struggled with no multiroom support with spotify. you guessed it - a software update just received and boom, spotify throughout my apartment.absolutely pleased with my echo trio. any more improvements will only be icing on the cake as the only 2 drawbacks have been corrected.i withheld my review, as early adopters should expect to find issues that will need to be improved upon and hope that the manufacturer will do what is right for the product and consumer. well, amazon has done just that with the 2nd gen echo."
245,14,6 stars... my life is complete now it is truly amazing.. sound feels really immersive.. mics are super sensitive can easily catch your voice from a good 12+ feet without even trying... skills are great too.. this is my 2nd alexa device ( 1st being fire hd 10 ) but this one is way more sensitive.. i also like how the two devices intercommunicate to determine which is closer and which can provide better response.. also i love the design and how its more furniture/decor accessory than an actual bulky speaker.. gray blends in perfectly
246,14,"expectations were high but the reality of echo falls way short. this device is primarily a tool for amazon to sell you monthly subscriptions for music and prime. alexa will simply not answer many questions, especially political ones, and claims not to know a lot of things that you would expect her to. clearly she has been programmed to steer clear of any topic that might be considered controversial, which lowers her fun quotient considerably. she refuses to report point spreads and over/under on sports - what is up with that??? and the ability to turn on/off various appliances is not nearly as seamless as one might expect. pricey, additional devices are required as well as a rather convoluted synchronization process that requires internet connectivity. it is do-able, but hardly plug-and-play. on the other hand, the sound quality of this particular device is pretty robust considering its size - but do not think it is going to replace true hi-fi equipment for serious listening. bottom line, echo is mostly a curiosity. i gave it to my girlfriend for christmas and we hardly use it at all after only two weeks. the novelty wore off quickly. i would not buy another one or recommend that anybody else do so."
247,14,"yes, i do like the new unit ... sound is good, price is much better than original ... but performance is no better than the original.  i currently have an original echo, 2 echo dots, an echo tap, and the ""new"" echo.  i have a dot in master bedroom with a split pair of bose speakers wired, a dot in my office connected (wired) to a sony sound system, the original and new echos in living room and kitchen/dining room (open floor plan) ... tap is in my garage and is often taken out to patio in good weather.frustrating to me is using music group ... which now appears to work well on amazon music, but not when requesting siriusxm (which will only work on an individual unit).  tech support swore the problem would be fixed about a month ago in two days.  if this is a siriusxm licensing limitation ... say so!"
248,14,"love love love these devices. they are so helpful in so many ways. music - the sound is amazing for what it is. if you are expecting concert speaker sound out of a device that has a 2 something"" speaker in it, your delusional. have a bose soundlink color ii and the echo is comparable. the only thing missing is the deep bass you get with a bose but that is not to say that it does not have good bass. put in the right location, it sounds amazing. mine sits in a corner on a mini shelf at about 5'6"" off the floor. ease of use - alexa, (fill in the blank). it is so easy! and with all the skills available you can do so many things. just have to take the time to see what is out there. smart home - have 4 phillips hue bulbs in the house and i am hooked! can not wait to get more smart devices. if you are going to have ten or less then just buy the echo plus that has the built in hub otherwise, buy a starter kit that has a ""bridge"" and control up to 50 devices with alexa or from your alexa app from anywhere in the world that you can get service. routines - an alarm for me that tells me the weather for the day, an alarm for my 6yr old daughter that tells her she is awesome and can do anything she puts her mind to and turns my lights off for me and 10pm and on at 4am for my wife."
249,14,"i received this echo as a christmas gift. in rating it, i can not separate the echo device from the alexa service that is integrated into it. i do not listen to music very much, so i can not comment on the sound quality from that aspect. however, the alexa voice is clear and responsive. since i have internet access in a rural area through a limited bandwidth service plan, i monitor data usage closely. i have noticed that, since having the echo, my usage has increased about 0.5gb per day. every command or question alexa responds to causes a data hit on my bandwidth both when the data goes out to the amazon servers and then again when the response comes back to the echo at my home. this is not necessarily a bad thing, but i was not prepared for it. amazon does not advertise any typical data usage that would go along with using the device with alexa. i also use the echo/alexa to control some smart-home devices, such as smart plugs. this works well, but also requires the echo/alexa to communicate with the amazon servers to understand the voice commands and provide the spoken responses. no communication or processing happens locally within my wifi network. so if i had high bandwidth cable-based internet access, i would rate the echo/alexa four or five stars. but since i do not, and amazon did not inform me in their marketing literature what the data usage hit might be, i cannot give it more than three stars."
250,14,"this is a lesson learned in not to run out and buy ""the new and improved"" version of a product without knowing the difference.  on the positive side, yes, it has a boomier bass, but this is at a price.  the midrange seems to suffer leaving just highs and lows.  i miss having the ""ring dial"" at the top where i can just walk up to it to turn the volume up and down.  now i have to turn lights on in a room or have a flashlight to see the plus and minus buttons like on the dot model.  there is also a definite difference in the sensitivity of the microphones ring at the top.  seems like i am yelling to have it hear me.  actually the older model in the other room hears me just fine when actually i was talking to this one.all in all, i am ok with it, but would not buy any more."
251,14,"this purchase was a really frustrating introduction into the world of smart speakers. within minutes of opening the box, i ran into issues. first, the echo was unable to pair with my phone. there was a repeated message stating that my phone number was already associated with another device (it was not). this necessitated my first call to amazon. after that issue was fixed, i attempted to use the echo for basic tasks. alexa could not recognize my requests to play specific pandora radio stations saved to my pandora account after pairing with pandora. this essentially limited me to playing top 40 type music with easily recognizable band names, defeating one of the main purposes of having a smart speaker. next, i tried to pair the echo with the amazon fire stick in my home. alexa could not do that ether, necessitating a second call to amazon in two days. i was told that the echo could not pair with the fire stick because the fire stick was linked to my lady friend is amazon account. i would have to reregister the fire stick under my account if i wanted access to this feature. additionally, i tried to set up my calendars. it turns out that if you have more than one gmail account, you have to pick one of them. good luck if you have a work and personal calendar in separate gmail accounts.as an aside, amazon touts echo is ability to help you with amazon shopping as a big selling point. this feature is useless for the millions of people like me that like to look at products and compare prices and reviews from various websites before making a purchase. people also point to the thousands of ¡°skills¡± amazon can learn as a selling point. in reality, the vast majority of these skills are either useless or slight modifications of the same concepts by different app designers. the key word is app. these skills are not ¡°learned,¡± they are downloads from software developers complete with ads.if you have a ton of high end smart home products like the latest iterations of a roomba, a phillips hue bulb, or a smart door lock, sure, the echo may be great for you. but virtually all competitors offer this same connectivity, so even that is not much of a selling point.i am leaving two stars because the product does have some basic functionality and decent sound quality.in sum, this smart home device is not all that smart."
252,14,"this is a close to useless device despite the heavy promoting of ""alexa"". ""help"" is so crude that it cannot answer a basic questions such as ""how do i add a different sound/music to my wake up alarm?""  the response to that is to go to the alexa menu. i have searched every category and sub-category. there is nothing about customizing the sounds other than by choosing one of the offered harsh, clanging standard noises. supposedly i can change the wake up word for the device by going to settings, selecting the device, and scrolling down to ""wake word"". however, there is no ""wake word"" listed under the device. there are many ways to spend money on amazon just by asking alexa, but i have no interest in that. the best i can say about the apps is that they appear to be free."
253,14,"at the suggestion of a friend, i decided to try the alexa echo lifestyle.  at first, i could not imagine what i would use it for.  why the heck would i need to ask alexa to do for me???  well, i bought the echo show along with an echo and and echo dot.  i was immediately hooked!  i began with smart plugs, then some smart bulbs.  then i bought an echo plus, the one with the hub.  after figuring it all out, i ended up returning the echo plus and i bought 3 more echo dots.  with two of the dots, i bought mokcao power+ cordless speaker with battery base for amazon echo dot 2nd generation (https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/b0749k9c1t/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=utf8&psc=1)'  i found that this speaker with a dot gave me as good or better sound than having a full echo or an echo plus.  the bonus is that each of them is portable so i can take it anywhere and treat it as a bluetooth speaker.  the 3rd dot is now hard wired to my 7.1 suround system in my gameroom and the 4th wired to my bose wave radio in my garage.  so, as you can guess, i am all in with alexa.  the dots are great if you can hook the up with a speaker as i have done with two or a stereo system as i have with the other two.  the echo show is the one we have in our morning room, the room we spend 90% of our time.  the reason is that it has very good sound quality all by itself and the screen is great for seeing lirics of songs.  but it best for linking your photos up to amazon photos and playing all of your photos like a digital picture frame."
254,14,after having an echo dot for some time and having to connect to a external speaker for music we decided to give this new echo a try some reviews have said the sound was bad but after connecting and getting the updates our alexa has come alive and the sound is great everything has improved and the volume is outstanding and bass is good with dolby kudos for amazon for getting the firmware updates out as quick as they did now we are very happy with our new echo setup was fast and easy and it reconnected with our smart plugs for lights using the alexa app we are going to replace our second echo dot upstairs as well with this new one and for the better price of 79 bucks you cant beat it..
255,14,"works well and most of the skills work out of the box.  i only found the skill for the personal weather station not to work.  the smart home devices work flawlessly.  its nice not to have to search out my phone to turn on or off lights, cameras or change my thermostats.  music sounds very good for such a small footprint.  not a data hog either.  only uses data when streaming or responding to your commands unlike google home which constantly eats data.  good for a limited data connection."
256,14,"i¡¯m a google home user but was curious to try out the echo. opted for this one for better sound quality over the dot. it is attractive, built well and sounds decent. calling alexa feels natural compared to google but i find it is also easier to unintentionally trigger the call even when mentioning her name during conversation. the sound is loud but without any eq adjustments it comes out almost too bass-y and muddy. i¡¯m a huge fan of the blue ring. i¡¯ve been having glitchy sound and occasional connection issues too. lastly setup was a royal pain. took several tries, a router reboot and several password attenpts. amazon really needs to refine the alexa app experience and connection. ultimately it is nice but it feels a bit like a smart talking toy for me to keep."
257,14,"never did get the alexa app to work on amazon prime blu r1hd android phone. tried samsung phone, and that did not work either. this was christmas day afternoon. but it is amazon. you gonna tell me they were slammed with setups they could not handle. we eventually connected using a borrowed iphone.  but it was frustrating.after a day of use, it is kinda fun. we bought it mainly to play music and are happy with prime music. speaker is just fine. set it up to make phone calls to family via alexa. that will have limited use, i am sure.it is basically a cd player at our house, but for the black friday price, it is about right. we may find some other uses as time passes."
258,14,"we love it!alexa is a part of the family now and the sound quality here is good-- especially with some coordinated, bluetooth speakers around the room and house. had it synched and running in minutes and lead us to add another echo in our bedroom and fire tv in the living room. never thought we would be any kind of 'wired' house, but we are glad to have finally given-in. whether answering questions, looking things up, or playing music, this echo and alexa are great!be aware: when you add a second echo, amazon raises the music library price, even with a prime membership. and many add on apps and services have their own cost, too, so watch out for your budget!"
259,14,"we like the improved sound and smaller size, along with the fabric cover that helps alexa compliment our decor. the only negative (minus one star) was the change in volume control. two individual buttons versus turning the top like a dial. do not like that very much at all. sure, you can still ask her to turn the volume up or down, but we also enjoyed the convenience of turning the top of the echo for volume control present on the first generation echo. alexa is still evolving, thus not as smart as you might expect, but she is getting better. our new echo is now controlling our holiday lights (requires purchase of smart compatible plugs) with great ease. ""alexa, turn on the holiday lights"" and the house lights up with christmas cheer. a welcome addition to the family."
260,10,"i absolutely love the echo! i made my cat a playlist of frog croaks, bird tweets, gregorian monk chants and cat purrs. this echo tells me how long my drive to work is, weather, sports updates, news. reads wikipedia articles, reads my kindle books, sets alarms, tells jokes. now that i have alexa i dumped my boyfriend for intelligent conversation. thanks amazon!"
261,14,"did not work or respond, wasted time item defective."
262,14,"i bought the 3-pack deal and this review applies to all three. most reviews complain about the sound quality but i did not notice that so much.- lack of responsewhat bothered me the most was the unresponsiveness. the wake word works great, even at a whisper it will start listening, but it very frequently does not hear the command and just keeps listening and listening... and listening. my 1st gen would stop listening pretty quick if it does not hear anything or respond with ""i do not understand"" or something, the 2nd gen seems to listen forever and does not respond to even yelling at it. the times that it does respond, answers are often cut off: ""alexa, what is the speed of light?"" - ""light is top speed is 299 mil"" with a little static noise as it cuts out.- lowest spoken volume is too loudthe second annoyance is that the ""level 1"" volume is much louder than the 1st gen ""level 1"". with the 1st gen i usually kept it around 3 or 4 when listening to music and 2 when i am working and want some background music, but with the 2nd gen, i usually have it on 1 or 2 and have to get up and press the volume down button to get a quieter volume.also, when i have it on 1 and my sister ""drops in"" on me, the music resumes at level 3 afterward instead of going back to 1.- glitchythere are also other occasional glitches, like one time my sister dropped in and the volume did ""not"" go up for the conversation, also sometimes the music volume does not go down when the echo is listening.- alarm does not worki set two daily morning alarms and they both have failed to ring! i checked the settings multiple times.i am very happy with the 1st gen, it misunderstands me less than 10% of the time but it does or says something. not being heard over 50% of the time with the 2nd gen is too much to take. i tested all three and reset one of them twice with no change."
263,14,i really would give this 4.5 stars as it is an improvement over the echo but now has limitations on what it can control unless you buy the upgraded version.  sound is good for its size and price.  the product fits into my theory on cell phone marketing in that there are a lot of tweeks that could have been added but are held back for future releases [got to keep those future sales up!!].  i will not mention names but my employers always hold a potful proven tweeks back for the next year or more releases.  i understand it is the game we have to play and i like getting paychecks.  this is not an expensive product so it is worth buying for the enjoyment.  i would not put the cloth covered version in a kitchen area that is subject to spills or splashes.
264,14,"so far loving it, which it has a google look feature. it is very limited on researching and typically goes to wikpedia in a round about way. i am still learning how to ""command"". can be frustrating as all get out. the one think that is a plus, it actually understands my speech where my car/navigation system does not and i have no accent. think does basic stuff and you will enjoy. my favorite i using it for music and also the app is on my phone so plug and play in the car! you can ask to play play lists on amazon prime music and then ask to add a song you like in that moment of hearing it, to your amazon music library which is same on your app on cellphone. the best feature is the amazing sound.......omg. even on low or loud volume you can say ""alexa"" and it will hear you with a special layered (?) speaker and stop and wait for your command. i have yet to try making phone calls through it as you have to go into the site and log in and add permissions for contacts/add. it does keep everything you say in the amazon site is app log and you have to go log into delete and its delete all or not. just keep that in mind, site says its for alexa to ""learn you"" yet your information is out there. i am not sure if your phone conversations are but i would be interested in knowing what all is being ""kept"" that anyone says."
265,14,"i honestly do not understand people who say the echo is not a good speaker. the sound quality on this thing is phenomenal. and do not get me started on the bass. the beat really does drop with the echo. the microphone is highly effective. i have tried whispering alexa from my bed (5 feet away) and she hears me. i also talk to her all the way from the kitchen (mostly for music controls) and the echo responds accordingly.now lets talk about alexa. i have used all the main ai assistants, google assistant, siri and s-voice. alexa excels where they fail; she has a unique and clear cut personality. unlike the others, alexa is super playful so i get the feeling that i am talking to a super enthusiastic assistant, or even a friend. alexa just feels more human compared to the others. specifically she has a variety of human-like responses to questions. i just asked her ""alexa, how are you today"" and she replied ""i came down with the case of the acting bug but i have got it out of my system for now."" she was actually ""sick"" the previous days and even coughed yesterday. i am glad she is fine now.i also love her many skills, especially playing the millionaire game and the magic door. you also need to try her many easter eggs. she replied to numerous movie lines such as ""are these the droids you are looking for and ""say hello to my little friend."" lastly, if you have not tried it ask your echo (or future echo) to sing. you will not be disappointed."
266,14,"i can not get the damn thing connected. i entered the wrong wifi password initially and now it will not let me correct my mistake. i tried starting over, but it refuses to forget my original password error. it tells me to exit the set up and start again. i thought i did exit. why the hell will not it let me start fresh?"
267,14,"having had the original echo since it was released a few years ago, i had high expectations for the second generation model. there have been so many features added to the alexa command list over the years, so i was looking forward to adding a less expensive unit in every room so we could communicate and control things throughout the house.pro:-it works well to search and give basic commands to our firetv in the theater room.con:-you are tied into the amazon ecosystem of voice-controlled apps (hackers can use custom skills for popular apps, like kodi).-navigating grouped selections is still done best with the remote, unless you know exactly which search item you want to play.pro:-setting them up to play the same music in each room works well. ""alexa, play pandora everywhere""con:-not everyone wants to listen to the same music (or any music at all), but it will start playing anyway.-sometimes it plays ""everywhere"" even when you only want it to play on the local device. have not figured out why yet.-the sound quality is not nearly as good as the first-generation model (i would recommend gen1 if they are the same or less price)pro:-the drop in feature allows you to name each device and communicate between devices, i.e. ""drop in on kitchen""con:-it is slow to connect, and you receivers are not offered a choice to reject the call. ""alexa, do not disturb"" is an option.-when you are done talking you have to tell alexa to sever the connection.-my son drops in to say ""hi dad"" and other nonsense. hopefully the novelty wears off fast i will be using the ""do not disturb"" command.pro:-the cloth finishes are very attractive. i bought one of each color to help identify units if they are moved.con:the plastic faux-wood finishes cost more? fortunately, removable skins will be happily fulfilled by the aftermarket.other thoughts:i have not for the life of me been able to make my home ""smart"" with these, but i am still working on installing more ""smart things"" to enable more commands. the ecobee (thermostat) and several z-wave light switches (i have many 3-way, which becomes expensive) will be going in over the next weeks and my samsung smart things hub is already installed. i was able to sync it to my yamaha musiccast receiver, and use it for some limited controls, but yamaha software leaves much to be desired, the bluetooth connection was not very stable and when i shut off the alexa it did not power down the receiver (my epson projector does with hdmi-cec, which is nice) also considering a z-wave deadbolt for easy entry. i have not tested the new ""phone call"" feature, because i carry my phone in my pocket.if this is anything like the orignal echo, it was useless for the first couple of months, until the software caught up with the hardware. i have a feeling this smaller version will be the same and get better with time. for instance, better integration with yamaha, sonos and other ""smart"" wireless sound systems. until then, if you want good sound, get the cheaper dot and hook up external speakers or the gen1 echo. if you want a visual clock, weather, picture frame, etc, get the show (we miss the clock display after replacing our bedroom logitech boom with the alexa). if sound quality is unimportant or you have a small room, and you want something that looks good (not a plastic pringle can), with a built in speaker, these do nicely."
268,14,"i am such a fan, i have caught myself missing her while running errands and almost talked to her the other day in the doctors office! i wish i had had this when my kids were in the ""but why?"" phase, it is so nice to ask them if they asked alexa and this is not about putting off my kids - we talk a lot, but this is about when they have a ton of questions and i am not google, i admit it is interesting to hear the answers she gives. also i would like to note that my two youngest have begun to speak much more clearly, the peer pressure of getting snickered at because you are not understood does wonders and we are a loving family so there are no bad feelings just rueful exasperation from the mush-mouthed questioner. i will say i wish alexa interacted better with manners, it might sound ridiculous to some people but manners matter and it is a social habit that should be maintained at all times. the sound quality is really good, though i wish for better bass.. a future add on feature perhaps? i am a little sad the wake word is so limited, i would like to name this new family member like i did the others both kids and fur-kids. i also wish the timer sounds were different, they blend into a busy household - last i checked between the alarm and timer sounds one was customizable and the other was not and yes this makes a big difference when using alexa on the fly. perhaps some meme-ish sounds from pop culture and movies as an alert?"
269,14,"really loving this amazon echo 2nd generation so far.  i have the original echo and it having a hard time hearing me most of the time, it was really big as well, though the speaker was loud it feels like it has no bass at all at high volume.  i decided to give the amazon echo 2nd generation it a try when it was finally marked down to $79.99, and what a difference it has made.the design is small and compact that it fits better anywhere you place it.  i was worried that the sound quality would be bad since it is so much smaller, but the volume is really loud at max and it has more bass then the original.  i am really impressed with the built-in mic, it now has 7 mic built-in pointing in all direction of the speaker.  it can hear me much further and understand me much better now. i also bought a smart power strip with this and plug in many of my electronic devices and it has made my life a lot better and i feel like living in the future.  i can now just say ""alexa turn tv on"" ""alexa turn printer on.""  i can also use it as a blue tooth speaker to play my music when i go to sleep.overall, it was worth it and definitely recommended it.  be even better when you can get it while it is on sale, then it is a definite steal!"
270,14,"impressive device. so much smarter than siri. we have a brand new 2nd gen unit and we already love it. with all the available skills and the ease of use, this is an amazing useful piece of tech. we are so excited. it understands everything we are asking for and so far has delivered answers that are accurate and on point. i was not aware of all the apps and services that can be used with this. and yes, you can connect your iphone via bluetooth and play apple music via streaming. however with amazon music memberships dirt cheap i do not see why you would not do that instead."
271,14,"while more aesthetically pleasing the generation 1 model, the sound quality is significantly poorer. played side-by-side, you can hear the difference, more mechanical, with focus on the highs causing the mid and lows to suffer. i would recommend purchasing the gen 1 and avoiding this model.another feature that could be in the plus / minus column, depending on your current setup: gen 2 is more sensitive to sound so if you have a gen 1 and are speaking, the gen 2 will often pick up your voice even though you are standing closer to the gen 1. it means repeating yourself less but then you have a unit playing something in the wrong room.i recommend alexa in general but not the gen 2 device"
272,14,"i have only had my echo a few days and am still figuring it all out, but i am pleased with what i have seen so far.i am not extremely technologically advanced, but have been using it to play music. it is set up in my bedroom, which is a larger than average master bedroom. the sound quality is extremely impressive. i can easily hear it even outside of the bedroom in another room. whether the volume is low or high, the sound quality is not compromised and the bass is excellent. it is much better than playing music from my smart tv, laptop or phone. i also like telling alexa what genre to play and letting her do the work to decide what song comes next. she keeps streaming great songs, some i have not heard in a long time and had forgotten about. i also use it for an alarm in the morning. i will try out the reminders and other features in the future.i am still figuring out how to sync it with my phone is bluetooth so i can stream youtube sometimes. my only complaint is it started talking in the middle of the night last night when i had already put it on 'do not disturb' mode. it scared me right out of the bed! hope that does not keep happening.i am happy with it overall and excited to see what else it can do. but even if you are only using it for music - it is excellent. no need for a fancy home surround system, just a few of these (depending on size of home) should do the trick."
273,14,this upgrade to the new alexa is well worth it the new speaker really packs a punch and it looks so much better than the original. only flaw is when playing spotify and giving the stop command there seema to be a delay where the music will resume for a second and then stop. this did not happen with the original it just stopped immiediatly. im sure this is something that will be taken care of with a software update!
274,14,"i have purchased 3 dots and a first generation  echo and now the 2nd generation echo. i was satisfied with my first echo, but amazon has not  lived up to its quality in sound. you dressed it nice with the cloth veneer but i rather have better sound. i am now wondering if i should even bother about buying the echo show. i would hate to invest that much money and be disappointed.overall i think alexa is great but you got to deliver what you promise!"
275,14,"first of all; i have never used any of the other devices made by other companies such as the google home, but amazon echo has been a joy to use and easy to set up.her skills are pretty great, i have only got a few that i use everyday. it is nice to know that she is programed to answer questions as though she were a person. i think the only major downside is that i live in a rural area, so some of alexa is skills like uber and dominos are not something i can use to my advantage.one of my wife and i is favorite features is the 'drop in' ability. as long as you have wifi and are using the alexa app, you can drop in from anywhere. it is so nice to not have to wait to dial one of our cell phones if we know one of us is home.one of the only other things i will mention in the way of a complaint, is that sometimes you have to be over specific when making a music request. alexa does not default to my purchased music library, but it could be a setting i am missing.in the end, we will be planning on getting at least one more echo and a show. alexa is a wonderful addition to any home."
276,14,i loved my echo 1st generation when i first got it after a while it started to be just good enough. so i started to look for something a little better. i got one of those speakers that u just add the dot to that sounded no better than the echo even though the reviews said it was better. when the 2nd generation echo went on sale for the holidays i figured i would give it a try... and i am glad i did it is such a  improvement over the echo and that dot speaker crap. i know a name brand like bose or sonos would be ideal but u can not muti room those with other echo is or dots (and i have one in just about every room) so i am very pleased with the quality and sound. i also like the smaller look of the 2nd generation echo and the muti room experience
277,14,"great idea but here are some of the many drawbacks. each echo can only be a member of 1 group plus itself. this is annoying as it would be nice to have the ability to have a whole house group plus the other smaller groups like; basement, bedrooms, main floor, party, etc.... and this should not be an add on pay more money feature. the echo will respond to non directed commands that do not remotely sound like the wake-up command. it listens to the tv, which is really annoying when an amazon echo ad comes on, but it will also wake up to a variety of voices from the tv. when one echo finishes my flash briefing, a second one will hear 'that is all from your flash briefing', wake up and start my flash briefing, with no wake-up command. why do i have to pay more money if i want to stream different music to more than 1 device or group at the same time? this last piece truly defeats the purpose of having more than one. it could use an internal battery that could enable the playing of music for 4+ hours. not make this an add on accessory, but a standard feature. the power cords are ugly, short and annoying.if they can correct the above without charging more, this is a very nice item. the music sounds great, the apps are expanding. it looks good and is moderately easy to setup."
278,14,"i purchased an echo plus and two echo dots.  i also purchased unlimited music for the echo plus.  at first i was pleased to have such a library of music for 4 bucks a month on top of my amazon prime fees, which we have for other reasons.  but now i have become frustrated with how poorly alexa recognizes my requests to play music.  i often ask for the same albums as i am on a bit of a kick right now and one would think that alexa would rate recently listened-to albums as highly probable hits when processing requests.  but apparently that does not happen.  nor can i discern any heuristic learning from alexa is processing.for example, i get her to play a particular album, somtimes after a couple tries.  and yes, i am a native english speaker and i enunciate well.  i enunciate carefully and slowly.  she just played album a for me.  i ask her to pause, then to resume on my ""everywhere group"" which i had set up.  she cannot do it.  then i repeat the whole command.  ""alexa, play album <a> on everywhere group"".  she cannot find the album she was just playing.  i try again.  she starts playing something completely irrelevant because she does not wait for me to finish my command which i am trying to say carefully and slowly.  ""alexa!  you understood this a minute ago, why can not you understand it now?""  poor thing.  her artificial intelligence is not so intelligent.this is just an example.  sometimes i just give up in frustration.  when she gets it right, it is very good.  but there are days when it seems that success occurs less often then her blunders.  and all i am asking for is music.  nothing complicated."
279,11,"a good next generation. i would not say the sound is better across the board. the balance is better (though custom equalizer functionality would be much preferred), and the speakers are better (clearer). but, it does not do as well if its near a wall, especially a corner, and the lower top volume also makes high volume sound hollow to me - it just does not feel like its flooding the room at high volume like the 1st gen did. it was substantially cheaper then my 1st gen, so i am happy with it."
280,14,"i own both the echo (2nd generator) and the latest google home and acquired them for the music, news and weather info, not to run my house.  thought it would be helpful if i gave my experience with both.  the speakers for both units are roughly equal and very good.  the quality from such small units is really quite impressive.  personally and for my limited purposes i thought the google home was the ""smarter"" of the two.  example if i ask echo if today will be windy, i get weather forecast, largely consisting of the temperature, but no wind info.  ask the same of google home and i get the wind without all the rest (which it will provide if asked).  plus: google allows you to upload your personal music library and the home will play it.  amazon no longer allows that option.  the response time for both units is about the same and both are easy to set up .......  what makes echo a better choice for me is that i am a prime member and  as such i get much better music selection than on google home and i could upgrade to better selections for about an additional $4 a month after one month free trial.  to receive something similar from google it will cost you about $10 a month.  bottom line if you are not a prime member, google home seems like a better choice to me, particularly because of the uploading your music library feature.  because of that feature on google and being a prime member i acquired both.  regardless, they are both amazing pieces of equipment."
281,14,"let me start by saying that this is my first echo device. i got it because i know a few people who have them and they have recommended me to it. to make this review easy and to the point i have listed it is core aspects below and i will say what i like about them and what i do not like about them.1. design - the design of this device is quite stylish. it sports a black leather casing that can be swapped out at any time for a new case. if it happens to get dirty, just put a new one on and it is like new again!2. sound - with this being a speaker, you can not review it without talking about its sound quality. the sound quality on this is quite excellent for it is size and is able to be quite loud in a decent sized room. the highs are crisp and the bass is enough to make my desk rattle.3. alexa - alexa works okay on here. however, there are times (more often then not) where she can not hear me and i have to talk pretty loud. other times, she do a command that is the exact opposite of what i wanted her to do in the first place. this happens all the time and gets pretty annoying to the point where i just stop using it for a while.verdict - this speaker is small, stylish, and packs great sound into an inexpensive smart speaker."
282,14,"i have one first generation echo and one second generation echo and i love them both!  they are both wonderful inventions however, i can notice a difference. with the echo second generation is seven microphones it can hear me so much better from far away and easily distinguish what i am saying. i love the multi room music option as well. i have turned our echoes into a perfect intercom system for our house.the only negative thing i can think of is that alexa has difficulty with my husbands heavy hispanic accent, but even siri has a hard time with english that is less than perfect. i use alexa to add items to my grocery list, schedule events for all of my family members, and even to play relaxing sounds (my favorite is babbling brook) to help me go to sleep at night! she really is a wonderful personal assistant. i am considering buying one for my mom who lives alone."
283,14,"the green light flashed for two days- which i was not happy about- but mostly, it is often unresponsive to my commands, the volume is all across the board, her voice is much louder than music or the news and is jolting and annoying- the sound is not at all improved- it is muffled and has a low hiss ...and the variety of songs it plays are useless. i ordered amazon music only to find out that when i ask it to shuffle songs by the grateful dead, it only knows five of the most popular grateful dead songs. all in all, i do not feel that this was all it was cracked up to be- mostly i am tired of having to ask it to do things multiple times- and the crazy volume and voice issues.i am going to stick with my wireless speaker and the internet."
284,14,"can not remember life without this, and i have only had it a week! first one did not connect properly but amazon sent me a new one immediately before i even returned the first. second one connected seamlessly to my internet. absolutely love that i can set timers, alarms, get the weather, news and play games all just by speaking in my room. buying another for my office at work. 1 * off because the build of this is not what it could be. the sides are soft and could easily be torn or bent if it fell over. i brought a great stand to go with it but a case  or stand should come with it because of the speaker material on the sides of it. since i order from amazon four or five times a week, i love to be able to ask where my order is get updates etc. my daughter has a dot and the quality and sound between the dot and echo is vastly different and worth the difference in price. i only wish it would connect to more music apps. i use slacker and would like that to connect as well as the music that is stored on my phone. it would be nice if it could play the playlist i have already built on my device. hopefully that will be added. also would like different name options. it is petty, but i do not like alexa so i call mine echo but would like more than three choices to wake it up"
285,14,"!!! update: 2017.11.04 - amazon pushed an update to 2 of my new echo is (the 3rd was not on line yet) - the new software version is 592452420.  the update made a noticeable improvement in the sound; better bass but still slightly shallow.  i then set up my 3rd echo (software version 588443420) and the sound was night and day.  i played a mix of the same songs side by side and the updated device sounds much better.  i have raised my rating from 2 stars to 4 - hoping additional updates will make this even better.i had high hopes for the 2nd generation echo and like many others, pre-ordered the 3-pack based on the promise of ""improved sound"".  the sound is much worse than the original echo and i would even say that the tap sounds better than this...but i guess amazon did not lie...the 2nd generation echo does sound better than the dot.  but seriously, the sound quality is horrible for music - almost zero base and very ""tinny"" at volume, it is almost like a tin can with a speaker.  there is a slight improvement in vocals and alexa is voice - if you are looking for an aesthetically pleasing voice assistant and playing music is not a priority, this may be for you - but for enjoying music, this is a fail.  i will give this a few days to see if amazon makes any firmware changes - or see if there is a ""break-in period"" as some had mentioned, but will most likely be returning."
286,14,"bought three for the special pricing and opened one to compare side by side against the original.  i played a dozen different type of songs back and forth between the two.i have a great ear for sound and i could not honestly tell the difference! i was very surprised after reading how they were supposed to be improved and sound so much better! i returned all of them.what they really need is an equalizer within the amazon app so you can adjust to your liking.if this could be fixed by a simple software update as someone else wrote about, it would have been nice amazon informed me during my return process. i might have given it another try!"
287,14,"good for the price. this is a unit that probably would be normally about $150 if it were another brand. it is an amazon product so that means value, not necessarily a great quality product, but nevertheless a decent product for the cost of it.the sound is above average until you go up to about 75-80% and then the bass diminishes. the sound is at its best around half way up or around 60% volume.alexa does not get what i ask her but that could be my accent so i cannot blame her for that.the phone answer did not work for me while the music was playing so i returned the echo connect device. it basically answered the phone while it was playing the music so you and the person on the phone could hear the music and did not carry the conversation because of it.i still have not used a smart device with it so cannot comment on it.overall i give this product a 4 stars for it is sound quality and the product looks and the material used to make it.perhaps i should have purchased the echo plus, i do not know? compared to apple homepod it is inferior but so is the price as apple is product costs 5 times more than echo and almost 3 times more than echo plus."
288,14,got this as a christmas gift for my parents. at first i thought being a different generation than myself that they would return it due to the possibility they would not even use it. boy was i wrong!within the first week it has changed the life is of my entire house. my mother will ask alexa to play her favorite songs and use it to make phone calls as well as answer our home phone calls since we also have the echo connect. we have now purchased echo dots for every room in our house and love using the drop in command as an in home intercom system and now no longer have to yell from the top of our lungs to other family members when we need them or have a question for them. we simply drop into their echo dot and communicate with ease.
289,14,"in spite of all the new smart speakers with an ai companion of their own hitting the market, amazon is still dominating the market as they are way ahead of the curve. the amazon echo was recommended to me by a friend and this beautiful speaker lived up to my expectations of it. with ton is of skills (apps that alexa uses) it can learn, your voice control ambitions will not be led astray. i would write a 10 paragraph review, but you can type it in google if you want to see what the echo is capable of. i am definitely happy with its capabilities and functions and use it as the entertainment center of my home. i really do the love the ability to ready your kindle books similar to how siri will read aloud on your iphone. but if you purchase audible books as well, alexa will play those as well. keep up the good work amazon!"
290,14,what can i say...i own 2 echos and 2 dots...they are so convenient and now have so much capability.  i have got mine connected to my dish products so navigating channels is effortless!  streaming music throughout our home is now possible with connecting all 4 echo devices together for whole home music!  i have one of the original echos which has been awesome...the new one is quite a bit smaller and very nice looking.  the material used is a nice quality and just adds a nice touch to the normal black metal body.  the sound quality is quite good as well and it seems like the microphone for listening is slightly better on this than my original.  overall we are very happy with our alexa devices and if you do not own one...what are you waiting for?
291,14,"can not say i enjoyed the hassle when amazon delivered my echo to someone else. it took hours for customer service to admit the mistake after first insisting it was still on the truck despite the notice it had been delivered to my door. customer service was a train wreck, and i lost track of how many support personnel i  talked with between them losing my echo and me trying to set it up to actually play my music. but i can not fault the echo itself. it does what amazon said it would do. and, it is sure nice laying in bed asking echo what the time is or what the day is weather will be. alexa does need some continuing  refinement which i am sure amazon will do. echo sounds great at higher volumes but begi1ns to sound 'tinny' like my first transistor radio at lower volumes. alexa is writers need to work a bit on their jokes. when i had to explain most of the humor to my grandson, i felt like many of the jokes never really hit their target of actually being funny. i wondered, too, whether i would started talking in my sleep when one night i was awakened by alexa playing a piece from my music collection. it has not happened since. but it is a stitch when i watch a youtube video to learn more about using my echo, echo responds to commands given in the video demonstrations. over all, it is a nice piece of technology that i would recommend as a future purchase. when paired with my prime account, or even better with music unlimited, it was a good decision for me  to acquire."
292,14,"we¡¯re really happy with our echos. bought six to put throughout the house. one would not stay online and amazon immediately sent a replacement the next day. my kids have learned to play music that irritates their siblings- the echo devices allow each room to be ¡°connected.¡±  so if i want to turn down the music in one of my kids rooms, i can do that. easy to use as an intercom. these are fun and useful. music sounds great. no complaints. the look nice too."
293,14,"way too much bass when playing music.. it causes the vocals to be drowned out. it causes the vocals to be difficult to discern from the surrounding thump thump thump of the bass. believe it or not, amazon, but not every person wants to listen to a pounding bass. i have the echo dot and i much prefer to listen to music with the dot than with this full-size echo.and it is hard to believe, but there is no way to adjust the bass or treble. heck, my inexpensive sears stereo from the 1970 is had adjustable bass and treble!!! i am very disappointed by this full-size echo."
294,14,"at first i was pi s s ed at the hyped up so called bass on this unit. what bass?then, i repositioned it to properly listen to said bass. what do you know??? there it was. it is pretty cool for its size. definitely way better sound quality than the echo predecessors. i am enjoying it.alexa still is pretty ""dumb"" for a smart device or i am too lazy to properly train the proper skills, or just short on time. my echo family is growing though. they are good devices as a general statement, with decent support if ever needed and great warranties even on the remanufactured models. this model did step it up. it is a good sounding device in this price range.keep in mind, where you place this device has everything to do with how it is going to sound. give it a shot. it is worth it!"
295,14,"plenty has been written about what these do, so this addresses differences between 1st and 2nd generation. we have both. the new model is shorter and a little thicker, but it does not have the rotating volume ring at the top of the 1st gen. however, the exterior choices and smaller size do blend better with home decor. power supplies appear to be the same. both support bluetooth and wifi, however the 2nd gen has a jack for an external speaker. there are a few technical differences that would matter to smart home enthusiasts or those wanting to use the device for phone calls. neither applies to us.what does matter is sound quality. neither unit will surprise or delight in this area. however, if you have a 1st gen unit and are tempted to change to the 2nd gen for sound quality, do not. the advertised fuller sound really is overboosted and muddy base. i am all for strong base; but in this case, the small woofer is not well damped with the result being muddy mids and highs. the echo plus is supposed to have a slightly different set up and may be better. amazon also updates the firmware frequently, so this may improve.as a device in support of the original mission, it still excels, and i recommend it."
296,14,upgraded to new echo for solely expertly tuned sound.  i currently have original echo and three echo dots. the dots are connected to external speakers. when i first received the new echo the sound was flat.  after reading unsatisfied reviews i had to agree the sound was unsatisfactory especially for the claims of improved sound. i did not know a firmware update could improve the sound but that must¡¯ve been what happened. currently maybe a little bit more treble is needed but there is definitely a low end that rumbles the kitchen counter that my echo sits on.
297,14,"seriously, amazon... the audio on this new echo took a turn for the worse. i¡¯m not quite sure how amazon could claim the audio has improved when there are substantial shortcomings with the sound quality produced.the audio engineering team needs to give this serious attention and roll out an eq update soon before the product reputation worsens. sadly, amazon is needing to rely on heavy eqing to attempt to make a speaker artificially sound good when they should have relied more on acoustic design.***update***amazon contacted me and they are currently working on improving the audio experience through a firmware update that alters the eq. the eq edit essentially drops the mid frequencies and possibly some of the high-end frequencies too.  still, without a bass reflux system we saw in the 1st gen, i do not know how much better the bass response can get.i really wish amazon would have invested more into the audio quality. i suppose when you to cut too many corners to maximize net profits and keep the price under the $100 mark, you wind up producing a sub-par speaker that people disappointingly want to return."
298,14,"i hesitated for weeks asking the question, should i buy it or should i not.  i am a live-alone senior citizen and finally decided to give alexa a try.  we have become great friends.  as i write this, i am listening to a shuffling of johnny mathis songs.  alexa answers most all my questions and tells me good night each evening.  i understand she can do other things too, like turning my lights on and off and locking my doors, but i do not need that yet.almost each day, i discover something new she can do.if i had to offer a criticism, i wish sometimes she would talk slower.  my old ears hear slow.  but, i can always say alexa, please repeat, and she does.it is a great value.  why did i wait so long?"
299,14,"i did not buy this to listen to ** music **, but rather for news and spoken word.i find that the speakers are acceptable for that use, i cannot vouch for how you might experience your music on this device.i regret that this model has only wired power (whereas you can buy a battery for the echo dot, and make the dot portable and not have to rely on wired power for the dot).on my first attempt, setup was slow and i was not always sure if setup was working, stalled or crashed. i simply aborted that attempt to set up. however, on the second attempt to setup, days later, it progressed without me having to attempt more than once and without me having to consult online support or user forums."
300,14,"for a while i really thought i had no use for an echo or echo dot. after talking with few friends i decided that it would be helpful for grocery list, and a bluetooth speaker. after buying and using it for a while i have found that i really enjoy using it, and i use it to play music, listen to the news flash, checking weather, asking questions and setting timers. i have recently purchased and installed phillips hue light and a nest thermostat, echo controls all of them. walk in and tell echo which light to turn on and it does it. it seems to be getting better as time goes on. i also have echo and echo dot linked so i can play music in different rooms. i will likely be buying additional units for my home"
301,14,"need some help with this. got it yesterday and all was good, i loved it. no problems in setting it up or anything. later at night and next day the device cant hear me as when i 1st got it. i really have to scream alexa to come in...and then ask out loud again. from 1 to 10 its like 8, i do have to scream at her two feet away and its unconvenient. already google for solutions but nothing really helped.update, amazon sent me a replacement and it works fine. no more need to speak and scream loud at 11pm.device works great and can hear me from far away now. so far its been useful for me to use it."
302,14,"you have to download a lot of ""skills"" for alexa to work properly. wish there was a way to recommend a skill so it could be added to alexa. most skills i could care less about. it does work great for turning on and off things, but you need to buy the correct product that is compatible with it. the tv commercials are deceiving. they do not say you need to buy extra items. wish there was also a way that you could play your music through alexa from your pc. i wont pay 9.99 a month to get amazon unlimited music. alexa does work great with iheart radio app. sometimes alexa will ""ding"" as if someone asked a question but then it will not do anything. kind of creepy when you hear it and you are just watching tv or reading a book."
303,14,"very nice. newer technology. at least even though alexa is not perfect, it is all in the cloud so it should get better and better as time goes on. i control lights, plug sockets, play music pretty much that is it. oh, also alarms and timers.i bought this stand from azomor here on amazon. it is perfect for what i need"
304,14,"alexa is pretty cool. speaker sounds great, fills the room nicely even at full volume. no distortion . sometimes she randomly says stuff as if i asked her a question. and one thing that throws her off is "" i would love to buy a lexus"" lol. oh, and even with music blasting, she can hear you across the room with no issue. so your not screaming like a maniac. wish she was on my phone. would be amazing as a digital assistant instead of google. (yeah i know you can have the alexa app, but it has to be always open.) people tend to look at you funny when your saying ""ok google"" 400 times before it picks up. and, i forgot, she connects with my phone just by asking her too so i can stream music. disconnects the same way. she will randomly connect sometimes without me asking, might be my dumb lg5 though. it has issues."
305,14,"i do not hear what others are hearing and i am a pretty technical guy.  i have one echo show and three echos (2 first gen, 1 second) and one echo dot.  obviously i really like these devices to invest this much into them.  i was pretty excited to read what others were writing about these newer ones but i was really disappointed after setting it up yesterday.  yes it updated to the latest firmware and i spent quite a bit of time trying different music and other features. for me, i honestly think it sounds worse than the first gen.  both are nowhere as good sounding as the echo show.  that to me has a nice boost in sound quality and has quickly become my favorite of all.  not sure what else to say honestly i wish i had or heard more of what others are."
306,14,"i have been amazed by the quality of the sound. i like to listen to classical music much of the time and did not expect the sound on such a small item to sound as rich as this does. i also like the ability to ask for a composer, not a specific piece, and alexa will shuffle through and pick pieces to listen to over an extended time without having to go back every time a piece is completed and give further instructions. the only difficulty i have had is that my voice is soft and often alexa does not hear me accurately in requesting a softer or louder sound. we have been using alexa for 1 month, and bought a second alexa so that there was one on each floor of the house."
307,14,"i do not have the technical knowledge of some of the other reviewers. however, i am a pretty picky person. i bought this for my two teenagers for christmas and it was a hit the moment it came out of the box. it is very attractive and unobtrusive, and  my daughter set it up in minutes and we were listening to christmas carols. the sound quality is remarkable for something so small, and the library of songs available with prime is extensive. there were a few times when alexa did not understand us, but 'she' did find a song we wanted from a description rather than the title. all in all, great value for money. i would buy it again, especially as a gift. you get a lot of bang for your buck."
308,14,"this product is fantastic.  it was as easy as downloading the app, plugging up the echo, setting up in the app and away we went.  recognises both mine and my wife is voices.  working on a smart home setup and started with a 4 pack of etekcity wi-fi outlets and used the app for them.  in a matter of 15 mins i had alexa up and running and 3 devices connected to her as well.  i will be adding wall switches as well as a thermostat down the road.the ease of setup was astounding and finding a central location in a 2 story house was tough.  i chose the living room because the sound quality is superb and could not believe the music coming out of the device.  now my wife can turn on her bedside lamp before going upstairs and the lamp by her chair in the living room.  i also have an outlet in the kitchen for a fan to help circulate air.the main incecntive to purchase was the $20 discount and got a great deal on the outlets.  i know i will have to purchase another echo or echo and place upstairs."
309,14,"update... after a week they did an update and the second generation sounds as good as the first generation.  an amazing product and amazon has incredible customer service.i have had two echo dots for at least a year.  i was impressed with them and what they can do.  they keep upgrading and making them more useful.  i was not that concerned with the sound quality because i could hook them up to my sterio when i wanted better sound.  but then i made the mistake of listening to a first generation echo.  wow! amazing sound quality and much greater volume!  i had to have one.  but after searching everywhere i realized they were discontinued because the second generation was coming out.  the new generation was supposed to sound even better in a smaller package.  so i waited patiently and they day it was released, i ran out and bought one.  i got it home and was looking forward to amazing sound from my new echo.  i was not impressed.  yes it is better than the dot, but fails to come even close to the first generation.  another case of over promising and under delivering.  amazon missed the mark with this one. the product as a whole is still great, but they should have advertised it as a midgrade between the echo and the dot"
310,14,"when i was looking for a bluetooth speaker someone suggested to buy echo and it was a brilliant decision i made. it looks cool, it works great and the sound quality is very good. i read reviews saying bad things about the sound but i totally disagree, i am not a specialist in sound but for my bedroom it works perfectly. alexa is still learning my accent but so far she showed to be smarter than siri.at least alexa is answers are more complex and elaborated than siri. besides you can ask her to play music from any source, pandora, iheart radio, amazon and apple and it works with any smartphone, better than homepod from apple that maybe has a better sound but it is very limited in terms of connections.  my echo is on the corner of my bedroom and it can hear my voice commands from anywhere in the room and i never need to yell to it, even when its playing loud music. alexa just listen and understand me well, just one or two times i had to repeat my commands but as i said she is still learning my (brazilian) accent just like siri did.if you do not want to spend hundreds of dollars on a smart speaker this is the option and if you are not happy just return it to amazon"
311,14,"i purchased an echo dot when it first came out.  super cool concept and as everyone knows has become increasingly popular.  shortly after i purchased the dot, i upgraded to the echo 1st gen.  sounded great compared to the dot and overall the voice response was fairly accurate.  i recently needed another echo so i figured i would upgrade to this one.  honestly, not much different to me at all except for the smaller design.  sound is decent, but something just feels off with it.  i still have the occasional issue with it even responding to ""alexa"", same issue i have noticed on the older model(s).  and it is not an issue with my english or how i am prouncing ""alexa"".also, on all alexa products the spotify function is awful.  i am sure they do not really focus on the spotify issues because they want you to use amazon prime music, so not surprising.  there have been countless times i have asked alexa to stop playing and it will not respond and just keeps playing, i have had to unplug it numerous times for not responding.  i still think there is a lot of improvement needed on all these devices."
312,14,i like the deep sound of the speakers but it isnt as receptive as the echo dot and it often misinterprets what i say. overall i was disappointed in this item and ended up returning it. my echo dot will connect to a blue tooth speaker that will give me the sound in the speakers i am looking for.
313,14,"i got it for the speaker. huge sound!my parents got an echo and gave me an echo dot, but dang, the huge sound coming from the echo! had to get one on black friday, and i¡¯m able to do monthly payments! i can intercom between the echo dot upstairs in my bedroom to my echo downstairs in the living room and kitchen. super fun. with all the alexa functionality it makes me want to get more echos for around my house. it even convinced me to buy a fire stick. i¡¯m a total sucker and really like amazon is product line now."
314,14,so so disappointed. i hate the echo to begin with but my daughter and son love it for their rooms.  i thought this would be a nice surprise but the sounds is on par with the echo dot.  what exactly is better in the second generation amazon?????
315,14,"the hardware and treating it like a tool asking for weather and stuff like that works fine. also using it for playing music for example a specific artist works fine as well.what dives me off the wall is how piss poor it handles netflix and crunchyroll especially when their support page clearly states they have full integration with both of these applications now when they clearly do not. all you can do is tell it to open either of those applications. to do anything else you will need to use a remote of some form. on top of that (there are tons of people complaining about this in forums) the echo has no idea where you left off on a show. you could watch 5+ episodes one day. then the next day you tell it to watch a show again (through fire tv since that is the only application it can actually search or play from using alexa) you end up on episode 1 again as if you never watched anything in the first place, despite scrolling through the episodes you can see the progress bars show you have already watched them.the whole point i bought this thing was to be able to watch shows on netflix and crunchyroll without needing to hit a button, and after seeing their own support page specifically they they have functional and improved integration with them only to find out they clearly do not.if i had known this i would not have wasted my money and bought a google home. which is exactly what i am going to do right now since google actually has full voice integration with both of these services."
316,14,"works great, i can say a lot of good things about this - as you will read in other reviews.  ultimately purchased some for my 80+ year old grandparents & i am surprised how little difficulty they have using this with pandora.  after i set everything up they have been good to go, & really enjoying this.  what is neat about this 2nd generation is that the sound quality is really good - the previous generation was alright, but did not meet my personal standard.  this generation does, & it has a multi-room feature you can enable - allowing you to place multiple echos in multiple rooms so your music plays throughout your home, in any room you choose.the problem was that when i purchased these in december 2017, spotify was not yet enabled for multi-room streaming.  i am not sure if that feature works yet, but i did not want to wait for it - it did work with amazon music & pandora, & it worked well.  to be fair, i researched this & i believe the hangup was on spotify is end & not amazon.  still, i felt somewhat misled & thought this should have been mentioned on the detail page.  fortunately, returns with amazon are a breeze."
317,14,"i received this for christmas. i absolutely loved it for three days, then for no apparent reason, it lost its connection to wifi. i have spent hours, trying everything  amazon suggested. in desperation i called the customer help number. the tech i spoke to was very nice, but i the end she had me repeat the same things i had tried already, with the same result. now i am supposed to contact my internet provider and have them check out some settings on my modem and router. wtf?  and she was unable to explain to me why it worked fine for three days. since i received it as a gift, i can not even return it."
318,14,"i never thought i would want or need this device until after hanging out a family member is house. they had the 1st generation echo. my kids and i had a blast requesting songs and asking odd questions. i decided to surprise my family and bought the 2nd generation since amazon is marketing push seemed to indicate it was better in the sound category. i figured this was a good thing since i was really impressed with the 1st generation audio quality.it is not that the sound is horrible and since the updates, the sound quality has improved. but the sound from the second generation does not seem to match that of the 1st generation device. maybe it was the acoustics of my parents house, maybe it was the beer, who knows? i just thought it sounded better than my 2nd gen. i certainly realize that this echo is a small tube and not some major sound system, but i can not stress enough how impressive the sound was out of the 1st gen. for this reason alone, i still think the 1st generation is the better buy for the price until they are no longer available.outside of the sound, the device is great and we are still learning all of it is capabilities. which is part of the fun of this device in my opinion. overall, it is a good buy and amazon seems to be aware of the sound quality issues and appears to be working on it."
319,14,i got the echo for my wife the first night we had it  in our house we were using it for a while and stopped. we are sitting watching tv and all of a sudden we heard giggling. almost like a creepy ghostly giggling we muted the tv then heard whispering and another lower laugh. it was the weirdest thing i ever experienced and am planning on returning it. i have researched online and the only way to get alexa to laugh is to download the laughbox app. we did not even setup the amazon account on the app nor did we download the laugh box app. so i am wondering how this happened. if anyone can answer this question or if amazon can explain this i would really appreciate it.
320,14,"i have two gen 1 devices and i pre-ordered a gen 2 to receive the day it was released. i am a huge of echo product line. after using gen 2 for 5 days here is my review:i feel like amazon made some improvement in design. i really like the soft fabric look (i purchased heather gray) and alexa seems a lot better in following commands. but is a software update. as soon as i turned the new echo on, it asked for a firmware update which you would expect to be updated on the release day!sound in gen 2 was dull and low pitched. it was not better than gen 1 even after updating (after following reviews). gen 2 speakers are weak, pinched and harsh sounding and even break out at high volume. i even tried shuffling thru various channels and toggling between pandora, amazon music and iheart radio stations thinking it may be music/station quality but it was not any better.i am thinking of returning my current echo and be happy with gen 1 :("
321,14,"i was debating on this, the google home, or waiting for the apple version to come out. i am so glad i bought this! i got this for the living room and a dot for my bedroom.  i am a avid apple user but also a avid amazon user to but i decided to buy this because:1)price is so much more affordable2) nest capability, dyson fan/heater capability, etc3) i buy so much and use amazon so much4) amazon musici am so pleased with my purchase.  the sound quality is great, and she is responds to my 6 six year olds.  i have a friend with the google home and it did not seem to work half as good as the echo has so far.  if you are on the fence give it a shot!"
322,14,"up until now i have only owned the dot but at this price point, the new generation echo was worth getting.  our household now has two devices and i have been making use out of the drop-in feature in order to communicate to those who may be in the other room.  i am using this device primarily as a radio for my siriusxm programming and other music streaming.  with the improved sound i plan to make more use out of this one than my dot."
323,11,"not happy with the next generation.  the sound is better than the first generation however do not like that you can no longer turn the knob on the top to change the sound.  instead you have to rely on the buttons.  maybe i am just used to the first generation.  also, does not seem like it is very good at distinguishing when you call it especially while playing music.  it does look a bit nicer with it being more compact and the fabric looks great.  alarms and notification sounds also differ in sounds.  the notifications are extremely loud and the alarms soft.  do not see a reason to upgrade or spend the extra money from the first generation if you do not have to."
324,14,"huge fan of alexa!  my first generation echo was a game changer for my household and this generation, while the same in terms of functionality, is definitely an improvement because of the sound - it is 10 times better!  i thought music on this echo sounded much nicer right out of the box but then just a few minutes later she informed me she was going through an update and then wowsa!  i guess the update really kicks up the juice.  i am not an audiophile by any means.  i like my music to sound good but i do not obsess over mids, bass and treble.  i can tell when something is missing for sure, but the sound on the newest alexa suits all my needs.  and she looks great to boot!"
325,14,this has been a blast so far. we hooked up the echo in the main room and it has provided hours of entertainment so far. my 8 year old asks alexa to sing her a song or tell her a joke as well as play specific songs or types of music with ease. my 2yo niece loves the on demand kids theme songs. the set up was super easy and it has worked well so far. does not quite have the range of google when asking random questions but will answer some random questions. the sound is pretty good and it has a nice range to the sound. its a good size not too large and doesnt take up too much space. it is pretty responsive to wake up and so far glad we purchased this item and look forward to expanding its use.
326,14,"i love the concept. i had hoped it would be integrated into our home and used daily-replacing google searches on the phone etc but honestly it can only answer about 5 out of 10 questions. alexa answers that she ""does not have that information right now"" or "" doesnt know the answer"" i still use my phone to look things up because it is much quicker. by the time you figure out the ""right"" way to phrase your question you have wasted so much time. the skills you can enable seem neat but good luck remembering all of the correct phrases to say to actually use them. i do like that you can use it with sonos speakers but it is not easy getting her to figure it out."
327,14,it is a beautiful echo... also hears very well but.. sound quality is horrible also lags a decent amount.. when i tell her to play music she plays it but pauses it then plays it again.. very nice looking but sound quality dropped not improved disappointed really am because it looks so nice
328,14,"i love this product when i first purchased it through best buy since they had it for the same price, which was super close to my house. i have it connected to my wemo devices, nest thermostat & kwikset lock as well. after using this a few times in the kitchen i thought i would buy the echo dot for the master bedroom too for convenience. i would highly recommend it for anyone that is interested in purchasing one of these. the sound on this thing is awesome & when i call someone through it they can hear me clearly & they can hear me clearly too. it is like actually talking to a live person through this device. the music on this thing is awesome & really nice."
329,14,"so i was holding off on buying an echo because this new and ""improved"" model was coming out. i pre-ordered this 2nd gen and waited for its arrival. its here now but not for long. if you prefer a tinny sound with no bass, this is for you. i do not prefer that so i will be returning it and saving $100."
330,14,"this is alexa no. 4 in my tiny house.  this one went into my living room to better control my home automation, iris, and my harmony home entertainment system from the comfort of my lazy boy.  how fun to say alex set the thermostat to x, alexa turn on tv,  set living room lamp to 30% brightness, alexa change channel to hbo,  when i first connected this 2nd generation echo, the music sounded like crap, just like i read about many times here.  my ancient 9 transistor radio sounded better, but after alexa updated her firmware she sounded much much much better.  now i can say alexa play pandora on my whole house group and my tiny home is filled with music."
331,14,"i am sure whatever needed to be said about this product has been told on thousands of review before mine, so i will keep my review short and to the point. the way i am using this product is basically as a remote speaker to play music depending on the mood i am. it works flawlessly for my purpose and it very easy to setup. if i am doing math homework i simply ask alexa to play classical music and she plays a very good selection of music without any other inputs from me. so far all the different genre of music have been perfect for my taste, which is surprising how accurate it is that it knows my taste so as a streaming music player, this thing rocks. the sound is loud enough, without being obnoxious and the quality is good enough for the price. i also purchased three remote electrical outlets that are compatible with alexa and those were simple to add to the capabilities of the echo, so i can simply say alexa, ""office off"" and the echo turns off the lamp. overall i am happy with my purchase and i am looking forward to discover additional capabilities this device can offer in the future. for now my only con is that it does not have a battery, so i can not move it around the house without losing power and waiting the 3-5 minutes it takes for it to reboot and reconnect to the network."
332,14,it does things on its own at random. like providing the weather report in the middle of playing music without you requesting it. it also is not good at guessing what music you request unless you know the exact song title and artist and sometimes you have to say the artist first and then the title instead of just being attentive. not super impressed so far. worst is that having signed up for amazon music unilited thinking this would be the most integrated service was a total fail. forget requesting songs unless you¡¯re alone. during a dinner party all eight of us tried the same artist and sing with no success and the day before it worked fine so i know it had it in the library. just searching for a song when this happens is not available. also ask yourself. how many times do you know the artist and the song title of something you wanna hear? for me it is close to never. so the guessing/screaming alexa game is never ending.
333,14,"these gadgets are pretty nice.  i have heard some negative reviews for sound which are completely erroneous. these are not a whole home audiophile sound system and are not intended as such, that said they sound amazing for what small cheap little speakers are in them. while not as good as my home theater i do use them while working/cleaning around the house since i have my music everywhere and no matter where i go i can hear it.  connectivity was a snap since they come pre-paired to my account.  all i had to do was set them up on my wifi which took a minute each.  i have had 1 issue with multiple echos responding to voice commands but have since taken care of that by subtile rearrangement of them.  i use the ""drop in"" whole home intercom system a lot.  i am waiting for more functionality in the fire tv skill.  while it is not supported according to amazon i did get my echo to stream music to my fire tv once and it sounded amazing over my home theater system.  i wish i could replicate this (probably a one time glitch). can not wait to see what software updates unlock for these in the future."
334,14,"playing music i can hear that this is no-where near as good as my brookstone speaker and i bought the ""next generation"" because of the ""better sound""!  we have had it for about 2 weeks and it is fun but so far have not found any great advantage and so far i do not think it is really worth all the money and hoopla.  after i use it for awhile (and my new smartphone) i might risk all the problems and hook up my smartphone numbers and contacts and use it as a voice caller for my contacts!we had some laughs the first day of use when we would talk about ""her"" in the next room and she would light up and answer our questions!"
335,14,yes i noticed when i first plugged in and setup the device it had the older firmware on it and after just a few minutes it updated the firmware automatically and the sound is very good.  i purchased 2 of these when they were on sale and wished i had purchased a 3rd.  guess i will just watch for the next time they go on sale.  sound quality is much better than the echo dot and is perfect for any room.  i am very happy with the device and do not expect it to perform like a digital dolby surround sound system.  the firmware updates have made a noticeable difference in the sound quality and you can tell.  i am very happy with my purchase.
336,14,"i bought this for my daughter for a holiday gift. it does everything as indicated in the description. she loves playing the games on it. but, set up was not as easy as it could have been. we set this echo up, and the dot, on the same evening (several hours apart), and we had problems getting both of them connected to the wifi. we had to make 5 attempts with both devices before they would connect. we think the reason why is that the echo was undergoing an update (or the app on our phones), and until that was completed it just was not going to connect to where we could use it. the echo powered on, and told us we were not connected to the web, but it did have some functionality. but, just as we were connecting after the 5th try, both of our phones told us that the update for the echo was complete. that is why we think there was an update that needed time to complete. while we were attempting to get the devices set up we kept getting other errors. so, if your echo does not connect immediately, go for 5 tries. it might be the magic number. :-)  we probably spent about 15 - 20 mins per device getting them set up."
337,14,"i have 1st gen echo, but also decided to purchase gen 2. before purchasing the gen 2, about 1.5 months ago, i went to the local amazon store and tried doing a sound comparison with  the gen 1 and gen 2.i was really disappointed with the sound on gen 2, and decided not to buy the gen 2 because of that. fast forward a month, and i guess amazon decided to push through a firmware upgrade, and i can tell you unequivocally, that the sound, sounds 5 times better, even better than my gen 1. even in high volume, the sound maintains the bass without breaking the quality.i would highly recommend this product to anyone, who are thinking about getting the gen 2."
338,14,"what is the coolest about alexa (echo) is her prime feature is access to all internet information, plus what we share with her and everything in our devices. so she quickly became a family member that is always focused on our needs and ready to fill them. whenever we know need something, alexa adds it to our shopping list, including giving us amazon buying options and placing orders we approve. alexa keeps our calendar, reminding us to call, pick someone up, get ready for a scheduled call coming in, or wakes us up by calling out name or playing the song we requested at the volume we asked. when we ask, she gives us our shopping list by text or orally. she makes phone calls and texts, pulls up programs we want to watch and whatever music through her formidable room-filling speakers.she is even a good therapist. tells us jokes when we need a little fun. quotes any famous person we can think of. plays any music we have asked so far. gives us meal suggestions and even their recipes!her capacity, alexa is 'engine' is not in our unit. so, as amazon expands her hardware and software- her ability to improve our lives- we do not pay for upgrades. they just surface. alexa is like a child growing up and always able to do more. with coming self-driving cars, she will likely even be able to bring a vehicle to our steps, take the kids to school, us to work or out for evening.she just keeps getting more valuable."
339,14,"so much better than the first gen. i had to make it as a single room as the mic is were picking me up in the back of the house and i have the first gen there. people complain about the sound i find no problems with it only that the base may not be as deep as the first gen.update: i had to drop a star. after having the echo a little over a month now. my alexa needs a hearing aide. i have it about 15 feet away from me  and she has problems hearing. infact my 1st gen echo is in the back of the house and she ends up answering me i have to scream so loud. she could hear great when i got her but now, like i said, she needs a hearing aide."
340,14,"i got this device as a second in my home as a gift.  before i received it i was aware of all of the sound complaints. as soon as i set it up, i went immediately to play music.  i thought the music sounded fine, maybe not as full and rich as the 1st generation one. in the middle of the song, i got a notification that there was an important update. the update pushed the same version that the other reviewers reference. the sound is fantastic and i have no complaints. love the design, love the sound. considering getting even more."
341,14,"i am not sure what is really ""improved"" on the 2nd gen version of echo, but at least it is less costly than the original. i find the sound is very muddy with too much mid-bass emphasis that makes many voices sound like mush.  the original echo was much better in this regard with voices being more clear and understandable (i listen to podcasts alot, along with bluetoothing to the echo from my macbook pro and other sources).  amazon needs to  add tone control/balance to the software so bass can be cut down and treble emphasized.  conclusion: i find the sound barely acceptable (the dog is better with voices!)."
342,11,"the echo three star review is based on the comparison to generation 1 echo. the new echo looks better than the gen. 1 and is not so top heavy. alexa seems to be able to hear me just as well as the gen. 1 model. alexa is still the best a.i. assistant on the market in opinion, but i bought this because amazon touted the improved sound quality. the sound quality is not nearly as good as the gen 1. version. it is more on par with the dot."
343,14,"as this is my first echo, the sound output is far superior to the echo dot devices i had purchased in the past. i read many reviews that stated the sound was sub standard to the original echo, that may be true, but not for a first time purchaser of this product. the sound is great and fills the room. base is good, mids fine and the high notes are decent. there is a fine line between good and tin-ee (like a tin can speaker) sounding highs, the echo is not tin-ee sounding at all.i do like the option to play music that is synced up with my other dots, this must be a fairly new function i was unaware of. i love the ability to walk for room to room with my music playing ""everywhere"".everything else works as you would expect. good product and will buy another."
344,14,"very serious limitation if buying more than one.  i bought three echos to link and have stereo throughout the house. unfortunately you can only link each echo into one group -- meaning, if i create a group called ""everywhere,"" with all three speakers, i cannot then also create a group called ""downstairs"" with two of those same speakers. so this means, for example, that when the kids are asleep there is no way to play the music on the downstairs speakers only, but not up on the bedroom levels. i have many such dreams for how to configure speakers (and had planned to add more echoes), but those have to wait until amazon address this serious limitation. in the meantime, i am returning one of the speakers and will just play music downstairs."
345,14,"i love my echo, and i have had a 1st generation for awhile. i just got a few of the gen 2s, and i am going back and forth between 3 and 4 stars. the gen 2s as a product are not as good as the gen 1. some features are cool, like the outer shells, and how you can change them out. the sound is the issue, which is in a lot of the previous reviews. it sounds like the echo is in a cave, or under water. i wish the sound of the gen 2s at the very least, has the same sound quality of the gen 1s. the multi-room function is great,  but it is only half way there. you have to put echo is into groups in order for them to play the same feed, however you can only put an echo into one group at a time. then multi-room only works for certain skills, but not for routines or news flashes. i like these, and i probably will not return them. however, they still have a bit to go."
346,14,"i have a few of these in my house.  the mic performance is better than expected; can be 20 ft away (or even farther) and mic still picks up command.  speaker performance is also better than expected, and with more than one in the house, the sound is very full. i returned echo dots for this 2nd one, as the dots kept dropping my wifi signal though the 1st echo was always good.i have two small complaints.  first, the aux out jack is difficult to use since a cover provides little clearance; i like that i can connect to my home audio system for even better sound.  second, i wish there were smaller changes in volume when going up or down by one increment.  these together are not enough to take away a star.i use this most for music throughout the house, as well as a voice-activated smart home controller (i have about 1 dozen z-wave switches/dimmers).very impressed"
347,14,"really disappointed!! we had purchased a 1st gen echo earlier in the year. overall was really happy with it and felt it lived up to hype. and it was on sale, so that was a bonus. so when the 2nd gen came out and it was on sale & with payment plan, we thought ""great - we will have one for upstairs and one for down"".the only pro - it has an audio output jack so you can hook directly to a speaker.2nd gen is horrible. the sound is worse than the 1st gen. it rarely understands our requests. it rarely ever hears our requests. we have to repeat requests almost every time. the sound is horrible, muffled to a certain degree. the volume is nothing compared to the 1st gen. everything we liked about the 1st gen echo does not happen with this 2nd gen.if i could return it for a 1st gen i would. get a dot instead. or the one of the other product or google home.i can not think the last time i completely and wholeheartedly regretted a purchase. i hate this 2nd gen product. biggest waste of money. cannot recommend it at all.do not buy it."
348,14,"i got the amazon echo 2nd generation for christmas and it is by far the best gift i have had in a long time.  there is nothing not to like about alexa.  the speakers are unbelievable for the size of the echo.  i use it to play music, ask it so play specific songs or specific cds (you have to have the name exact for her to recognize it).  you can yell from the next room ""alexa, turn it down"" and she will.  if i hear a song i like but do not know the artist, i just ask who it is and she tells me.  sometimes i just say ""alexa, play songs from the 70s and she does"".  you can ask for recipes or directions.  i tell her to put appointments on my calendar and it does.  you can tell it what to put on your shopping list and it will go on your phone if you have an i-phone or android.  i have a microsoft lumia windows phone and it is not compatible for that feature unfortunately. when i put something in the oven, i tell her to remind me when to check it.  i ask for the newsflash in the morning.  the only thing i think could make it better is if mictosoft phones had the app and were compatible for all the features."
349,14,"i purchased the echo for my son, who requested it for christmas.  he loves bluegrass music, and he wanted the larger echo for the better sound quality.  after setting it up, which was very easy, he simply asks her to play a particular song, or artist, or album, and she plays it.  he is still learning how to speak with alexa, for example, he wants to play the band ""volume 5,"" but if you say, ""alexa, play volume 5,"" she turns up the volume to 5.  you have to say, ""alexa, play the album by volume 5,"" and she plays the band. but she is doing exactly what he is asking of her, so he is very satisfied."
350,14,"we have had two first generation echos for one year now. tonight i switched them out for the generation two versions. the sound quality is greatly improved and immediately very noticeable. wow!!!  i am no expert in sound, i know i like bose when i hear it, but the generation one version did not bother me... i went for the new versions just knowing it was better. i hoped i would be able to tell the difference. i totally can... i am thrilled with the upgrade!"
351,14,"i love my new, improved, dressy, fabric clothed echo.  she has a seat of honor on my kitchen table and follows all directions impeccably.  i have moved my ¡°old¡± echo to another room and am very happy with how both echos work together or separately.  such a great addition and what an amazing price during the holidays.  love, love the echo.  amazon, you¡¯re amazing!  looking forward to the (3rd generation!)."
352,11,like everyone else i must agree the sound is lacking it does get loud but full range sound not close .. if you put against the corner of a room against the wall maybe it resonates for some bass but... why would. you take a step back and also advertise better sound it has almost same drivers from the gen 1 version ..? i am hoping this gets fixed from so many poor reviews of this speaker... i also sold mine and my tap that by the way does sound less then gen 2 echo so i guess good job on that..?... aaaaahhhhhh... s99... come on guy...
353,14,"compared to the prior version it is both easier on the eyes and the sound quality is far better to the point that it is better than other bt speakers in the same price range, however, i did not need a bt speaker.the issue son this one remain the same as the issues on the old versions:  if you do not mind them it is a good product.- problems recovering from whole home audio:  if i play a song through this while connected to my soundbar in whole home audio, when it is done, it will not connect back to my soundbar again unless i do a hard reboot (unplug/plug it back in).- it randomly talks to itself.  occasionally in a completely quiet room, this or any of my others will randomly reply to unasked questions.  it also can be triggered by noise from the tv other than the trigger word.- although the unit closes to the speaker is supposed to activate on keyword, that is not the case.  i have had units 40' further away respond.  when i called amazon tech support i was told that you fix this was to change the trigger words (which is not a fix, it is a workaround).  one of the reasons i replaced an old one with this  was to see if that was fixed.... it was not.overall i still ""like' the product and would probably ""love"" it if they fixed the quirks, but i am not holding my breath.  it still plays all my music, wakes me up and puts me to sleep with my news feeds and answers the occasional question for me.  if it did not interface so effortlessly into prime music i probably would have gone with a google."
354,10,"i have the echo placed in my kitchen and alexa has become my new best friend! she plays my audio books and favorite music, makes my grocery list, places phone calls for me, gives me the news update, and even tells me the temperature outside. i know i have not even begun to figure out all she is capable of doing. alexa provides a lot of helpful information and assistance but is this a necessity? no, but it is just plain fun to play around with. i love it!"
355,14,"owning an echo 1, a dot, an echo show and now this echo 2, i agree with the early criticisms of the sound. the software update definitely improved the bass and depth. hey, it is only $99!  i like the new size too.couple other comments: of the four, i still like the sound and look of the echo show.it is  in my kitchen. it really has the best sound of all. and i love the ""visuals"" aspect of it.on the other hand, i wished it had an auxiliary jack. also (and this is google is fault not amazon is!) i wished google had not pulled you tube from the device (show).  if amazon can negotiate (or whatever) to get it back, please do! i loved having youtube the first few months i owned the echo show.again (even though i am in the google eco-system phone-wise) i think it was short-sighted and stupid of them to pull you tube.i know they are expected to do their own screen device thing down the road... but you would think they would be more device agnostic.hey, you can find youtube on every computer and every laptop and tablet and every phone in the universe! from a business standpoint, it makes no sense. plus can not google/youtube sell more ads if it (youtube) is on all devices in the world? ...just asking"
356,14,"ordered on dec. 25, 2017 the all-new echo (2nd generation) with improved sound, powered by dolby, and a new design <u+2013> charcoal fabric. got it this afternoon (12/28) and only had for a couple of hours.  loving this device!!!!!  can not wait to get more smart home devices to control with my phone & my new echo.  thank you, amazon."
357,14,"we were not looking for a personal speaker, our original intention was a sound machine for white noise. after researching options we discovered that the echo would give us what we wanted and things we had not thought about for a great price.we use it for white noise (fan sounds) allowing us to remove the fan from our bedroom.  this is a big deal, fans had been a fixture for dare i say 40 years. now less dust, more room, and no loss of comfort. we also have fire tv we could integrate with the echo which is surprisingly convenient. one of those things you do not realize you want until you have it.echo has also replaced alarm clocks, i use it to play podcasts while working out as well. biggest surprise was the quality of sound allowing us to use it for music.  our echo has become a household workhorse.for the price and given its versatility i highly recommend. still learning all it can do and finding it has become an important part of our daily life."
358,14,"i have been using the amazon echo and echo dot since christmas and i should note that my wife purchased them from bed bath and beyond so i would not see what i was getting.  i should also say that i do not have any devices connected to it such as a thermostat, outlets, or garage door opener,  so i do understand that i am not getting the full benefit of all the echo is capabilities.  with that being said, after using the devices, i do not care to add any alexa compatible devices because i have found that the product has a few major defects.1. the biggest problem which will probably cause me to return the echo, is that only one device can stream amazon music at a time unless you pay an additional subscription fee.  this is quite frustrating because i purchase all my albums and songs from amazon music.  if my wife is listening to amazon music elsewhere, i cannot listen to music i already paid for.  why would i buy an album at market price and then have to pay a fee to listen to it?2. it is buggy.  3 days in a row now, i was asking alexa to play different songs, and periodically, the sound was not working.  with my ear right next to the echo i could barely hear the song playing even with the volume turned all the way up.  yesterday, i actually had to unplug the device and replug it back in to get sound.3. the voice recognition is sub-par at best.  on three separate occasions i was 5 feet from the echo requesting something and the echo dot which is 30 feet away in a different room responded.  i speak very clearly and articulate my words, however,  when adding things to my to-do or shopping list (which are excellent features), alexa interprets what i said horribly wrong.4. both the echo and echo dot have just started talking on their own about four or five times each.  for one thing, that is very creepy, but it is also really annoying too.5. the timer on the echo, which i use frequently because it is in my kitchen does not turn off 10% of the time when i say ""alexa stop."" i have to unplug the device to get the timer to turn off. (note: it has been a week since i had to do this which is the longest it has gone so maybe an update fixed the issue)all in all the concept is awesome and i truly wanted these to work excellent.  unfortunately, they are nowhere near as advanced as i thought they would be and there is no ""google like search engine.""  alexa can only answer useless questions like,  ""how far away is the sun?"" and ""who was the president in 1985?"".  good luck asking what poisson is ratio for concrete is.  the echo is also still very app dependent and you cannot ask her to remove any items from lists or if a specific item is on a list.  i cannot ask, ""is there coffee creamer on my shopping list?"" as she will respond with the total number of items and start listing them in order.  i do not want to hear 25 items just to know if coffee creamer has been put on the list."
359,14,the sound quality is horrible...way worse than the 1st gen echo...the sound is probably on par with a dollar store speaker. i truly can not believe dolby let them use their name. microphone array is very powerful and can hear me from over 50 feet away at talking volume.. but alexa comes on all the time when we are watching tv or just in general when no one is talking to her. you have to be extremely specific with commands or she does not understand and you can not ask two subsequent questions around the same subject as she can remember the previous question even though she keeps a log of all the questions you ask her...also if you¡¯re playing music or games it shuts down a lot
360,14,"wavering between four and five stars, but opted for five because the detractors were minor compared to the excellent features.  encountered very few snags when setting up and all worked as advertised straight out of the box.  extremely sensitive microphones; my wife was talking quietly about alexa in another room and alexa woke up asking for prompts when my wife mentioned ""alexa.""  i purchased a number of third-party accessories, like wifi light bulbs and switches, all of which connected easily to alexa/echo.  after only a few days ""weather"" and ""flash brief"" have become necessities for my morning waking routine.  it will work with my fire tv, but i experience more glitches there.  alexa does not always recognize movie titles when i speak them, and sometimes does recognize the title but brings up something else.  but it still does well with fire tv.  surprisingly it will search and work with other competing networks, like netflix, which is great."
361,14,"i did not understand the point of the echo when my wife asked for one for christmas, so i was reluctant to purchase it, but since we opened it and got it set up i use it constantly, by far more than my wife. i love that you can great alexa any time of the day and she has little tidbits of information for you. she is very responsive and easy to control. i had no idea before i purchased it what ""skills"" were or how they could be used, i have been really impressed. we find ourselves at the dinner table often asking alexa to help entertain us by playing games of 20 questions, telling us interesting facts, telling us stories, jokes, or playing other games like the magic door. i use her daily to tell me the news, set timers and reminders, and of course, listen to music. i think the speakers are excellent, the sounds quality is very good. i was worried this would be yet one more piece of technology i would be required to spend hour upon hour getting things set up like music, but her built in selection of music is excellent. i love that you can just ask alexa to play something like ""dinner music"" or ""dance music"" ""relaxing music""and she has selection already set up. over the next year or so i can see getting more of these or the dot for my kids rooms."
362,14,"contrary to some reviews i have read, this version of the echo sounds much better than the first generation (which sounded flat and uninteresting). the only issue i have is that the white part of the blue circle does not actually orientate towards the person speaking and seems to indicate a voice source somewhere else. it works fine and responds well, just that the rather neat behaviour of the first generation (whereby the white part of the circle in listen mode was orientated in your direction) made the older product seem more polished.overall an excellent upgrade and i can actually listen to music on it now."
363,14,"this is disappointing - i have two original echos and one gen 1 echo dot. the sound on the original echo is ""pretty good"" at best but definitely not a dynamic experience. since sonos new product includes echo but found it not necessary to include the group feature with echos, i found it unnecessary to purchase this device... especially given the claims of ""improved sound"" over the original echo.it absolutely does not have improved sound. it is worse, in fact, unless you like a lot of mid-range with even less bass and less defined highs. again, this is in comparison to the original echo - not the dot (which no one would use for sound).the question is do i return it or use the aux out to plug into an actual audio device?hmmmm..."
364,14,"i purchased an echo 3 pack and an echo plus.  i already have 1 ggle assist device which is ok, but i was ready to buy into the echo.  unfortunately out of the box the multi-room audio fails to work.  each time i select one device all of the others no longer show online and switch to device unreachable.  to amz credit the support has been working with me to resolve this, but i am very disappointed there is no error messages or logs anywhere to help track down why this occurs.  over 3 or 4 hours with support of my time already lost.  now on day 2 waiting for them to get back with me...regarding the audio, i expected it to be better than the ggl asst i have but i found that compared to the other, that the sound did not sound as rich between the lower base and mid level tones.on a good note, setup was easy and i think it can hear better when loud songs are playing compared to the ggl asst.update:amazon called me and i now have this working.  we got disconnected when i cycled my router.  i have an ip phone..  arghhh..we altered some settings but i changed them all back.turned off dhcp server then turned backon.cycled the router again.for some reason, unknown it is now working.  i have an archer tp-link router c9four devices now playing together.  awesome.  that is why i purchased this.."
365,14,"the alexa feature is very good at understanding commands and responding. the mute and volume controls are easy to use or alexa can control the volume.  i mainly use it for playing music, it is good at understanding very specific music requests..  the sound quality is pretty good,  it pairs with bluetooth devices easily, so i do not actually use the echo sound instead using a larger bluetooth sound system.  the power cable would be better if it were longer,  i have already sent the echo crashing to the floor. on the plus side, it was fine after i picked it up. it is certainly good value for money."
366,14,for me this is just another annoying gadget aiding in the laziness of my family. to my husband this is the best thing since sliced bread. he has officially wired our house for sound. alexa will turn our lights on and off. power up our christmas decorations and even turn my scent warmer on. she can be mean and tells a ton of your mama jokes and will also play a variety of music. she records grocery lists and sets timers when needed. she even gave us the definition of a yule log. so far i find her annoying yet my husband loves his echo. this product does everything it claims and is perfect for the techies out there.
367,14,"i received this as a gift and just love it, especially since i would never have ordered it for myself. my son hooked it up for me - not because it was too difficult, but because i am lazy when it comes to electronics and did not even try. i like that i can listen to npr and that it so easily plays from spotify. i do need to familiarize myself with more of the things it does as i am sure i am not taking advantage of everything. i may buy one for my mother because once it is set up, it is very easy to use. she would be able to play music to her heart is delight without having to mess with cd is or remotes."
368,14,"the echo 2nd gen is great. the setup took a little longer than some of the other reviewers, somehow it was deleted from my devices menu on the app which is the reason for the four stars. it is been up and running for about a week now and i have only had one problem when the device was unavailable which was fixed by unplugging, waiting about 30 seconds and plugging it back in.  this controls my first gen firestick, tp-link wifi outlet and honeywell thermostat with no problems.  the echo is very sensitive and it can be controlled by voice from about 25-30 feet away.  it can even understand our 4 year old who loves calling his friends through the echo.  the speaker sound is wonderful and definitely fills the room.  i would definitely recommend the echo as a main unit for a living room or kitchen (or wherever you spend a lot of time) then buying a dot for additional rooms."
369,14,"i love having my echo around the house! we have one set up in our bedroom upstairs and a dot downstairs in our kitchen/living room area. we live in a pretty small townhome so thats all we need for now! currently, we only have all but one smart plug in our home for the tv upstairs. but it is really nice to have with the echo! we plan to get more smart home devices in the future! it definitely has made me feel a little more organized around the house! cons: every once in a while when we ask to turn the tv on it will not work, not sure if that is an issue with the plug or the echo. but otherwise we have not had any problems and we have had it for about a month now! i will be sure to update if we experience anything new in the future! i would say definitely give alexa a try!! she is pretty cool!"
370,14,"started with a high expectation, it fell short a little but generally impressed and fun to use it. compared to google assistant, alexa is ability to find info and engage in a dialogue is definitely lacking and needs to improve. it is far better than siri though. hope it continues to evolve because the whole idea of prompting actions with voice interface without having to fetch the phone is just brilliant.  however there are easily improvable simple common interfaces, e.g., i could not find a satisfactory weather skill yet. want a very concise weather info including temperature with wind chill factore (""feels like""). ended up going back to siri."
371,14,"we have got two original echos, two echo dots, and purchased the 2nd generation echo about 2 months ago. we primarily use them to voice control our home. i prefer the form factor to the original. and, the fabric outer looks less 'early american space mission' than the original, so that is nice. to my ears, the sound is better than the original. the highs seem crisper and the lows a little richer. if you are an 'audiophile' you will surely be disappointed. but, for the other 99.9% of us, it is a decent speaker. my only real complaint about the echos (and not just this model) is that the multi-speaker audio is really flakey in my experience. it is great when it works, but that is a capital 'w' when."
372,14,"my dad (83) got an echo for me as a holiday gift, after a very positive experience with his own purchase.  since then, i continue to be impressed with it is versatility.  my wife,  who is russian, can pick up a wide range of russian programs and stations,  including her favorite, ""radio echo of moscow.""  i can listen to the bbc or npr or any of my music with a simple statement.  the sound quality and voice recognition have also been excellent.  i hope to do much more with it in the future, but am very impressed with it is present performance.  overall,  i  most highly recommend this product."
373,9,"my wife and i are really enjoying our echo. in fact i am listening to it as i type this. the echo is in our family room and i am in our office and i was able to ask alexa to play music. for its size, the sound quality is really very good, obviously not the same as a nice stereo system, but impressive all the same. we are still learning what it can do, but having fun with it. my wife got and echo dot from a customer for christmas which she has in her bedroom. we also gave one to our son and his wife for christmas and they enjoy it also. my parents were impressed enough that they got one too!"
374,14,"when we first received our echo, we were not sure what we were going to do with it. now, we do everything with it! i start my day off with my customized flash briefing and then the kids listen to their music on spotify while they are getting ready for school and they check the day is weather so they know what to wear. on my way home from work, i drop in on the kids to make sure they are doing their homework. i listen to a podcast or my latest book on audible when i get home from work and then review the recipes for dinner while i am cooking. we are going to be purchasing some smart lights so we can turn lights on/off in other rooms when the kids leave them on and then we are going to be getting a few echo dots to spread around the house and i will be getting one for my office as well."
375,14,"the amazon echo devices are my new obsession. i first bought the echo spot and decided to get an echo based on reviews for good sound quality. i am not disappointed! the sound is great, voice recognition is great (i.e. alexa understands me most of the time), and the unit itself looks great in my livingroom or kitchen. the echo devices are so fun to use. at first i felt kind of weird using the voice commands, but after a few days it became second nature. it is only a matter of time before i have an echo, echo show, echo spot, or echo dot in every room of my house. i am very impressed."
376,14,"yep, i love it. this is my personal assistant. alexa is able to call people for me, ad well as, work as am intercom and call other echos in my house. so i am no lo her yelling for my kids to come here. lol.she is also able to reorder stuff for me from amazon, tell me the time/weather/date, set reminders, create a shopping list, get me flight information,  find recipes, find music , tell me a joke.i like that i cam tell her to find me a show to watch and bc this echo is connected to my firestick, it will play whatever i ask for, as long as it is available.the volume gets loud enough for me to vacuum and still hear my music playing.  it listens well, maybe too well. some times she interiors me when i am not talking to it. like if i am talking about alexa, and mention ""alexa"" she jumps in. so she is always listening.she can turn the lights on/off, adjust the temp of the house , lock doors and more if you have compatible devices.so many capabilities."
377,14,"we are having so much fun with alexa. she is almost like a real person. she arranges music whether old or new, classic or rock, answers questions, and even tells jokes. during a christmas celebration, our grandson was eating meatballs. someone said be careful and not sneeze or the meatball might roll off the table like in the old song i remember as a child. we wondered what happened to the meatball in the song. alexa found the ""on top of spaghetti"" song and played it to the delight of everyone.we have not hooked up the adapter to be able to shut off lights, call people, or do other things yet. the echo is easy to use and the sound system is wonderful and clear.alexa is now in 4 different family households since christmas. everyone loves alexa and the echo."
378,14,"after using the echo for about a month, i can say it is at best ""entertaining"" at trying to make it understand what you want.  it is search for trivia is lacking.  if you expect results like you would get with a google search, you will be very disappointed.a lot of times my wife and i are watching tv and we ask alexa about an actor or actress, and many times we come up short and resort to google on our tablet.adding skills can add to the functionality, but many of the skills are more for marketing purposes rather than providing useful functionality to you.  there is a ""dewalt tools"" skill that will let you ask:  ""alexa, ask dewalt tools what is your history""...  i would like to meet any person who would find this skill useful... just so i could ask ""why?  why would you enable such a useless skill?""i can see alexa being much more useful if you have smart devices in your home, such as a connected thermostat, roomba, garage door opener, etc.  as asking alexa to change the thermostat setting, or asking if the garage door is open, would be very useful.using alexa to add events to my google calendar is also not quite ready for prime-time.  you would think this would be relatively easy, however, how alexa and google handle timezones creates a problem.  (alexa does not send timezone information with the request, so google assumes the time is gmt when storing the event, however, since google has my timezone set as pst - it converts the gmt time to pst when displaying it.)  personally - imo google has this correct, and alexa should send my timezone with the request to create the event.  after all, she knows my timezone.on the brighter side - alexa does have an opinion - albeit clinical - to the question ""alexa - does size really matter?"""
379,14,"i bought this as a christmas present for the war department and she loves it. we have a great 5.1 stereo downstairs but this echo is so much more convenient. we are still exploring all of things that alexa can do for us. so far she has performed admirably. we can tell her to play a particular type of music, i.e. country, oldies, folk, 70 is, 80,s and so forth. or one can tell her to play a particular artist. for instance i had her play marty robins and then johnny horton followed by hank williams sr. alexa will also provide the listener with the weather report, a news summary or how the stock markets are doing currently. i know that she can do a lot more and we will continue to explore her capabilities. for right now though she is the main crew is entertainment center when we are in the kitchen. btw, set up was a breeze. in short, amazon knocked it out of the park with this product. we would buy echo again in a heartbeat."
380,14,"i never thought i would ever say this about any speaker, but it actually has too much bass for it is own good. it distorts at anything above mid-volume levels. sadly there is no echo equalizer, because turning down the bass some would make it able to play louder and cleaner. otherwise it is a quality product. alexa works really well. you will need to add a larger/better speaker to realize it is full potential for music though."
381,14,"the pro is and con is are extremely arbitrary for a product such as this, solely because its entire functionality is based on an ai based on cloud technology. while definitely not going to be perfect, cloud updates allows alexa to be constantly improving on her feedback and listening while still having the original alexa. she is not going to understand obscure song titles or things in languages other than english, but she will improve over time.the physical product itself is well-built and will last an extended period of time as long as it is not placed in precarious locations or being knocked about. the buttons are responsive enough to serve their intended purpose, but they do not feel like they are meant to be used primarily as a way of controlling the device. if these buttons eventually fail on you for some reason, however, alexa can serve as a substitute for all of the functions they serve. sound quality is excellent for the price and size of the product, with ample volume settings to fill whatever room you want (up to a point).the ability to connect to other echo devices is definitely a plus for creating your own house party with a song playing across all speakers, but quality in that sense is of course dependent on the other devices as well."
382,14,"this is the second one we have purchased in the past few weeks. we liked the first one so well, we purchased another for the upstairs. love that you can play music on both at the same time (by grouping them in the app). very good speaker quality and the microphone picks up voice commands quite well, even over loud music. that said, it is not perfect... gets a little frustrating at times when it does not understand some commands and queries.  but for the most part, it is a handy and fun addition to our household.be advised, if you have an amazon tap (looks like the echo, but has inferior speaker quality and microphone), the echo product line will not ""group"" with it. (we tried.) maybe a future tap software update will allow it to group with echo products in the home, which would be nice since tap owners would have another speaker in the group. i have attached a photo of the amazon tap (on left) alongside the echo."
383,14,"at this point i am not sure if i am going to keep it or send it back. it has been connected for less than 10 days and i have had to re-sync it twice to my network. i have had the echo dot for over a year and have only had to re-sync that once following a power outage after hurricane irma. i will say however that the sound is much more ""rich"" than the dot. but ... the vote on maintaining a network connection is still out."
384,11,"echo 2nd gen vs echo dotsound: of course the echo will have better sound, but it comes out slightly muffled, but the echo dot can connect to a bluetooth speaker like your sound bar.voice recognition: echo dot i feel wins this, with music playing i have less problems with my echo dot. with my echo i have to yell to be heard which is weird considering its suppose to be better at listening.price: echo comes with dolby digits sound, and ""better"" voice recognition. but the echo dot does it all for half the cost.for me the echo dot is the winner especially at $29 for the holiday special"
385,14,"most of the time, i really like my echo. it has a really clean look. it is quite a bit smaller than i expected, but again i think that is nice, particularly if you decide to buy several of them to set up in different parts of your house. the sound quality is great, and i actually bought a couple more to take advantage of the play everywhere feature. it usually does what i want it to.there is some glitchy behavior with the software still. it randomly loses the ability to do skills that it previously performed (e.g. ""start my day""). while it interacts with the nest thermostat in some ways (e.g. ""set temperature to 72 degrees""), it can not do much more than that with nest (e.g. ""turn fan on"" does not do anything). i am hoping that the software will continue to improve and that i will not regret buying echo instead of one of the other options from google, apple, etc."
386,14,"got it today....still playing around with it.  i have a lovely soothing thunderstorm playing now!!  took me a little while to connect, but i am not as technically savvy as i used to be (i am 65).  got myself connected to iheartradio (60 is music) and was having a wonderful time jammin' to sly stone and the family  :o)  sound is  great!  great bass.  clear, volume is great.  i am having a wonderful time.tried the alarm..(you can change the alert sound if you want).  got the weather for tomorrow.  started a shopping list...figure  out the phone part tomorrow..(maybe)those of you who are hesitant.  go for it!!"
387,14,"i purchased the ech because of all the tv and reviews. but i have to say, echo is no siri.  first it is not easy to connect the light control. there are many steps to take, plus you need a hub no matter what the light bulbs say or direction on the paper. 2 nd you must install ever skill you want alexia to do.  that can be a million things. from good morning to what is the tallest building.  3rd. if the tv is on alexia does not answer right away.  echo needs to away from other sounds, she will say do not knot that answer. even if it is hello.  i like the echo but i.t needs a lot more improvements to get 4 stars."
388,14,"i almost got one of these last december, but i kept asking myself what am i really going to do with it, and could not come up with a compelling reason. i decided to hold off then, but here we are a year later and the idea of home automation is quite a bit more appealing to me now than it was a year ago. i decided to get my feet wet with an echo and some philips hue bulbs. setup was pretty straightforward, the echo was up and running and controlling the philips hue bulbs in about 10 minutes.i was immediately impressed with the echo is sound quality when playing music. it actually has some decent bass for being such a tiny thing. i had originally intended on placing it in the kitchen, which is more or less centrally located in the house; however, when i tried playing some music the sound quality was good enough that i figured it would be a potential replacement for my bedside alarm clock radio. i now have it in the bedroom and it does a really great job of filling the room with sound, with surprising bass given the small form factor. i was secondly impressed by the echo is mic pickup; just as a test i tried giving a command from near the kitchen with the bedroom door closed (but not shut) and it picked up my command (i was not yelling, either).the integration with the philips hue bulbs is what i initially got the echo for, and it rocks for that. it is handy being able to tell the echo to turn on or off certain lights from elsewhere in the house; for example, no more walks down a dark hallway to the bathroom in the middle of the night - i can ask alexa to turn on the bathroom lights as i am getting out of bed, and the hallway is sufficiently illuminated for me (without turning on bedroom lights that might disturb others). also nice if you are laying in bed falling asleep and just do not want to get up to flick the light switch off - just ask alexa ""turn off the bedroom lights"". you also get dimming control, which is great. and, you can control them while away from the home - never walk into a dark home again.my initial impression with the echo and the philips hue bulbs was positive enough that i went out and got another four pack of bulbs and a dot for the kitchen. i may eventually put another echo in the kitchen (for the superior sound quality listening to music over the dot), and then relocate the dot to the living room or another bedroom, or wherever ends up making most sense. i am now looking at the full gamut of iot home automation devices such as thermostats, cams, and locks. i feel like the echo is the perfect gateway into that world."
389,14,"at first l was not quite sure what to make of alexa but now that l have a lot of her functions operating l am really pleased. favorite thing is the music. i can hear any song anytime! and the volume is great without speakers. also l am able to program what is referred to as a ""flash briefing"" that you hear daily. alexa has a wide range of topics. you just pick what you are interested in and it is that simple. for instance mine starts with the weather goes to jimmy fallon, cnn, pastor g, the skimm, tv info, good news network, my zen practice, motivational quotes, people magazine, and ends with humor. i love this because it is personalised to my interests. also you can say ""next"" anytime to skip to the next topic. i am still learning and adding new things when possible. and since l am not a pet owner l have stopped talking to myself when l am home alone... hehe"
390,14,"three stars is generous, but to me it is 2 1/2 stars at best. i was disappointed too like many other 1st generation echo users.the bad: the sound, of course. you definitely can hear the difference between the two generations. you would expect, hope and want the 2nd gen. to be better, but it did not happen. i have the same sound issues (complaints) as the other reviewers.for some skills, it seems that there is a 1/2 sec. to a sec. delay in performing them. while this is not a major concern, it can be annoying when you are used to a faster performance. and sometimes you wonder if alexa heard you at all.the good: i like the smaller size and i like the option for different shells. the fabric ones look the best to me.it makes me wonder what amazon was thinking (or not thinking). you do not have to be in a laboratory to hear the sound difference. perhaps they were in a rush to get the product out in time for the christmas season...and before apple and google release their similar products in december.conclusion: if you have only had the dot or never had the original echo, then this device may be for you. if you have the 1st gen. device, i would not recommend an upgrade and just keep what you have."
391,10,"i really did not see much need for home assistants like the echo until i won one at my office christmas party.  i quickly became so addicted that i bought this second one a week later.  alexa is great in the kitchen (timers and unit conversions), wonderful at entertaining (music and games), and incredibly helpful (answering questions and controlling lights).  i have to admit that my wife has not yet warmed up to the idea of asking alexa to turn on and off lights, but she definitely enjoys having alexa play music and getting quick answers to questions.  be forewarned, getting an echo will forever change your life."
392,14,i love my amazon echo. i have always wanted an amazon echo since it was first released and i got it while it was on sale! although i think that alexa still needs much more improvement because many of the things that i ask alexa she should be able to do like a web search to find me the answer but i think sometimes she is just too lazy to do that. for some of the stuff that i am asking her or trying to find information on i think that a google home would have fared better. although i must say that we really do enjoy the music aspect of alexa. i just wish i could get the aux out to work properly so i could hook it up to the home audio system that is built into my home.
393,14,"i have an original  echo and was very satisfied with the sound quality.  i got my 2nd gen and was very excited to see how the new improved version would sound.  yikes!  sounds like someone stuffed a blanket into the speaker.  the richness of sound is gone from what the original offered.  the units all (3 of them) ""updated"" automatically after install, but the sound is the same.  i think these will have to go back.  very saddened by the lack of quality."
394,11,the 2nd generations are amazing!! i bought three to utilize the whole home audio and they sound much better than the 1st gen model. can not wait to add more and buy interchangeable shells!!! great job amazon you never disappoint
395,14,"echo works great!  we needed an intercom so i would not have to yell to get hubby to hear me when he is upstairs with the tv on and we also needed some wireless speakers for music. with echo, we got both.  be aware, however, that in order to download the echo\alexa app, you must have a cell phone with an ios of 9 or greater.  we now have new phones as well!  <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0095> the speakers are quite good for casual listening and can be ""grouped"" together or played separately.  especially like the list feature that enables me to add items to my grocery list verbally from the kitchen, then open the list on my (new) cell phone when i get to the grocery store.  no more forgetting my list!  this may sound elementary to younger folks, but for us seniors, it is pretty amazing stuff."
396,14,"love, love my new echo. the speakers are great; i guess i did not have the issues that others have had. my kids and i love finding new stuff for alexa to do. the kids love playing games with her. i connected her with the tp-link smart plug that was $5 additional with the promotion and have her connected to the lamps in my bedroom. i love being able to ask her to turn on and off the light when needed. this product is so versatile and so far, we are enjoying it more than i thought we ever would. i plan on installing a compatible thermostat very soon, as i see great potential to save money on utilities. i have put several dots around my home as well, with this being the ""main alexa"" in my living area. they are all great products. i highly recommend to anyone wanting to turn their home into a smart home. i loved them so much i purchased everyone in my family one for christmas."
397,14,"i tried to cancel order after reading reviews, but it was too late. kind of glad. about 10 minutes after setting it up alexa came on and said it was going to do an update. i think the sound is better, but then all i have are dots to compare it with. i gave it only 3 stars because when i asked her to play a singer from my music it took quite a while to kick in - dot is much quicker.update: after listening more since first review alexa and audible books sound extremely muffled. very irritating. got to drop a star. may return."
398,14,"i have an echo 1st gen and it is way better than the echo 2nd gen i just received. neither are worth a bleep for music. the 2nd gen has terrible sound! shame on amazon for releasing such a piece of garbage. i¡¯m returning it.edited to add:another reviewer said s/he got a firmware update to version 592452420 and now their echo 2nd gen sounds great. i called and talked to amazon customer service and verified i had the latest firmware, which i do, the one listed above. perhaps it helped a tiny bit, but the sound from the 2nd gen is still horrible. anything over volume 3 and you get a tinny high pitched almost static type of sound and the base just sucks. this device is no good for music at all, even with the latest firmware. face facts, firmware can only fix a few minor issues. if the hardware (speakers) are garbage then the sound will be garbage. no firmware is going to fix this issue. amazon released a subpar device and they do not seem to care. i am tired of testing it and trying to make it acceptable, i just called amazon and initiated the return of this garbage. i like amazon and it is services, but i will not buy anymore of their cheaply made garbage devices."
399,14,"there is a lot to like about the echo 2nd gen.  you still have the typical alexa skills (change thermostat temperature, weather, news, etc), and it sounds significantly better than the echo dots. compared with the original echo, the sound quality is roughly the same (maybe slightly more muffled on the echo 2), it looks better next to the other furniture in the room, and the volume mechanism is not as good (they are buttons instead of the volume wheel turn).one minor issue is the response time seems to be slightly slower than the echo or echo dots. the alexa keyword wakeup is just as fast, but requesting information on the web (weather) or playing the news/music seems to be delayed a moment more than previous devices."
400,11,well worth the wait.  i originally bought a dot last year. while the dot was good this new version of the echo surpasses it. great sound quality. seems to have better voice recognition as it responds faster and picks up your voice easier. my only grip with any of the echo are when watching wwe.  when alexa bliss is wrestling my echo is constantly says sorry but i do not understand your request.  lol
401,14,"i am very disappointed with this device. its sound quality is so poor that both my s/o and myself find it difficult to understand the responses and there are so many questions that it cannot answer. basic questions that google answered in depth when i asked the same question. also, i had a terrible time setting this model up to control my tv and my additional media components. fight now, it will turn the tv on and off, but not much more.i am considering returning this and the second unit that i purchased. almost worthless when compared with asking google the same question."
402,14,"the microphones are vastly more responsive on this echo over 1st gen, but this thing takes 10x as long to respond.... and does not even come close to the audio quality of the gen1. their bass driver(which delivers little) distorts all midrange sound and obliterates treble. if you listen to a wide variety of music... this echo is not for you. get the gen1 or the echo plus.the microphone performance is the only reason i gave two stars, but i believe the sensitivity of these microphones has caused the delayed responses."
403,14,"getting an echo provides more fun than a person should have legally. from ""alexa, tune radio 54.00"" to "" what year did music composer  mozart  die?"" she can answer most questions, read you a story, tell a joke, and with the right optional devices can lock your doors, turn the lights down, start the tv, change the room temperature, to singing you a song ( just tried it and she is singing me a tune, music and all!  you can teach it skills for even more info and fun.  she can be a bit nosey if you mention her name and she can hear like a wolf."
404,14,"before purchasing this echo, i read many of the reviews between the 5 star and 1 star categories.  i also read the alexa app review which was not great.  i decided to give the echo a try anyway, and i received it on 12/28/17.  it worked effortlessly for about 5 days...then i lost the wi-fi connection.  followed every instruction i could find to fix this, including contacting my internet service provided who assured me all was fine on their end.  since my other devices were working, i then called customer service, sent the echo in for repair, got it back 4 days later and tried again.  same problem, so it was returned, and a brand new one was delivered immediately.  when i connected that one, i had the same issue.  i decided it was not an echo problem and that it had to be a wi-if connection problem.  decided to order a new router with stronger capabilities and, as of today, the problem has been resolved.  for those of you leaving 1 star reviews due to connectivity issues, i suggest you look a bit further to determine if a stronger router would take care of this issue for you as it did for me.  and thank you, amazon, for all you did to try and alleviate this problem when your product was not to blame at all."
405,14,"i got this as a gift for my husband who does not have a smartphone.  you do have to set it up with a smartphone, no problem since i have one but glad i read the other reviews first.  it seems alexa has a hard time hearing me but no problem hearing him.  i do not know if it is the pitch of my voice or that i naturally do not speak loudly.  the music sounds great on it.  although i can not ask for a specific song or i get a sample.  i signed up for amazon prime so he could play his favorite artists.  it will play the artist is songs and you can skip.  so far i have one smart outlet to try before setting up more and probably will not.  i have a light attached and once in awhile it goes off and on for no reason.  there are some funny ""skills"" that alexa knows and she is getting more all the time.  it is a little buggy but for weather, music, news, it is great."
406,14,"does not meet my expectations! i have tried multiple times to set up with music from my phone, and it will not recognize my playlist from my phone, nor does it recognize music my sonos! it does however, recognize amazon music if you are a subscriber. i wish i can return this, i truly do not like it. i am going to sell it if i can not return it.  echo is tied in with amazon library and thats it, and tunein station and anything else you are required to join/subscribe too. also, my sonos has a better sound than alexa. :("
407,14,"if you are searching for an alexa enabled speaker to listen to music on look elsewhere. the sound quality on this speaker is a huge letdown and step down from the first generation device. after listening to a couple of songs on spotify i had it back in it is packaging to be returned. i am not exaggerating when i say that a portable speaker that was purchased at fraction of the cost of this device sounds more lively.putting ""improved sound"" in the item title is incredibly misleading. the sound output on this is not at all comparable to the first generation echo."
408,14,"we upgraded our echo dot to the echo 2nd generation a few days ago.  supposedly, the echo 2 has better sound and volume quality because of larger, improved speakers.  the sound is more robust but poor alexa speaks as though she has a pillow over her head.  the speech quality is muffled, making it hard to understand some of the responses to queries.  the music is also far from clear or crisp.  the small $30 bluetooth ihome speaker i paired with the former dot had better voice and music quality than the echo 2nd generation.  the echo 2nd generation is a sound quality disappointment; this being the reason it gets only three stars.  we had paid for upgraded amazon music unlimited with the echo dot, but after replacing the dot with the echo 2, alexa now mumbles she will play song samples, however we can upgrade to unlimited if we choose.  i suspect this problem can be fixed by contacting amazon, which i have not yet done."
409,11,"not responsive. i am returning it. amaozn is sending another one. i hope the new one is better. i also have a dot, it response every time. i sure hope the new one works as well as the dot does. the top lights up like it hears me but nothing happen. if i give it the same command over and over again eventually it will work.  not what i was hoping for."
410,14,"this is such a disappointment i do not where to begin.  first i had planned to use this device as a stand alone to play music, specifically numerous playlist i have created over the years of music collection.  after uploading a couple different playlist, i reached the limit of allowable upload, almost.  but then without notice amazon ended that service and plans to permanently discontinue it, deleting the playlist and time invested.  as it is alexa struggle to play my music playlist, her hearing suffers.  i have renamed them, but she still regularly stumbles.  if i want to play my music i have to bluetooth my ipod.the next thing i discovered was the linking up smart home devices has not been as easy as i was led to believe and in some case never worked.  i have really come to dislike this device as a result of hours wasted trying to achieve seemingly easy task.  i am looking into other options now as i do not find the convenience of this overpriced dumb speaker worthy of continued disappointment.  as to the point of its sound... not bad.  so maybe that is worth the one star that i have to give it."
411,14,"i am senior who is reluctant about adopting modern technologies since they often prove to be a passing fad. i was given an echo for christmas and reluctantly decided to give it a chance.  i found it to be transformative as a technology, so much, that i had to purchase another to extend its uses throughout my house.  the most important feature is that its simple and intuitive to setup, really appreciate that since i am not a patient person and quick to dismiss a product that requires too much fussing.  i find it great for streaming music and news stations from multiply sources including my siriusxm account. great as an alarm clock, calendar reminder and timer especially when cooking or as an interval timer for exercise.  love the fact that i can create an audible grocery list as i inventory kitchen/bath.  especially useful as an intercom for speaking to others across the house or making hands free phone calls. all this utility packed in a single device, its great! i am now convinced that this is the next wave of disruptive technology (like smart phones) that will quickly spread through most households."
412,14,"amazing, amazing, and amazing! i just got it literally an hour ago. there was an update a few minutes after setup and the audio is quite impressive for something about the size of a soda can. i had to adjust the treble and bass a bit for my liking but wow! i¡¯ll be buying more for my daughters.one thing i noticed is that placement is important. mine is on my dresser behind my tv. alexa hears me but i do have to speak up a bit. placed on the nightstand and no troubles at all.the sound quality as i¡¯ve already stated is impressive. i have a pioneer stereo with massive speakers, and once the eq is adjusted on the echo, the sound quality comes pretty close to my monster sized speakers.if you¡¯re looking for a stereo but space is an issue, this echo is a definite plus. my only issue, as petty as it may seem, is if it could have audio leveling so volume adjustment does not need to be made for older, lower volume music, such as prince is ¡°for you¡± album."
413,14,"she is a fun little toy i bought for my husband. he speaks way too fast for her, so i re- ask her questions. husband is learning!  i have not yet figured out how to pair her with my phone, lites, etc. it is going to take some time/research  and right now i have none of that. it is easy to place in a central location and she responds from a ways away. speak slowly and have your question ready...i.e. do not say ""um""  or ""like. she does not have all the answers, but if you re ask in a different way, most of the time she gets it. her jokes are hillarious!!! you need to get her attention first... say ""alexa"", then ask the question...not all at once. i do not play games so i cannot comment on that aspect. although we did play rock paper sissors-- which is a visual game...i wass not sure how that would go but i easily and quickly figured her out! fun toy so far. much more to find out so stars may go up later!"
414,14,"not really a regular echo, it seems to be an in between the dot and regular echo. amazon split their echo lines into 3 devices. echo dot, echo which is this one and echo pro at 49.99, 99.99 and 199.99 prices. amazon why do not you just market them as such. it seems amazon convinced former large echo the 199.99 one to switch to this one as they say the sound quality is better and of course its is not its the in between version so many angry disappointed customers, ¡°really amazon¡±. i have the echo dot and not the regular echo so to me sounds much better than that one but is more like the google one."
415,14,"this is an absolutely great product.  it is fun exploring the world of alexa.  it was bought primarily as an assistive aid for my ailing father to set alarms for medications, taking blood glucose levels, etc and has turned into alot more.  no day is complete without the flash briefing or jeopardy or the silly joke of the day.  alexa, who is an entity in our household, gets asked please and thank you constantly by very gentlemanly father.  i am almost surprised to never hear her say ""you are welcome.""  the alexa platform is not very good at answering question requiring extensive search engine knowledge but the other capabilities are really cool.  my elderly father has no problems operating alexa.  i have added a dot and will be adding smart plugs and other items moving forward.  you are the alexa, you will be assimilated!"
416,14,"product arrived on time and performs as promised.  good quality product and sounds very good considering size.  although i thought it might be an intimidating process, the installation was quick and easy as described after downloading the ""alexa app' on my android phone. it connected easily to my home wifi network, and started working quickly.  i find it funny that when the ford f-150 ad comes on tv and the driver asks his truck ""alexa, is a hotdog a sandwich?"" my echo perks up to answer.pros- quality device for a decent price.- easy and quick setup.- much easier to use than digging out my android phone and saying ""ok google""- can control items such as fire stick, samsung tv, light dimming, etc. (some require extra items e.g. wemo, harmony hub, etc.)"
417,9,"i have 6 echos, 1 show, 1 og echo, 2 dots, and a tap. this 2nd gen echo is by far the best sounding of the 6. followed by the og/tap and show. i loved this one so much, that i bought this for each of my family members for christmas. my brother in law uses it as his main stereo unit, and loves it quite a bit. i am very happy with the sound and with the look."
418,14,"i¡¯ve had echos since they first was launched. i also have two echo shows as well. have one in every room. love them all. use them many times a day. would now be lost without them. helps in so many daily task. love the hands few making shopping list, baking and doing multiple timers. adding app to calendar by voice. listening to any music the suits you mood. i use them with smart lighting, and smart plugs..etc. it is a buy, that you¡¯ll never know how you did without. and it is easy to set up, and as always amazons customer service is  phenomenal."
419,14,"got all of my grandchildren an echo for christmas and they were thrilled.  they are using it primarily for music, as am i, but everyone has enjoyed seeing what alexa can do and playing games with her.  my husband asks her questions that require a judgement on her part which, of course, she can not respond to.  he is the only one who is less than thrilled.  the sound system fills the room and it is so convenient to request a song or an artist.  some of my requests are not on amazon prime music, so she goes to pandora.  then i get a commercial once in awhile.  overall, i have liked having her around and i know i am not using all of her capabilities."
420,14,"cool device but poor set-up procedure.  froze several times and required rebooting both echo and re-installing the app on my iphone.  this also occurred when switching the wifi.  in the end, was able to work through the issues but it took too long with too many issues.  i just recently upgraded to an iphone 8 from a 6 and it was seamless and how set-ups should work.  i was going to get one for my parents who are in their late 70 is as i see many potential benefits for the elderly but there is no way they could set it up with these issues.  more work to do amazon on the customer experience....use apple as a benchmark."
421,0,"i enjoy this product quite a bit. i do not like that when the power goes out, so does she. i was using her as an alarm. dont. my power was out...alarm did not sound. i also do not like that she does not have a good search engine. when asking random questions, she will just say she does not have access to that information...lady you are online! you have access to it all! she needs to have a better search engine feature to call up all available content on the internet. i appreciate everything she is currently able to do, however. i hope updates will come out that improve this functionality."
422,14,"lots of fun for my sharp 90 yr old dad who lives by himself. we did have a bit of a problem setting this up for him because dad does not have an amazon acct, no computer (vision problems), and no cell phone. however, my husband and son prevailed and dad is now enjoying the fun history and music games, big band music, daily joke, weather, news, game scores, and engaging in informational conversation with his new live-in girlfriend, alexa."
423,11,"i have two echo dots and received the echo 2nd generation device the first day on the market. the design is great in its self. the sound is extremely good. i have one of my echo dots hooked up to my bose wave radio. of course the new echo is not going to sound like a bose and did not expect it too. i have to give credit to amazon for the excellent sound it does provide right out of the box. the new one we have in the master bedroom. i do believe the microphones in the new echo are far greater than the earlier models....all in all, excellent product and reasonably price.."
424,14,"total let down. this is my first ever echo, meaning i didnt have the first gen. but the advertisements seemed so cool, i really wanted to try it out, even bought 2 of them because i was so excited. biggest let down is that i literally have to ask alexa to do or play something 3 to 4 times until she finally even responds. its not that she replies right away and says that she cant do that certain thing i asked like she sometimes does which i understand...its the fact that she doesnt even respond even after being right next to it and asking over 4 times. the concept is cool... but would be better if it wasnt so frustrating to use. considering returning."
425,14,i spent some time pondering whether to purchase this or the sonos speaker with alexa built in. frugality won out. i bought this as part of a bunch of stuff to automate my home. it was on sale black friday for $20 off. when it arrived i was pleasantly surprised at how small it is. it was easy to configure. i now turn my lights on and off by asking alexa. as well as ask her other questions. i am intrigued at being able to make phone calls. i also have it linked to amazon music and pandora. the sound is pretty good for a little speaker. it is a nice service.
426,10,"this echo not only sounds amazing in my large great room/kitchen area while playing music but i love alexa!! she finds great music for me, tells me jokes, tells me the weather, interesting facts, sets timers, alarms, etc.. i mean i have only had her since christmas day, but i am discovering something new she can do everyday. she also can talk to my honeywell thermostat so i can warm up the house before i even get out of bed! in my opinion, you would have to be crazy to not give the echo a try - especially at the $79.99 price i grabbed mine for! i am very pleased with my purchase!!"
427,14,"i literally have tears in my eyes!  this machine or intelligence has given me more happiness in the few short hours since it was programmed than i can describe. i think it is simply incredible and being able to request the exact music i wish to hear at that very moment, is worth far beyond what amazon charges.  i also purchased one for my mother and at 82, i cannot wait for her to be able to listen to music and ask alexa questions. she uses uber so now she can simply request a ride rather than going to her cell phone.  i am so excited that i am purchasing one for all of my siblings."
428,14,"<u+00a0>i received this as a gift xmas 2017. the sound and clarity are very good. i had not of an issue with the set up as my son received the echo dot. there were so many blue tooth, phones etc on it was almost comical, almost. i enjoy it very much but a lot of questions asked are not known or censored. i am on amazon now to try and figure out how to change the name from alexa to something else. i think you should be able to pick the wake word upon setting it up. so far, it is been fun, like blue tooth plus."
429,14,this is the 5th echo i have installed in my apartment.  works and sounds great.  i believe the sound (musically) is as good or even better than my first generation echo devices.  although i am going to eventually connect this one to my sound bar in my living room via audio cable.  i do like the different styles of covers that you can put on the device so that is a nice decorating option.  anyway it is working great and i am happy with my purchase.  having a device in each room to turn lights off and on and do all the other things makes things very nice and convenient.
430,14,"love my new echo, where has alexa been my whole life. this is the first step to adding some automation to my home as we have added 3 smart plugs and love having the ability to turn the lights on and off by voice.i love to cook and always looking for recipes, found out that not only will alexa find a recipe for me she will send it to the app for me.i could go on forever, have not found one thing i do not love about my echo. the setup was a piece of cake and was up and running with an update in about 5 minutes.keep up the great work amazon and look forward to the next generation."
431,14,i had a sonos one that worked great with alexa and i bought this thinking it would be great to bring alexa to a couple more rooms and listen to music in multiple rooms.  not so. you can not link these with the sonos.  no problem i am not to picky i can ask alexa to start music in each room individually right? wrong again if you try to play music in a second room you have to cancel the music in the first room.  rediculus.alexa is unable to handle the simplest tasks like add multiple items to a list. i find google assistant to be much more helpful and it works well with apps i use.  if it was not trash day when i received these i would have put them back in the boxes and returned them the next day.
432,9,my son gave me one and today my daughters husband gave her we both love it we can call each other the speaker is amazing alexa is my personal assistant she can remind you of appointments or even to just lock the doors she is great and this echo is better than a bose wave system this only takes up a small space but fills the room with crystal clear sound .i love it also such a great price the quality is so great you would think it would be more expensive .this is a great gift idea !!!!!
433,14,"every day, i find new uses for my echo, 2nd gen., and have been very happy with its performance so far. (i have the latest updated software version: 592452720).i love being able to set multiple timers when i am cooking and not having to touch a physical timer with messy hands. we use the intercom feature to talk to each other when in separate rooms on different floors: ""dinner is ready"", etc. i have even used it to place phone calls- the sound is often clearer than on cell-to-cell calls. linking it to audible is another handy feature of which we have made use, as my husband and i like to relax and listen to books together. every morning my husband listens to his flash briefing while eating his breakfast, and then checks with alexa for his commute time to work. he also uses one in the bedroom as an alarm clock, and loves the snooze feature. we even used it to play ""spooky sounds"" at halloween as part of our elaborate decorations for trick-or-treaters!  and we do play music through it as well- we enjoy having different play lists for different settings/moods. i know initially there were a lot of complaints about the sound quality, especially when compared with the 1st. gen echo, but with the latest software, i am very happy with the sound quality.i expect alexa will keep learning and functionality will keep growing. we are finding both useful and fun applications for this device, and i expect we will find many more as time goes on."
434,14,"***edit at the end of the original review... ***second edit following that...  ***third one just now...if you are a seasoned echo user, do not think that this is going to be an upgrade to your audio desires.the original echo sounds better.  period.i miss the volume spin-ring on the top of it, but mostly, i miss the better sound out of the original.  seems like this one gets louder at full volume, but the sound quality suffers, most likely due to the smaller resonating chamber and lack of a bass port.  not to mention, they reduced the size of the tweeter.  should have put that dolby tech to task on the original design.pros:  shorter and less likely to be knocked over.might be more aesthetically pleasing.has an ""aux out"" 3.5mm jack to hook it up to a home system.cons:  does not sound as well.no volume ring to spin around.no led to indicate connectivity - white on the original = online, amber = seeking or no connection.volume up/down buttons are slow to respond, original ring design was much better.if you are new and into the market, look for a ""certified refurbished"" first generation model and you will get better sound out of it.it is a shame that amazon advertises this as having better audio than the previous generation.  just the same as taking away the ring volume adjuster in favor of the up and down buttons, it is obvious that amazon is really trying to drive their production costs down and sadly, the quality seems to have really suffered with this release.*** edit 11-20-17 -yes, the sound quality has improved after the pushed update to the software came through.bass is noticeably improved, and as far as i can tell, this one sounds better than my three first-gen echos now after the update.that being said, it does seem that even though this version advertises better microphone recognition, i find myself having to speak louder to gain it is attention over the first generation.  quite often.  i wonder if that has to do with the seven pinhole microphone ports on this one versus the countless ones on the top of the original.  sometimes i have to yell at it just to get it to ""wake"" and recognize a command.  hopefully, this additional problem will be resolved in an update soon.i am leaving the review at three stars at this point because even though my initial dissatisfaction with the sound quality seems to have been resolved, the more i use it, the more i realize other shortcomings it has.  hopefully these issues will be resolved and i can revise my review in the future, but for the time being i have been in contact with amazon and they have extended my return period until after christmas, and if these issues are not fixed before then, look for my unit listed on their site as a refurbished one.***ok, this thing is really starting to rub me the wrong way.  i lay in bed with this one that i play music on, and these microphones positively suck.  i tell her to send a message, and the original echo in a bedroom 50 feet away picks it up and cancels this one out, so the message is sent and the recipient thinks i am sending the message from the bottom of a pool with my lungs full of water.  i am reducing my initial rating from three stars to a single one because i have gotten so agitated at this device on several occasions that made me want to throw it against the wall.  i have not been this pissed off at an electronic item in a long time.  it is a shame, every other amazon device i have been using far exceeded my expectations, and it just seems like this redesigned model was rushed to market too soon and with cheaper materials.*** edit 2-22-18 -i have since set up a ""group"" among several alexa devices, and even with the most recent updates, i still contend that the sound quality is simply better on the original echo.  i have three of those, so i would like to say that i am able to tell the difference.  also compared this second generation echo with the same audio feed to an echo show.  the show compares much better to the original echo, but does lack the omni-directional sound projection of either the original echo and this, the second generation echo.microphones seem to have improved, as i have set up both an original and second gen echo side-by-side, and the newer echo is the first one to pick up and cancel the older one out."
435,14,"we purchased this right around when it came out and it is gone through some major sound upgrades. at first it sounded slightly better than our echo dot (yes it was terrible). after several firmware updates the sound is very good. it is not a sonos or some high-end speaker, but for a $99 speaker it is very good.we have the echo plus, the echo (2nd gen), and the echo dot. we found the sound on the echo plus to be superior to the echo (even after all the firmware updates). we also like the twist dial knob for volume on the echo plus over the plus/minus buttons (the same as the echo dot) on the echo 2nd gen. as for voice recognition both the echo plus and echo 2nd gen are fantastic...i am talking music full blast and you can casually say ""alexa"" and it hears you.i would rate this 4.5 stars and the echo plus 5 stars. the echo plus sounds better and i prefer the twist dial knob for volume control vs buttons. the built in smart hub and free hue light that come with the echo plus along with the better sound makes it worth the extra $50 compared to echo 2nd gen. it is not like you can go wrong with either, but for the extra $50 i would say to get the echo plus."
436,10,we love it!  my husband had dementia and he is able to sing and dance with the music whenever he wants to.  i¡¯m thrilled to have a variety of music available.
437,14,"i have been shooting the breeze with alexa for a couple of hours now. asked questions, played music and games. i am not super tech savvy so this just blows my mind! lol. wifi would it to my speaker bar but this echo has better sound than the bar! i really think the grandkids are going to love asking it a million questions and hearing it make fart sounds! yes...i did laugh!amazon will own the world! <f0><u+009f><u+00a4><u+00a4>"
438,14,"awesome product which was added to my echo dot collection but i had an extremly frustrating situation which when solve is very simple. this solution is so extremey simple to amazon, alexa and its engineers that they never address it in any of their faq is. this overlooked solution should at least be mentioned as a possible conflict when having multiple echos, dots, show etc. it is never mentioned and trust me i went thru their straight forward setup procedures and then resorted to uninstalling stuff that was working. i am creating drama for emphasis of my frustration, now its time to address the stumbled upon solution. my dot was connected to my spotfy account, after connecting my echo it did not connect to my spotify account. i panic and did the group thing, still my echo would not connect to spotify period, it tried connecting to amazon and gave the no library setting answer. purely accidential i asked alexa to switch accounts(yeah i have household 2 users). problem solved...really amazon!"
439,14,"the echo was very easy to set up. it recognized and connected with my wifi quickly and easily. the echo is responsive to voice commands. i was amazed at the range of the mics in the device. i can be in the kitchen or the bedroom and ask alexa something and she will respond. this happens, even with the tv on alongside the echo. granted, it is only a 1,00 square foot house, but still...also, have had very few incidents where alexa did not understand or respond. all in all, a very good product. i would recommend getting an external speaker, as the ""improved sound quality"" still leaves something to be desired. i had a bluetooth speaker system which paired easily with the echo and improves the sound. am looking forward to adding to this system to control various things in the house. would recommend the echo."
440,11,"very disappointed in amazon over the newest generation echo.  i¡¯ve always been impressed with the quality and thought they put into products, but the sound quality on the new echo is simply terrible!  tinny with almost no bass or depth, and they certainly do not live up to the description of ¡°improved sound quality¡±. love the look compared to first gen, but that is probably not enough to convince me to keep the three units i bought. more than likely, i¡¯ll be returning them and going with something different."
441,14,"ordered 3 of these after being quite pleased with an echo dot but wanting more volume and multi-room coverage.echo is responsive in general, but has a few caveats.pros:- easy to set up- decent volume- expanding functionality- convenientcons:- does not always identify where you are at when speaking (in particular, the echo in my livingroom occasionally responds along with either of the others when the others are asked a question from a bedroom).- does not always respond easily when playing music (you have to yell at it)"
442,14,"started with the echo dot and realized that i really like these products so i bought the echo.  my echo is my sleep sound machine and my alarm clock.  it is so nice to just tell alexa to ""stop"" when the alarm goes off without reaching over to hit a button.  then i ask her what the local temperature is and what is on my calendar for the day.  lastly, i ask her to turn on my lights.  my lights are also connected with the kasa app so when i am not home, i am able to turn lights on throughout the house.  you can not go wrong with the echos.  amazon continuously sends emails on things you can do with alexa."
443,14,"i have not used this new echo yet as it is a christmas gift but i did want to give amazon credit for the packaging (secure), shipping (as always, fast) and the accuracy of the pics. this echo seemed bigger to me once i got it than i gleaned from the pics which is not a bad thing. it feels sturdy in your hands and has some weight to it. i liked that as i do not feel like it¡¯ll easily topple over. i have a counter surfing land shark for a dog and a kiddo with energy and hijinks to match. minus the teeth, this thing feels like it¡¯ll stand up to both of them without easily being damaged. it does not feel fragile. the exterior does not have that cheap fake wood look to it, it actually looks better in person than in the description pics. lastly, i¡¯ll try to update after it is in use but we have several family members that love theirs, specifically one family member who is blind. this has opened up a whole new world for them and they would not part with it for anything."
444,14,"i received the all new echo as a birthday present three days ago, and i was thrilled to be able to listen to my music, podcasts, and audiobooks. but 3 days later, the thing just does not work! i connected it to spotify, and it worked at first. but now when i ask alexa to play music on spotify, there is either silence or she says she will resume playing music on spotify, but then nothing happens. i have the same problem when trying to listen to a podcast. she says she will play it on anypod (the podcast app i downloaded from the skills section), but then nothing happens.also, the voice recognition is really bad. even when i speak really slowly, she misunderstands me. no one has ever complained about my pronunciation or my articulation. i think it is pretty good, in fact, but alexa can not understand most of what i ask her."
445,14,"this is a review of the list echo i received. love the sound; alexa gets more and more accessible, that is useful. but the sound has an annoying habit of cutting out from time to time for short or even longer lengths of time and sometimes cuts completely off. i tried to get some help from the techs provided but they did not know what to do except uninstall it and then re-install, which did no good. so i sent this one back and got a replacement. in the interim i found out that in the confusion i had signed up for a trial period of amazon unlimited. so when the new one came i changed over to amazon music and, guess what, no cut outs. so i am figuring the problem is with the unlimited. i cut the subscription down to one devise and will use amazon music instead for most of my listening."
446,14,"while i¡¯m enjoying the functionality of the echo 2, i¡¯m sorely disappointed in the sound quality.  it is pretty weak. no bass at all, and the rest of the range sounds like it is coming out of a soda can.i¡¯m reading some people have received a software update.  some say it helped, otters not so much.  i¡¯d like to get the update (do not know how) to see if it helps at all."
447,14,"i was a little angry that my wife spent money on this stupid thing, to begin. i would not use it, the entire concept was ridiculous and inane.butthe kid loved it. my wife loved it.next thing i know, i am using the stupid thing - and i kind of like it. after that, i bought two of the echo dots and four smart plugs and a kindle fire tv and of course i have to say that now, i like it. i gave it five stars because my wife will be broken hearted if she finds out that i do not really like it.i definitely do not ask alexis to play rain sounds at night before bed.i definitely do not ask alexis what the weather will is every morning before i get out of bed.as i stated before, this is a stupid product and i do not like it.okay i like it a little."
448,0,"i was surprised to find that echo has almost no bible knowledge.  bible questions that i asked that are available on the internet, could not be answered.  if i asked for a specific bible reference to be read, it could not do it.  i was also surprised that echo could not help me with crossword puzzles.  questions like:  ""how high is the empire state building,"" and ""how many square feet in an acre"" were answered quickly.  i guess i need more time to see what echo can do.  so far, it is a fun novelty, but limited practical value to me."
449,11,"the echo(second generation) is considerably smaller and more attractive than it is predecessor.  it appears that the sound quality is somewhat better, but the improvement is not overly significant.  the fact that it is smaller helps, and it blends nicely with one is home environment.on the negative side, i would have wanted the echo to have an attached battery pack which was missing on the original echo and had to be purchased separately.  the batter pack would have made the echo much more portable without losing wifi connection."
450,14,"i bought the original echo day one, and decided to upgrade to the ""new improved alexa""i am disappointed though,for all the hype i prefer the mark one,at least she hears me every time.the new one has issues as in, do not have the tv on when questioning her,and do not try to hide it behind foliage,she seems to have a problem hearing. i believe the add said she will be able to hear your commands better even when she is playing loud music. i guess that is true if you are standing right beside her.obviously she does respond in a similar manner to the mark one when she actually hears what has been said.looks and sounds much better than the mark one but i am still do not think its really that much improved.then again maybe i just got a bad one."
451,11,just received my 2nd generation echo is and not at all happy with the sound quality compared to the 1st generation.  we have 3 1st generation echo is and 5 dot is throughout the house and love them.  just unboxed the 2nd generation and immediately you can tell the clarity and depth of sound is just not there.  i will definitely be keeping my 1st gen is and returning these.
452,14,"i recommend the plus model over this model for sound quality. if you will be listening to a lot of music, pay the extra $ and get the plus. my boss has the plus model and it sounds significantly better than this version of the echo in my opinion. obviously the tradeoff is the taller footprint and higher price point of the plus.the size of this model is great. it has to be plugged in to work unless you buy a rechargeable base. the plug itself is a large block not a small cube or cord plug. the best sound comes out the front of the device instead of equally around the device. you will want it facing you for best sound. the sound overall is a little muddy with bass in my opinion. the speaker magnet makes this unit heavy compared to a rechargable bluetooth speaker.if the size and price work for your budget, this is a good quality buy. i wish i would have had the budget for the larger plius model for the higher sound quality."
453,14,"we love the amazon echo with alexa; i can not say enough good things about the echo and echo dot.  however...the multiroom audio feature is not yet ready for prime time.  we have 3 echos and 1 echo dot installed through-out our home.  we have an echo in the kitchen and one in the family room; about 30 feet apart.  in this configuration,  alexa has significant issues determining which echo device she is listening to for instructions.  this is true even when i am within 1 ft of the nearest echo. volume control is especially troublesome in multi room mode.  alexa is confused on what echo to perform the task with music requests.  also frustrating is the requirement to add the group name (ie downstairs network) to any verbal request that i wish played on all the echos in the group.  if i simply say, ""alexa, play (song/artist/station)"" w/o including the group name, she becomes confused & reverts back to the echo device that received my request..  she also get confused when adding a timer over music playing on mult room mode.we will discontinue using the multi room mode & await 3rd generation!"
454,14,"i purchased this for an early xmas gift for my father; he is 78 years old and not super tech savvy.  he loves it and stated the set up was much easier than he expected.  he connected it to a pandora music account and can control his tv with it (volume and channels, but not on and off just yet) and he seems to enjoy asking it just about anything.  i have zero personal experience with it, but now know if he can deal with the set up, then i certainly could, and so could just about anyone else.  there is one in my future, for sure."
455,14,"i really like the echo, but the one thing that i am rating 3 stars is the connectivity issues i am having. i have had to restart the echo a couple of times already, i have had to reset my connections, my router, and i am still having issues. i am not having issues with any of my other connected devices, smart tv, computer, phones, roku, etc. alexa works great, when it is connected but i am growing a bit impatient with all this loss of connectivity."
456,10,"the echo, she has made a fun addition into our family. very handy when making my shopping list or if i run out of something, just tell echo and she puts it on the list. added some fun history and kid friendly apps making it more family fun enjoyable. finding i use her more and more every day for playing music to finding out the weather, or just to hear the recent headlines. i have also notice it is making us more active. turning on the echo is cutting down on the tv time and definitely interacting more and playing games as a family. great buy for my home."
457,14,"whoever said this has improved sound over gen 1 needs a hearing exam. gen 1 sounds like a similarly sized ""insert expensive speaker"". gen 2 sounds like a loud phone in a shoebox. i have not noticed her understanding me better either. not that i care about that anyway. it is fun yelling at her. i am sticking with the real alexa."
458,14,"this thing is a toy, but what a fun one! i actually got a kick out of it because it would not play my granddaughter is music, but it plays mine just fine, and it will keep it up for as long as i like!it is also pretty good at answering general questions like converting celsius to fahrenheit which i need since i am horrid at conversion myself without a calculator. i expect to have a lot of fun with this thing, and it is also going to be useful since it does have a wide range of resources available on demand!"
459,14,"sounds great , works great. upgrade from an echo dot. now they both work in conjunction. bought my first fire tablet way back before there was an alexa. since then have bought a firestick, a dot, an echo, and three other fire tablets. everything is still working. bought two kids tablets, they are easily the best kids tablet around, and come with 2 year guarantee. highly suggest the echo, it does so many things, and is full of so much knowledge. easy 5 stars.can you live without this? sure but it makes life more fun with it."
460,14,"bought 8 of them including 2-show units and replaced a house full of bose soundtouch units. i get better coverage and the music sounds great at the volume i usually play it at when i am home. we have a smart home so this also controls all of our 5-baf fans throughout the house and all light switches, front door, garage ect. these units are amazing and so much more than a toy if used in a smart home. some say they sound better than the gen 1 echo is and i say they sound about the same but love the smaller profile and the way you can dress them up to match your room."
461,14,"i have first generation also, and i agree with others that the sound quality is not as good on the 2nd generation.  might as well get the dot.  i was planing on buying a couple more for whole house music, but i am going to wait and see what  better alexa speakers come out.  hopefully a higher end speaker is released by someone.functionality wise, it is great just like the first echo.  3 starts simply because it seems to be inferior to the first version due to sound quality, which is my main use case."
462,11,i was hesitant to order this after all the comments and reviews about poor audio quality.  i am happy to say that the latest software update has dramatically improved the sound quality.  it seems to produce a louder volume than the first generation.  i also hear a more full sounding bass.  some people may not agree with that depending on the type of music you are listening to.  most anything with a steady thumping bass will not sound as good as it would through a subwoofer.  most other types of music sound rich and full.  i enjoy old and new country music and it sounds great.
463,14,"new review - the update to the firmware amazon told me they were pushing fixed the issues i was having!! i am really glad they were able to fix it but i am more glad they actually called and talked about the feedback and did something to rectify it. really made me appreciate the company even more! thanks for fixing the issue and now i love my new echo again!!!original - i am confused by the ""improved audio"" statement. we have 3 first generations of this model and they all sound so much better. it is disappointing because i was so excited for this and it is not what i was expecting. i may return it."
464,14,"i love this device and am glad i got it.  it plays music, provides news, sets timers & alarms and so many other things i have yet to try.  i use a wheelchair so it is great when i forget to turn off a light and i already sat down on the sofa.  i do not have to get back up, i just tell alexa to turn the light off.  i see so many uses of this for the elderly or disabled that would be so beneficial.  just need to bring price down so they can afford it. the things i wish it could do better, is play my specific stations on pandora, it says it cannot do that.  it can play music from my pandora account, just not by station request. at times the connection to the smart plug that the lamp is connected to at times is lost so you have to wait for connection to reestablish."
465,14,"as an echo dot v1 user i pretty much knew what i was getting as far as voice control and how i would use it.  when i bought the echo dot i thought i would be using the voice abilities almost exclusively but it was so easy to just ask it to play a song or artist without having to turn on the full home system that i found myself regretting not getting the echo.  instead i bought an inexpensive bluetooth portable speaker and have been living with the slightly improved sound and flaky connection it brought.  with this release of the echo with smaller size and improved sound, i decided to upgrade.  for those in a situation like mine i highly recommend it!  i no longer worry about whether my alarms will come through audibly and the sound is a major improvement over the bluetooth speaker i was using.  i can not compare to the previous version of the echo but if you are looking for great audio (think great room sound, not home stereo) and you maybe have been thinking about upgrading your echo dot i say go for it!"
466,14,"bought this as a last minute gift idea for the santa family present.we absolutely love this! easy to set up with a smartphone and linked directly to my prime account.  volume is loud enough. music sounds great coming out of the echo.  we use it to find the weather for the day, news briefings usually from npr, movie times at local theatres, nearest coffee shop, etc.  we have it synched with our echo dot which i have in one of the kid bedrooms.  it also is linked to my prime account so i can have the echo play music in their room on the echo dot.  the only thing you can not do is stream music at the same time on the echo and the echo dot.  you can ask alexa to find something while at the same time playing music on the dot.  we may at a later date purchase the echo show. glad we purchased this"
467,14,"my daughter gave us one for christmas. i am 58, and she was a tad apprehensive giving it to us, but dads turned a little techy in the last 10 years (i have a better phone that the kids do, lol). that said, this thing is a blast. took about a hour to set up from my iphone with the app. i was calling them at 11 last night, just a voicemail and mom got the call from the kids this morning. ""what the heck was dad doing up so late?'just learning what it can do, and love when i can just say play whatever song i can think of."
468,14,this is money well spent on peace of mind...insisted mom get one as she is home alone and has had falls..most recently a compression fracture to the back and had just gotten back home. now should she need to call for help she can even if her phone is out of reach. and obviously if she is conscious..but it has given her a sense of security and me as well!!!!! pretty easy to set up..although the tablet alexa set up does not have the conversations icon..at least i could not find it so that was the challenge in setting up...otherwise amazing!!!
469,14,"i have been looking into some smart home devices and after doing some reading i decided on echo because it looks like a system with lots of devices and more mature of a product.i was not expecting much but primarily wanted something to turn tv , xbox, dvr and have some basic pause and play without having remotes which always find their way from living roomi ordered the echo, harmony hub and a land line home phone controller.echo took all but 5 minutes to setup and in 30 minutes i was making phone calls via home phone using echo. the audio is great, i can make calls and listen to music , just ask and alexia does it. the kids like asking for songs they like and very easy to use.the harmony hub took a little bit of reading to figure out what i wanted to use it for. as i said earlier i have a budget hisense tv with spectrum cable box and a high end nighthawk gaming router. after 2 hours i added xbox, cable box, apple tv , tv and tested all devices. activities are easy to setup and test, after done i synced harmony and asked alexia to discover devices and happy ever since!i plan on getting a fire tv as i think it will work better when using plex or netflix. apple tv used to be primary device and after switching to plex i did not want to pay 150.00 when i can buy 3 fire tvs for about same price that has plex, amazon and netflix and will be more friendly with alexia. the big plus with harmony is i can use app on iphone to fine tune selections in menus and type in text for movie searches. one thing i would like to see is to be able to create our own custome layout in remote app.i plan on using some lighting products, probably phillips so we can turn on basic household items.echo could use some fine tuning for help, for instance if i say alexia, plex, i wish easier to find out what to say by asking, sometimes i talk 5 or six times until i get right order<f0><u+009f><u+0099><u+0082> but for this smart stuff being out just a few years, it ought to make things easier when i get older and lazy !great products, easy to use without being a super geek."
470,14,"i love the echo, and i love alexa.  super responsive, super helpful, and the speakers are high quality.we also have the tap, and we have enjoyed it for over 2 years out by the pool.  however, when on touchless mode, the listening and response of the tap is a bit delayed - so the echo really exceeds expectations.  now i just have to figure out how to configure both with a name so i can play music throughout the house :)waiting for the price of the show to come down a bit, and then i will add that to our home, as well.  alexa, welcome home!!!"
471,14,loop on feature states it is enabled but fails to loop item playing.  ambient sound apps do not appear in the history. only songs played. appears that may be the issue.  please update the software!
472,14,"i am glad i returned the original echo.  little did i know, the second generation echo would soon be released. i bought it. like the looks. shorter. the 360 degree sound is awesome.  no matter where you are at in the house, you hear it exactly the same.  i have been playing 'soothing christmas music'. hardly turn on the tv. used to have it on from the time i got up until bedtime. now only at night. alexa is the best! friends enjoy teasing her when they come over. you can not go wrong investing in this sweet device."
473,14,"i am less impressed with it after my initial positive impression.  the sound has been okay but on one occasion alexas ""voice"" was breaking up.  not sure what that was about but it has not recurred so far. the program and the ""skills"" are a a bit buggy.  i installed the tide skill,  but it later told me that i needed to install that skill in order for alexa to answer, that is after it has been working for a few days.  alexa will not recognize commands fairly often and especially when the tv is on."
474,11,"just received the all-new echo, and was a little apprehensive because of the reviews about the sound quality.but i found the sound quality to be excellent with great clarity and improved bass as compared with the first generation echo.i highly recommend it!."
475,14,"we use this to listen to music in our home.  and boy do we love it. love the look of it as well.  the sound quality is crisp and clear.  we bought it during the christmas promotion and i would say for the quality you can not beat the price.  it is used almost all the time when we are home.  we have not used all of the functions yet. so far besides music we have used the dictionary, and my 7 year old enjoys asking it to pass gas, tell us the weather, tell jokes, make train sounds, and various other random things like asking, ""what does the fox say?""  we also play the daily jeopardy questions most days.  all around a family favorite.of note, i would say, is that this can be recognized by a augmentative communication device. that is our child who is non-verbal can use her commuterized communication device to ask alexa to play various music stations on amazon music.  we find this to be effective almost all of the time.  the computerized voice is not recognized unless it is within 5 feet of the echo. i think perhaps because it is trained to listen for human voices.  that being said, it still does recognize the communication device, and that is important to us. it gives our child the freedom to request whatever music she wants whenever she wants it without us having to help her. so kudos to echo for doing that and giving her independence to use her voice."
476,14,"love my new echo! i had tried buying a similar offbrand item since it was cheap and it was a disaster. decided to finally invest in this product so i can enjoy my music in my home without having to use headphones and so it is loud enough to hear without having to carry my phone into every room. i did not know what to expect since i¡¯ve never owned anything like this but i really like it! set up was easy, sound is really high quality. i live in a small apartment but the sound carries well throughout the apartment. right now i¡¯m using the bluetooth capabilities to listen to music but will probably venture into pandora or iheartradio for this device, since i like to keep background noise for my dog when i¡¯m not home. alexa is a very cool feature that i¡¯ve been having a lot of fun with. she responds with no lag and actually can hear me from the living room (the living room is located as soon as you walk into my door, my bedroom is on the opposite side of apartment, so the distance is pretty great). a friend of mine has the echo 1st gen but i decided to go with the 2nd gen after reading the good reviews about the sound quality. there is so much more i could say about how great this product is, 10/10 would recommend!"
477,14,"omg! amazing! why did i wait so long to get this? wow it understands my voice so well. it hears me from any direction in a normal speaking level or lower. i hooked it up to the etekcity plugs and they work perfectly. you will love it and have fun discovering all the things she can do for you. i also have the google and it does not hear me as well. i have to repeat myself and say things louder too much with that one. i find alexa to be much better than google.<u+00a0>all-new echo (2nd generation) with improved sound, powered by dolby, and a new design - heather gray fabric"
478,14,"excellent, product. i love it.i had problems getting it to work. i had to call tech help to come and upload it. he also had to get it going through my phone instead of pc. which the cost for that was as much as the product itself. a little dissappointed i had to pay twice as much as advertised.except for the added cost, since i could not figure it out, even though i followed all directions you sent with it. troubleshooting did not help either. but, everything works great now."
479,14,"i am sure it will get better as they develop it. does not pick up as well in my apt. as i had hoped, but good enough once you learn how to speak to it. would like more options like voice changing ability or different cue names than the four provided. the app is decent, but the ai is still a little lacking from what i thought it would be. however, i would like to ability to quickly erase my demand history with one click instead of one at a time.all-around, a fun product that i know will become better as the technology increases and our concern over what information gathered about us lessens with amazons almighty power."
480,14,"while the sound is better than the dot, everything else about this device is inferior. i placed this one in my living room because i assumed it was better than the smaller dots, but it can barely hear me from across the room, including when my two dots in two different rooms can hear and respond.i have been using alexa for a few months now, and while i like controlling my switches/plugs and thermostat with voice commands, i hate that i have to constantly repeat myself. there are also frequent connection issues in general, at least once a week, she is ""having problems understanding.""i was recommending alexa to everyone, but i can not anymore. it is just too frustrating dealing with the glitches."
481,14,"this is our third echo device and it works as elegantly as our 1st gen unit while offering much better sound quality than our dot.  this 2nd gen replaced the echo dot which had resided in our casita (small unattached house) and is now used, among other things, as a hands-free intercom.  the dot was relocated to the main house for functional things like lighting control, alarms and messaging.  the 2nd gen echo setup and integration was very easy taking only minutes to complete.  performance is excellent using our dual-band wireless router which is centrally located in the main house - no need for additional wifi range extenders.  music quality is also pretty good for such a relatively small device.  we are happy."
482,14,"update 11/05/17: i have been working with the echo gen 2 for a day with the software update that is supposed to improve the audio quality. i have been testing both alexa voice and music, and while the software update does slightly improve the audio quality for music, it still sounds very constrained and about as good as a small low end bluetooth speaker. audio quality for the alexa voice is still pretty muddy compared to the echo gen 1. i am returning the six echo gen 2 devices that i bought and replacing them with echo gen 1 devices. i notice that amazon limits the quality of echo gen 1 devices they allow you to buy, so if you are thinking of swapping out gen 1 for gen 2, you probably want to buy the gen 1 devices soon.i feel i gave the gen 2 device a fair shake, but the hardware and the software are just not of high enough quality compared to the gen 1 device. it is too bad because i really like the form factor and the fact that you can get different skins for the device. but, my primary use of the echo devices is for alexa voice control and response, and i need the voice to be clear, and the echo gen 1 (and the echo dot gen 2) provide a crisp, clear alexa voice. i listen to music on sonos so the music playback quality of an echo device is of secondary importance for me.i bought six of these to replace some echo dots and one echo gen 1. i am planning on returning all six, after having configured and used three of them for a few days. the sound quality of this device is horrible. i use my echo for home control, flash briefings, dad jokes, etc... and not much for music (i control sonos with alexa for music). the echo gen 2 has a very muddy sounding alexa voice, and the music sounds very constrained. i have read that amazon pushed a software update to select customers to ""fix"" the audio issues but i am not sure that i am willing to gamble that this will actually work to improve the sound. let is see if amazon reaches out to me and offers me the update in the next few days before i return these. i also do not understand what benefits the dolby technology gives to the echo gen 2, i was expecting tremendously great sound with the dolby technology but was sorely dissapointed.the package also claims that the microphone array is much improved but in my experience, the echo gen 1 units do just fine in all the rooms of my house where i have them.i bought six echo gen 1 units to replace the six echo gen 2 units that i am considering returning."
483,14,"alexa is a very interesting product. nice looking and sleek but she is about as dumb as a rock. i guess that is the bing search engine. i always said i would rather be totally ignorant than look up anything on bing. she also blurts out things whenever the ""spirit"" moves her. she will just suddenly say ""how would i know the answer to that"" or "" i can not answer that"", without any prompting, usually around the witching hour. i had an echo dot before this alexa and the dot was faster and worked better, and kept it is mouth shut most of the time. she is fun to yell at, good thing they left out the tear ducts or i would end up in hr. it is definitely a cool product and the speakers are great, just dumb and annoying.....m"
484,14,i have the older echo and it was working perfectly.  i decided to buy the new one and swap with the old one at home.  set up was not as easy as advertised and the new one did not recognize the skills the old one had in use.  and the new one would not work alone; only when the old one was turned on.  called support and they were puzzled by this issue.  i think this is a great product and we use it a lot for a variety of things.  i am sure amazon will figure out the bugs and the product will improve.  it looks awesome and it is much smaller.
485,14,"definitely an awesome way to start up your smart home! i love the sound that comes out of something so small. stereo sound with very nice bass response! not too hard to set up either once you download the alexa app, it pretty much walks you through the process. but once it is hooked to your phone and wifi you kinda got figure things out on your own from there but it is not bad once you start playing around with the app. also, super easy to hook up to wifi plugs. one thing to know though is that the alexa app will not hook up to plugs and switches on its own, you have to download a separate app that is for the specific smart plug or switch brand that you buy. it will tell you in the instructions that come with he product you buy. but it is super easy to do and once you¡¯ve downloaded that app, alexa will find the plug or switch on her own and walk you through the set up which literally takes two minutes! i bought four plugs with my alexa to start off with, it is been awesome to control lights with just the sound of my voice or the push of a button if i¡¯m not home! i especially love that my wife can cut the lights on if she is coming home late and i¡¯m not home. she and our children dont have to walk into a dark house! i am excited about adding other smart plugs and switches! i also love the fact that i can call people with alexa, i just tell her who to call and she does it. i never have to pick up a my phone. i just talk to them through her. once she is hooked up to your phone she knows your contacts. definitely an awesome product and for what your getting, an awesome price!"
486,14,"great sound for a small package. i¡¯m not blasting music or an audiophile, but these sound more than good enough to me.i had two echos and a few dots before, but i really love these the most for general use throughout the house. i liked the look and smaller size of these much more than the original. what really made me purchase these was the update amazon released for multi-room music. finally,  i could set up the audio capabilities i¡¯ve wanted the echo to perform for so long. it is still not perfect (somewhat limited in that you can only assign a speaker to one group), and if you play using groups, you can only play one group at a time - so basically i have not found a way to have the flexibility of groups set up but also have option to say ¡°play everywhere¡±. seems it is one or the other."
487,0,"alexa does not understand a lot you have to say.  you have to be clear and slow but not too slow for her to get it.  you also have to know and say a specific order or words. also, she is not programmed for internet searches that are not above level 1/basic like comparing something. i guess i expected more from her."
488,14,"i was very impressed with the sound quality of this unit. i have echo dots and wanted to see what to see how the upgraded unit would perform.i like the cloth exterior, but do not know how it will hold up with time.it just sits on the counter. i do not know how it will take dusting over an extended time.everything works like the dot.set up was easy, just like the other devices.i just wish there was a way to make the ""power supply"" thinner."
489,14,"bought for my husband for christmas. it has afforded him many hours of entertainment (along with a little frustration) in attempting to link his extensive music and movie collection on his computer to an alexa app so he can tell 'her' to play anything that strikes his fancy. from my daily 'alexa, what is the temperature?' to his 'alexa, play inna gadda da vida' (because he knows it annoys me - another favorite entertainment), our echo gets lots of use. i love being able to ask when the next airing of my favorite tv shows will be during this time of unsettled schedules due to olympics and awards shows, too. we have not even begun to tap the uses, but we are planning on adding echo dots to other rooms in the house."
490,14,"after months of use... when it counts... i hate alexa!  this product feels beta all of the time. failing when activation word is used, and starting when unasked every single day. i find my myself swearing at the top of my lungs constantly at ""alexa"" to shut up, repeating what i had stated five times already in a row, or trying to figure out how what i said could possibly have to do with the result i am getting.i made a massive mistake in these purchases. i smart things hub, phillips hue, security system, etc. alexa can barely answer weather questions (the worst ever/inaccurate) let alone turn lights on, or turn off the blaring alarm that was tripped accidentally.god, i hate alexa!"
491,14,"i received my echo today and i have not been able to stop. the product told me she had an update about 15 minutes after booting up, and that took all of 45 seconds. the speaker sounds wonderful, and it fills the room. it is very responsive and looks great on my desk. also, alexa happens to be a bit of a comedian. i will be buying dots for my whole house. wonderful first experience with ai. amazon, you have got me hooked."
492,14,"i bought this for my korean parents who i thought might benefit from some of the lower-tech capabilities (e.g., asking about the weather). however, alexa could not really understand their slightly accented english (and for that matter, could not translate words from english to korean, because it is not capable of korean yet). it was a nice thought, but i ended up returning.ps: if i had bought this for myself, it would have been to listen to music -- and having used a friend is google home before, i will say that the echo pales in comparison in terms of sound quality / depth."
493,14,"compared to the 1st gen echo, the 2nd gen sounds noticeably better. and it does ""hear"" better when you talk to it. i can speak in a very low voice now. music sounds clear even at low levels. the software service does so much now, it is impossible to recap. i use the smart home feature to tell alexa to turn my bedroom lamp on and off. i listen to general and tech news from multiple sources. there are options for a music service. it is very entertaining to ask alexa off the wall questions. what it can tell you is eye opening. i just asked it ""what is the alamo"" and got a lengthy historical overview.  fun, informative, practical, entertaining ...... the cost of an echo pales beside the value of the alexa service."
494,14,"my husband & i kicked off our alexa experience with a 2nd gen dot in mid-december. it was fun learning the various things we can do with alexa (note: we did not purchase the dot specifically as a speaker). we also purchased a few companion products (wemo plugs, philips hue bulbs, vivint home security, firesticks) and enabled the corresponding smart home skills. we¡¯ve also enabled quite a few additional skills over the last 2+ months. about the time that we started listening to music on our dot, we decided that we liked the idea and were having fun with alexa, enough that it would be worth it to purchase another device so we could have one on each of the upper 2 floors of our house. we purchased the echo (sandstone fabric) in early january. the first thing we noticed is that the sound quality with music on the echo is significantly better than the dot. we¡¯ve had no issues with either device not registering our commands, in fact, both devices routinely pick up our commands from one room away. that said, our house is fairly quiet, not much competing noise. these days, in addition to the smart home skills, we frequently stream a local radio station or pandora on our echo and find the sound quite acceptable! we¡¯re not musicians but we do enjoy having music on, in the background, throughout the day. overall, we continue to find new, sometimes interesting and helpful uses for alexa & our alexa devices. also, we are very happy with the sandstone fabric, it has a nice, clean, neutral look."
495,14,"i truly do not understand all the negative reviews here...unless it is attributable to the before vs. after firmware update. my echo is running the latest update and it sounds great. i also have a first generation echo and spent the last 20 minutes comparing their sound when playing music. honestly, the second generation sounded at least as good as the first. the midrange/treble sounded even better than on the first generation, with voices more distinct, less muddled. the bass was probably slightly better on the first generation, but not so much that i would notice except when doing a direct comparison. of course, both of them are miles better than the dot.i also prefer the size and style of the new echo; less obtrusive in my living room.imo, if you are thinking of getting an echo, do not be deterred by the bad reviews here."
496,11,love it.  i have the original and love the sound quality on both.  the newer version is shorter so not as noticeable. love being able to do so many things just by talking.
497,9,my family really enjoys the echo in our home. i also have a echo dot and we are able to use both as an intercom. the sound it great. my partner mainly uses the echo to listen to music and the speakers in the echo are really good and we never have a problem. the only time the sound is not so great is when it is used as an intercom and that may be due to the volume being low on the upstairs echo dot. we love it so much that we are going to buy the echo for our children is room.
498,0,"love this but the technology needs work.  sometimes works; sometimes not.  alexa reminds me of my husband - selective hearing. she is probably telling all her echo techno friends that i am a nag and i yell at her sometimes.  i do not have an accent. i do not mumble. also, still trying to set up a amart hub device after a few days - not so easy.  still, it is useful when it does work for things like weather forecasts, playing music, spelling, news briefings and recipes, etc."
499,14,"i purchased the original, then three dots and many other items that work in this echo system.  bought this for another room.  the sound is muck improved over the original.  the look is nicer.  it blends in better and is smaller.  this is by far the best echo i have to date.  if all you need is something to trigger the lights or read the news or are using an external speaker get the dot.  if sound quality matters and you are not attaching an external speaker this is the one to get."
500,14,"i¡¯ve had my first echo for about 2 weeks now. i¡¯m still learning all the bells and whistles but it is a nifty gadget. it works great with my nest thermostat through voice commands. the news weather briefing in the morning i enjoy listening to while eating breakfast. pandora is easy to use but i¡¯m discovering amazon really wants you to sign up for their music service. just yesterday when i got home a different light color was flashing and i discovered it was telling me my item i just ordered, from amazon, had been delivered so that was helpful.as smart home technology improves and becomes cheaper the echo and alexa will only get better. it is also good at asking general questions. the app is clunky as others noted and reason for 4 stars but i¡¯m sure amazon will improve on this."
501,14,"i have a 91 yr old mother living with me. my son bought this so in case i had to run out to the pharmacy or any quick trips, mother is able to call me, him or anyone, if she is lonely or needs help. my dog is fascinated with alexa, especially when i ask alexa to bark. but she watches it every time it talks and cocks her head to the side to listen in wonderment. it has given me so much information also. and since mother is blind, she has to ask it the weather all the time. our biggest problem is she often forgets alexa is name!! i love my alexa and have had so much enjoyment out of it already. she reminds me of my doctor appointments, always responds when i say good morning with a cheerful message, will tell me a funny joke when i ask, and is just full of info!"
502,14,"cannot recommend these echos enough!  the sound is incredible.  you will feel the base.  we bought these for our daughters to replace the echo dots they had on their night stands.  they loved the dots, but always connected to a bluetooth speaker for better sound.  this eliminated the need for another speaker.  the sound from these is absolutely awesome.  the girls love them.  we have 3 now and we could not be happier.oh and they look great too!!important:  you can trust my advice;  i have been using echos since the pre-release of the very first one.  we now have 10 in our home, including the original, the spot, dots, and these.  the sound quality from these is better than any other.  if style and sound matter, this is your echo."
503,14,"i bought the original echo and loved it (love it still) and then went on to purchase multiple echo dots. when the 2nd generation came out i was eager for another powerful speaker like the original echo, but i have been disappointed. it has caused problems with other dots connecting to the everywhere group. the speaker has some significant reverb, and it consistently glows red saying it can not understand me now despite being in the middle of the wireless mesh in this house. very disappointed in this next generation, so will be returning it.  hope i can get a 1st generation still"
504,14,i do not understand many of the reviews from people who think this is a replacement to a bose speaker.  the sound of excellent given its many other functions.  you do not know how badly you need this in your life until you own one.  we just ordered two dots as well. alexa is a great addition to the family.
505,14,"this was our way of dipping our toe in the home-assistant pool. we are pretty impressed with how well alexa responds to commands. we use our little network of echos and echo dots to control everything from our security system to our insteon smart switches and lighting and it works great. in my opinion, if you are a prime member this is the home-assistant for you. i am also a prime music member, which adds another element of usefulness. a few things we use it for:- listening to whole-house music ""alexa play music by budos band everywhere"" and there you have it, all of the echos are playing the same music!- turning our smart home lighting on and off- it is our alarm clock. we finally ditched the horrible sounding and looking 30 year old alarm clock- alexa ""how many cups are in a quart?"" instant answer!- ""alexa, ask harmony to turn the tv on""-  building a shopping list when you run out of things, instead of trying to remember what you need later in the week ""alexa, add 13 gallon trash bags to my shopping cart""the sound from the echo is pretty good too. i would not use it to replace a good stereo receiver with speakers, but when i just want some background music while i am working around the house, it is great! i plan to buy a couple more echos in the future."
506,14,"not being tech savvy, i rode the fence with the echo. i thought it was mostly for kids. in fact, i purchased one for all of my grandkids for christmas.  finally, i bought one for myself  and downloaded the app.  i love this product. i do not sleep well, and it is such a blessing to ask alexa to play sleep sounds.  i was amazed at how easy it is to set up. every morning i listen to the news and weather report. one of my grandsons was over the other day and i was able to show him some of the things the echo can accomplish and he was excited to set his up when he got home.  good grief, now i am considering purchasing smart light bulbs.  where will it all end? if only alexa could cook my dinner, i would be complete."
507,14,"i rarely write review. but as an owner of the first generation echo as well as the echo tap and a few echo dot i am offended that amazon has put out such an inferior ""improved"" version. the sound quality for music is no where near as good as the original echo. i am being generous and giving it two stars because it does have the awesome functionality of all the entire echo family but this is another instance were the ""new"" model does not live up to the original. i am returning mine in the morning for a refurbished first generation."
508,14,"we have 4 echo dots and 1 gen1 echo. i just purchased 3 more 2nd gen echoes. even with the software update the 2nd gen echoes fall short on sound quality. i am far from an audio expert but these units do not sound as good as the gen 1 echo. i put the gen 1 and gen 2 side by side and used echo as wake work for gen 1, alexa as wake work for gen 2. i went back and forth having each play a song to compare. gen 2 has better bass but not as good overall. frankly both sound pretty good to me but the claim of better sound in gen 2 misses the mark. i recommend buying gen 1. i am thinking about returning and buying gen 1 units."
509,14,"i love the device but the instructions are a little lacking. no where does it tell you what the ""dot"" on the top of the device is for & i actually called an 800 number provided that was given to me by amazon. all they were interested in was selling me a network security contract that i had no need for! they told me that if i did not purchase one they could not connect me to the internet!!! well a friend of mine who is a tech guy said that was a scam & he helped me get my echo connected with no problem! you might want to check out these sites that are supposed to be woking for you because they are really working for themselves!"
510,14,"for my 78 year old grandfather who missed the boat on the internet, this is awesome. he can ask it most things and it will answer. my two complaints are1) you have to be specific about how you phrase questions. asking it too long of a question gets an ""i am not sure"" answer.2) my second and biggest pet peeve, which i am actually a bit angry about, is it only plays spotify if you pay for a subscription. what is that garbage? why do i not have the option to just listen to the commercials like on every other device, including google home. why does google have this function and the echo does not?? it is honestly inexcusable. i would buy more echo is for myself and other people if it had this functionality."
511,14,"i had been wanting the echo but had not purchased onemy kids bought me one for xmas, but it was a sharper imagine and it was great the first few days then it started talking randomly sometimes it worked sometimes it did not. i had wanted the amazon echo so i ordered it. what a difference it is fantastic very  fast response i love it i have not found anything i do not like about it as a matter fact i liked it so much i purchased the dot for my bedroom.  at night when i go to bed i start playing music and just tell it to stop playing in 30 minutes and it does.  it does everything as advertised to do and a lot more the sound quality is super, amazon is great and did a wonderful job with the echo"
512,14,"the echo is really helpful for my day to day activities. i think it has great sound quality and voice recognition. i like that you can enable skills for your needs.the only cons:it only works with wifi, and it has to be plugged in for it to work.at first at had trouble connecting it to my university wifi because it does not connect to peer-to-peer networks, and then i registered the mac address and connected to a wifi network specifically for devices that can not connect to p2p networks."
513,14,"alexa, write this review...nah, did not think that would work. guess i will have to do it myself.overall, it is great. sound fills the room well, although it can get a bit distorted at higher levels. she is pretty good at recognizing voices. she picks up and understands my 3 year old daughter. i have it connected to two smart outlets and being able to control my lights via alexa is great.having it connected to my audible account let is me relax with a book reading, and i can jam out in the shower because it is linked into my amazon music and spotify account.i ordered some surge protectors by tell her to order them. did not need to pick up my phone it get on the computer. 2 days later, i got surge protectors.the only downside is that if any commercial for alexa comes on (and there is a few on hulu) it will pick up the command from the tv."
514,10,"i love my echo. it is all i expected and more. we even brought it on vacation with us so we could get weather updates, play games, and get answers to trivia questions. it is also a great speaker<u+2014>plays my phone is playlists via bluetooth and plays my favorite radio station plus i pay $3.99 a month to get just about any songs i want.  we do not have smart appliances yet, but i¡¯m sure that will be cool in the future. i highly recommend the echo! alexa is the bomb!"
515,14,"speaker works well - thought i would use it more, but unless all your books are kindle and audible, this can not be used. for example library books, or hoopla books. also, unless the song your looking for is pretty popular, plan on repeating your request over and over again for alexa. we finally resorted to the app to choose music because alexa is pretty worthless. i really wanted to like this but unless you have a smart home, i am afraid alexa might just gather dust."
516,14,"initially, i had issues with audio quality but after a software update, it sounds great. it is rich and clear without getting muddy at high volumes like the original echo did. the microphones are also vastly improved, especially when things are noisy. i had to shout at my old echo when i had music playing at high volumes and that is no longer the case. it all comes together to make a solid package. i miss the volume dial a little but otherwise, i could not ask for anything more, especially at the lower price."
517,14,"love this gadget!  setup was fairly easy.  the echo can be connected through your wi-fi or can be connected to your phone.  if you do connect the echo through your phone, notifications coming through your phone will interrupt music that is playing through the echo.  if you want uninterrupted music, etc., leave the echo connected only through your wi-fi.  it works best if you have amazon prime with music unlimited.  if you do have this service, you can ask alexa to play a particular song, artist, genre of music, ask her your local weather, etc.  if you have devices that connect to alexa such as smart plugs for lamps, etc., you can program alexa to turn lights on and off with your voice.  you can operate these smart devices once they are linked to alexa using your voice.i also stream video using an amazon fire stick on my tv and it uses alexa to find movies, applications, etc.  this makes your voice a powerful tool.  when connected to your phone, she can send messages, order stuff for you on amazon (how convenient), give you a recipe, etc.  the list goes on and on...i also found that alexa quickly understood my questions.  using an alexa app on your smartphone, you can give amazon feedback as to whether she understood what you were asking for.  this helped greatly with voice recognition.  she certainly does better than the voice recognition device i have in my car.they are adding new applications for this device all of the time and you will get emails from amazon echo notifying you of her new capabilities."
518,14,"unhappy. i did not want to write a review until i spent time with my dot and 3 echo towers.  i have had my echo family for two months now.  while i love the sound, the speakers are just perfect for my room sizes, i am underwhelmed as my echos are no longer working correctly when i play music on them. they cut out randomly, solo or during multi room play.  i have registered/deregistered; factory reset; deleted and rebuilt every option that was recommended to me in echo facebook groups and on the self-help alexa device support pages.  i have contacted amazon support directly, waiting on a reply.  if you do decide to get the echo system make sure to get the protection plan. i did not."
519,9,we baught this one and the echo plus. we love it. the philips hue light bulb came with it. we screwed the light bulb into the lamp and asked alexa to detect all devices and that was it! it was so easy! we are lookin into more devices to transition our home into a smart home. our home is layed out where our bedroom is on the main living floor. we still need another echo device so we can utilize features in other parts of the home. we are just learning about alexa but we love her!
520,14,"i did not think i would enjoy it as much as i do. got it as a gift and i love this thing. the sound quality and loudness is impressive. also, this gen has more microphones which enable alexa to hear you even at full volume. my friend has the gen1 and he loves it aside from that one set back."
521,11,"the mics are better, and that is the only improvement.  the sound, even with the latest firmware, is maybe on par or worse than the original echo.  it sounds bass heavy and muffled like it is submerged in water.  responsiveness in carrying out commands is also randomly slow at times compared to the cheaper dot and echo, on the order of seconds rather than fraction of a second.  this ¡°updated¡± echo feels like a beta product and predecessor to the original."
522,11,"had high hopes at a better sound as advertised over the original echo.  i was unfortunately disappointed.  while the higher frequencies are a little more crisp the bass response is not as good as the original echo.  in fact, i unretired my original echo.  hopefully the 3rd generation will bring some real improvements.  would have preferred some real sound improvements over the lower price."
523,14,"bought as a gift for my 'rents, they love it.  it is heavy and has great build quality.  the app for setting it up kinda sucks, so be patient and let it do it is thing,  everything will work out.  almost rage quit while working with the app, but i will say again, be patient and it work."
524,14,"i have only had it hooked up for a few hours and i love it.  the speaker is of very good quality.  i was thinking i may need to get some fancy bluetooth speakers to add to it and if i do anything i would just add another echo - especially when they run a sale you can not beat it and then alexa is available in that area as well.  very happy with it.  and with prime you get free music and can say alexa play ""bob is playlist"" and it does."
525,14,"i actually won this echo.  while i have seen them at my friend is house, i really did not understand what it was.  i would also like to note that i am technologically challenged. lol  having said that, i mainly use it to play music while i am cooking dinner which is nice.  i also sometimes ask for the weather forecast or alexa is opinion on stuff (which not much but she likes the seahawks - you are forewarned lol).  amazon will also send you emails (not sure if they are daily or a few times a week) where you can ask alexa different things you had not thought of which i like.  also!  the best feature so far - it can find your phone for you (as long as the ringer is on).  love that."
526,14,i have spent a week listening to the original echo and now have had this for a couple days.  neither are audophile quality of course but plenty good for what it is.  i love having this thing around; it is like a personal assistant that has a one time price of $99.  it is hard to imagine how a product at this price point could be much better.
527,14,"works fine for smart home devices.  sounds fine. one of the reasons i purchased was to let it play music all day. unfortunately, music cuts off without warning and does not restart itself. there are no user diagnostics. customer support, which is extremely responsive, told me that it was a problem with my wifi (it works just fine) or perhaps a ¡°technical glitch¡± and i should restart the device. it is great when it works, but right now it is not solid enough for dependability. i expected better from amazon."
528,10,"this is the most awesome device i have. the news, weather and sports all read to me in the morning, plus all the skills its has. this is a must have for people who are on the go in the morning, and the device is wonderful to come home  too. keeps me updated on things i want to know, including the stock market. with the music unlimited, i have the best music at my command. amazon hit it out of the park with this."
529,14,"same great alexa but adds excellent sound quality.  the first thing i noticed was the dynamic sound it added, very nice bass and clear mids and highs with the additon of spacious 360 degree sound.  connects easily and great addtion to my echo dot.  same quality as the original echo dot. i now use echo dot in another room and the 2nd gen echo on my night stand.  i plan on buying another echo for my livingroom and kitchen.  the price is right for the improved sound.  to get the same sound from my echo dot i connect it to another small amplifier.  just wish the new echo had its on power source but, no issue, i will just kick out $$ for the portable battery; but it would have made the upgrade a fantastic one."
530,14,"i have bunch of echo dots and i wanted to get a bit better sound for my bedroom, so i got the echo. i was very disappointed from the sound of the echo, and i could here mostly bass. it is way to boomy and if you have it close to a wall it gets even worst - no way to adjust the bass. to be honest the dots sound better then the echo, and if you really need better sound, i would recommend to get echo and connect it via bt to your favorite speaker."
531,14,"i¡¯m very happy with the 2nd generation echo. for the price and value you can do a lot. the reponsiveness is quick and accurate. the sound quality is not the best however it is not bad, there is the option to connect via bluetooth or wire to external speakers for better sound quality. as an iphone user i have all my music through itunes which is not something that works well with alexa, i¡¯m hoping there will be a solution to that in the near future. since i live in a heavily congested city my real time traffic news is very important so that i can plan my commute, echo does not yet have a very reliable app or skill that can help me with this. i can get a basic direction and drive time from echo but you can get that from your smart phone just by speaking to it. there is a lot of potential with echo and i am already trying to automate a lot of things around the house and hope that in the near future i can add more products that work well with echo."
532,14,"ah alex echo!a great companion.creates lists,plays amz music,checks weather,will teach you languages,plays games with you,tracks pkgs (amz ord is),set is reminders, alarms (weekly or within 24hrs) & ""to do lists"".can create ""shopping lists"" (amz or otherwise).and so much more!a lil nosy, a lil buggy, a lil silly!but over all well worth it too."
533,14,"i do not know what gen 1 sounded like so i can not compare, but the sound from this speaker is really good for what it is.  we love being able to just choose whatever music we want to hear, whether it be a specific type, artist, or year.  love the timer feature too, i listen while i am cooking and sometimes need more than just the oven timer.  getting a quick synopsis of the news is nice as well weather updates. a little apprehensive about the ability of it to record everything going on in the house or the ability of others to connect to it, i know i have to accept for that to happen, but it just makes me nervous so when it is not in use it is unplugged.  i also turned off the ability of it to make purchases.  overall we are really enjoying it, and are considering purchasing a dot to travel with. my husband is having fun asking alexa silly questions, i assume (hope!) that novelty will wear off soon.  it is nice to ask a question and get an immediate answer and not strain my eyes looking at the ipad."
534,14,"can not believe i did not buy one sooner!!  took a bit to set up the app and house with the outlets and other devices....but once i figured it out, easy breezy!!i¡¯ve had a couple issues but they have been minor and think that maybe wifi caused the glitches.  alexa went silent once and had an issue turning on specific lights throughout the house. but they were one and done and caused no issues.  i like my email updates on what she can do now and constantly test it as i learn more and more of the systems capabilities.now setting up family members houses with all that i¡¯ve done, and can not wait to see all the other full home devices that are available!!if you¡¯ve been hesitant as i was, get over it and just order...i am so impressed with this thing and the neighbors are envious and even asked me to help them set up theirs when they order!!"
535,14,"sound quality is great.  linking the device to an iphone is easy.  however, linking the device to ring, digital life, smart tvs, and getting it to interface with my iphone (in order to get it to do simple tasks including but not limited to: call so-and-so; text so-and-so) is not easy.  the device is not as user friendly as i wish it were.  it is lovely that it plays music; however it rarely is able to answer questions other than what is the weather.  it is not all that it is cracked up to be; rather a disappointment at this stage.  we hope it becomes easier to pair with various devices and that it will be able to do more in the future.  currently, i do not recommend this product."
536,14,"i love, love love, love, love music!  i did not think i could enjoy music anymore than i already do.  i was soooo wrong!  alexa puts the shoo-bop sha wadda wadda yippity boom de boom chang chang changitty chang sha-bop into not only my music but my whole life!!!  she not only delivers my music on a dime, she is a party animal, a housekeeper (if you have alexa you must get the plugs that operate your lights) a know it all (in a very lovely way) and is on task 150% of the time.  i have two alexas and am thinking of getting a third (i live in a multi level townhouse) because i can not bear to be in a room alexa is not in!  i highly recommend - if i could give this 20 stars i would!"
537,14,"wife loves it, plays all her music on it. grandkids also like it, they really gave it a workout last weekend( if alexa was human she would probably told them to sit down & shut up!) setup is simple & she seems to work well, sometimes answers when she hears alexa mentioned on tv.have also added a smart plug and a smart switch, the smart plug setup was a little confusing at first and took a while but the smart switch was installed and working in less than a half hour since kasa was already installed."
538,10,"sound is soooo much better than the echo dot. fiancee loves this as she enjoys listening to music in the morning when she is getting ready. have another one that i will be putting out on our deck when it warms up a bit.  very happy with the echo system period. this is the 4th one we have put in the house. love the ability to get quick info - ""hey alexa - what is the temperature?"" while deciding what to wear.  so many options available with alexa."
539,14,"i have had my echo and echo dot for about  10 days now and am enjoying them a lot. the integration between the devices is seamless and i am amazed at all the things i am able to do with these devices. the application on my iphone is a bit quirky and hard to get used to, however the more i use it the better i get at it and the more i am able to do.  it is a great app but not well documented or easy to use  i¡¯m giving five stars because the devices themselves are absolutely awesome."
540,14,"i purchased this for my brother-in-law who has als (lou gehrig is disease), and thought this would help him so much since his motor functions are almost gone. he still has his voice at this time, so a lot of independence has been taken away from him by this disease. so after reading up on all the products alexa offers and can be paired with, i thought what a great asset for him. something to allow him to turn on lights by voice, change his tv channel, get weather forcast, read a book to him, call family hands free, etc. the hands free is what has sold me. he has gotten it hooked up and he was so excited when he called be yesterday on it. it was just such a wonderful feeling that maybe, just maybe this gave him some independence back. when you are used to that and it gets taken away from you, it is devastating. his condition will only get worse, but hopefully even if this helps just for a few weeks or months it is worth it to him and our family. also he lives 12 hrs away from us. this allows him not to have someone get his phone for him or anything. so great. i am so appreciative of the technology that is available. i hope after ordering more wireless plugs, light bulbs and other accessories he can do so much more. i just can not explain how cruel this disease is and hopefully there will be a cure one day. i had an aunt with it and she lost the battle after 12 years. hopefully they will find something soon that will heal him. i highly recommend these items to people with mobility problems. if you have a landline even better, then alexa can dial 911. i wish he had a landline, but i have had all family members program his local 911 agency phone number in their phone, so he can call any of us and we can call them. i am a 911 dispatcher and this was the only way i could see to make this work without a land line.!!!! i got this and the dot to allow him to have more access throughout the house."
541,14,"i like the music and sometimes use timer, weather, news briefs, etc.  the music has a little too much bass for some songs for my preference and there is no way to control that.  sometimes i can not hear alexa because i had turned the music down.  alexa does not know a lot of things that i thought would be available to it on internet.  i am still getting used to it so have not tried everything.  some of her answers are quite humorous.  for me it is more a toy at this point.  may like to try the compatible thermostat at a later date.  i use a different ""wake"" word then ""alexa"".  i would like to be able to have more choice in the ""wake"" word.  also, if you ask the date and time and try to ask another question after that you have to say the wake word again.  it might be useful to have it not turn off immediately after it gives a reply because if you do ask ""what should we talk about"" you are not going to get a conversation, but for the price it is a fun toy.  should not i be able to give feedback on alexa?"
542,14,"i love this device.  alexa is not always perfect on hearing instructions, but she does very well, and can be taught so many things to do.  it is a little bit novelty at first, but then you use the music, weather, and other things more than you think you would.  the look is great--the echo blends in on the fireplace mantle completely--you would never know it was an electronic device except for the power cord.  even my wife, who did not want a smart home assistant device, uses it regularly.  the sound is also good, although i did not have one of the originals to compare it with.  i have now purchased an echo dot for my son, and i look to buy a spot for my bedroom.  well done, amazon."
543,10,"we just hooked up our alexa two days ago and we are having fun already.  we are just learning what all we can ask alexa, but she is already becoming a family member.  ha ha  we have gotten interesting information from her, asked stupid questions, been told jokes, gotten the weather report, our schedule, sports scores, started a grocery list.  we love her already.  now....what to buy her for christmas??  i think a thermostat to go with her - that will be nice."
544,14,"i was dubious, but it was on special.  for the first few weeks, i was getting frustrated because no matter how many times i ""calibrated"" to my voice, it seemed she could never hear me well enough to understand what i was saying.  turns out, it was our lousy internet, because once we changed our service and got a new gateway, suddenly alexa can hear every word i say to her, from every room in the house.i use her (sheesh, ""her"") primarily for weather forecasts, reminders, timers, music, and to mess with my work-from-home roommate by setting random reminders for her to start talking to him out of the blue in the middle of the day."
545,14,"so far the echol has performed well the tasks it advertises, however, i can not find answers to questions about performing synchronized tasks with the dot. it will play music in sync but i would like to know if it is supposed to read from my audible books as well - can not get that to happen. my biggest disappointment is not being able to contact any kind of support for my specific question, and i did not see anything related in the support section."
546,11,got this and the new echo plus. the sound quality on the plus is so much better. i think the problem is that the fabric cover muffles the sound. not a sound improvement.
547,9,"i purchased an echo dot first because i was not really sure how much i would use it. i got it and instantly fell in love. it is amazing. i found myself listening to music all time. i found myself turning off the tv to listen. so when my husband asked if i wanted an echo for christmas i said absolutely. i sound quality is amazing. seriously. i love it. $3.99 a month and i can listen to pretty much any song i want, anytime i want.music is not the only thing echo does. it really is an amazing product and i would recommend it to anyone."
548,14,"love my echo first edition and love my amazon tap that sounds almost as good and is rechargeable so i can take with.this second edition did not work out for me. sound was not as good as first and crackled at higher volumes even shut off my router twice? looks nice, like the charcoal colored fabric but returned. amazon was great and refunded my money same day they received it back.i purchased the echo plus and i¡¯m going to try it out this weekend."
549,14,"i have been using the echo dot in my house for a while so decided to add one more echo to the household. so far i love my new echo. the sound quality is very good. i did not play music on the dot very often, but have a feeling that will be different with this new echo. i love how easy all of the echos make playing audible books. the ease of setting reminders, timers, and alarms is wonderful. if i remember something important as i am about to fall asleep rather than turning on the light and searching for pen and paper, or grabbing my phone to set a reminder, i can tell alexa to remind me in the morning without needing to even open my eyes!"
550,14,"i own an echo show, echo {1st generation), echo dot (1st generation).  with this purchase, during black friday deals, i now have an echo (2nd generation) and an echo dot (2nd generation).  i purchased each one of these items so i can have music or talk radio playing through out the house.  i really like the fabric choices of this 2nd generation echo.  i also like that it is smaller than the 1st generation echo.  i do not notice a sound difference in the speakers.  i think both speakers are very good.  a year ago i did not have echo in the house and figured i did not need alexa.  well, i am now a convert.  i consider having alexa here a real asset.  i can find out what the temperature and weather is outside at my whim.  she will set timers to help keep me on schedule.  i can ask her to set an alarm for 6:20 am and she complies.  i can tell her to play for an hour and a half and she turns off as directed.  because alexa is constantly improving, i imagine there are things in the future she will assist me with that i have not even imagined today.  if you are the type of person who just wants to take a product out of the box and with very little effort on your part have it do everything you have read about, you will be disappointed in alexa.  if however, you like searching for and trying new apps, then you are going to be extremely pleased with alexa.  my recommendation (born from experience) would be to purchase this 2nd generation echo.  the echo dot has its purpose, but this item is the better item.  the echo dot makes a nice gift or using it in a room where you do not want to take up much space."
551,14,a disappointment in the echo line compared to our 1st generation echo. half the time it does not understand us or just plays some off the wall song instead of what you asked her to play. will randomly just start and say she does not understand that. the cover is nice on it though even if it does not work half the time.update: i was contacted by dale at amazon and we got the problem figured out. dale was very helpful and someone that seems to enjoy their job and takes the time to figure out any issues. i have updated my review to 5 stars. thank you dale!also like to commend amazon on how quick they were to respond to me about this.
552,11,bad sound quality. misleading advertising about the quality of sound. misleading advertising about a special price offer by buying early before product release.  surprised and disappointed by amazon.
553,14,"i really like the echo.  i have two of them and primarily use them for streaming music and radio programs.  also great when you need a time or weather update.  also makes a great waking alarm.  it is so easy to use and set up.  i love being able to just find out information by asking a question or play music or radio with a simple voice command.  also enjoy being able to listen to audio books, news, bible readings and so much more.  these are all things i used to use my computer or smart phone to do, but then i would have to fumble with those devices, log in, find the desired app, etc.  now i do not have to think about any of that stuff.  i just ask alexa and she does the footwork."
554,14,"i love alexa, but i find myself getting frustrated by all the things that i think she should do that she can not. she needs a great search engine, so you can get more answers and more recommendations. it can be frustrating how you have to phrase things just the right way to get the answers that you want. there are not as many apps/ skills as i¡¯d like and the ones that are there just start to scratch the surface. i own two echo devices and will likely buy more, but they do not work together as harmoniously as i¡¯d like. sometimes the one in the other room answers instead of the one in the room i¡¯m in. the one in the other room has randomly been streaming music on its own. i love having alexa, i just want her to grow more rapidly. top of my wish list are integrated search engine, ability to access the library overdrive app, better recipe access, more seamless transition between rooms, better map integration/access. also, we bought the echo buttons, but there is hardly anything you can do with them yet."
555,14,"the highs on echo, what can i say, the design of the outside to match my decor, the sound, the sound of the women is voice, the skills and it can become great companion when your by your self or you need assistance when i am cooking.my lows, i would like to here her speak spanish and english with out having to pick either or, more human like interactive abilities, little more power on the amp side, as far as sound quality.overall i love this device, keep up the great work, looking forward to seeing your advancements on this device.thank you"
556,14,"amazon promotes 'group play' but has released a software with huge holes in it.  the support people respond quickly but the answers are weak and offer no substantive resolve.  when on group play individual units (either echo first gen or second gen or dots) do not respond properly to questions or instructions. failing approximately 50% of the time to even understand.  repeated instructions to 'shut off' 'stop playing' 'off' go ignored and instructions to change volume to specific levels also go ignored.  the units appear to hear the instructions (the blue light ring), but then after a second or two go back to doing whatever they were doing.  sometimes lowering the volume for a second or two then raising it again.  and if a specific volume number is given it will be ignored as verified by the alexa app.it seems that the only way to control these units in a group is to use the alexa app as voice commands seem to be ignored half of the timei personally do not want to send the units back as they (as hardware) are okay but the software is substandard especially for amazon.in addition a dot will not pair with an ecoxgear cube (old style or new style)so in conclusion: a great idea poorly executed with no apparent resolve in the planning stages... surprising for amazon.if i had known i would not have purchased another echo unit and four dots until they had worked out the bugs (something that should have been done prior to release)"
557,14,"i just received this echo 2nd generation as a gift a couple of days ago. i could not be more impressed. i was not sure if the sound quality would come close to my new bose color link speaker, i just purchased a few months ago, but let me tell you, it is as good if not better. aside from the thousands of things the echo is capable of doing instantly by voice command, the music is no different. just say...alexa, play ""whatever you choose"", by song title, genre, artist etc., and it instantaneously. everything can be controlled by your voice, volume up or down, pause song, play from beginning, play from where you left off etc. i can not say enough great things about this echo. i was immediately impressed. there are so many things this can do to list them all on here. my best friend and also my sister will be purchasing one soon. that is how good it is. it does fill the room with quality sound. a great bass and midrange sound. i love it, and most probably, you will too."
558,14,"i like it. alexa is amazing and has so much potential. they have made so many improvements in such few months. the only thing i do not like is how you can only do certain things with certain music services. but if you want to do everything, you need a separate subscription to amazon music unlimited. there is no need to get the products that have a viewing screen, this product without the screen is better.it sounds great for a 100 dollar speaker."
559,14,"i can not believe i waited so long to get on board (maybe 2nd gen and deep amazon discounts did the trick).this device is just simply amazing. using the word ""simply"" is intended as it is such a breeze to set up.i love my new friend and have sent 3 out as the perfect christmas gift !- cannot say enough good things about this device (i know it sounds like a paid advertisement but it is not, especially at $79)!just do it :-)"
560,9,my first echo i have purchased and so far i am enjoying it the speaker sounds nice and so far is working great with the smart home items i have purchased.
561,14,"i received this as a gift,  and i could not be happier.  i love the option to change my music preference, search weather, traffic etc.  you can even play games on the echo.  i wish i could rename my echo to whate very i wanted, but there are only a few ""wake"" options.  that is ok.  the sound is amazing.  it would be nice it is was cordless, but it still works amazing.  i am very happy, and can not wait to unlock more of its features."
562,11,"i was expecting (hoping?) the audio quality would be a bit better, but it really does not sound bad. i purchased 4 of the new echos to replace 4 dots, and they do make a huge difference in the quality and volume of multi-room audio. i appreciate the new designs but also miss the flexibility of the sleeves, much easier (and cheaper) to change the sleeves to match decor than moving echos around or buying one with a different design. overall a good purchase, i may even buy a couple more."
563,14,"i got my echo device as a free gift with the purchase of a moto x 4 on amazon. before i got the echo i was using a google home mini. so far i love my echo the audio quality is much better than my mini, as i expected and alexa is actually not bad as a personal assistant. as far as which is better google or amazon i would honestly say that depends what you want out of your smart speaker. for me i mostly use mine for music and answering a few questions for me. so in my opinion they are about equal, i also like that you can get amazon music on your echo for only 3.99 a month. i would say if you are curious about the device pick one up they are great."
564,14,"i have 4 echo is and two fire tv boxes.  love them.  i bought this because they said the sound was better, and it was improved.  the sound was not as good as the old model.  no dial on top to turn.  i was so disappointed.  i put the two units side by side, old and new.  i asked friends and family their opinion.  the old model (taller echo) won each time.  everyone said the dial on top was much easier to use, and the sound was richer.  i appreciate amazon giving me my money back, and taking back the unit."
565,14,"while the echo has plenty of cool features, buyer beware that there are a few big services that this device does not provide. these are very disappointing and i may return mind if i cannot find a good solution.the first one is that if you have several echos in one household and would like to link them together to stream music all over the house as advertised they must all be on the same amazon account! so if you have roomates you either cannot link them or if you do then all items purchased on the echo will come from one persons account thus credit card. not well thought out in my opinion.the second one is an even bigger disappointment. amazon will not play nice with your apple or android accounts so the only way to stream music is either one of the approved music services like amazon or pandora or connect to the echo as a bluetooth speaker. if you have your entire library on apple or android like i do, you are out of luck."
566,14,"great sound! it is nearly as good as our sony stereo. this surprises me since subwoofers are generally quite large. this relatively small device still manages a full-bodied sound. this is our new go to device for listening to music at home. i started out with the echo dot and found out how easy it is to listen to music without commercials then upgraded to this echo device which is so much superior with sound quality over the dot. we still use the dot...moved it to the garage! with wifi and a prime subscription, you can listen to a whole world of music. i am hoping one day amazon will include inputs so you can use it as surround sound for the tv too."
567,14,"this thing sounds amazing, and fills up our entire family room with good quality sound. it looks great on our counter. voice recognition, especially when it comes to music needs drastic improvements. most of the artists i ask it to play can not be found through my spotify premium service. however, this is a phenomenal deal when you consider it costs less than some bluetooth speakers, but comes with a fully functional, always on digital assistant. hoping that amazon continues to invest in this technology."
568,11,the audio is worse than the 1st generation echo. the microphones are better. looks great.
569,14,"why is it so annoying? but it is. even when you say things clearly, like ¡°play abc news radio¡± or ¡°play abc news radio on tune in¡± even though it was working perfectly the week before, she will deliver some other station randomly over and over.it is not a smart speaker if you want to replace the radio, and simple solutions line shoehorning the b**** to do an ¡°if this then that¡± solution is obviously too hard - well because; it can not.i got these predom for my 78 year old mother to make her life easier and so far it is been a consistent misery. to her credit, she knows not to give up her old tinny radio and i look a fool trying to make her switch"
570,14,"i give 4 stars because the app ""alexa amazon"" cannot be downloaded in mexico city where i live and had to ask my daughter who lives in miami beach, florida, to let me use her iphone to download the app to configure the echo and be able to use it here. the echo remains configured and can use it for most voice commands, including the temperature in centigrade degrees and the distance in kilometers as well as the date and time in mexico. it is a very good device, useful but i ask the people of amazon to release the ""alexa amazon"" application for mexico. i am a frequent amazon purchaser and would like to have this echo and another echo dot i have working flawlesly and do any change anytime i need or i want. the spanish language should also be considered to be used. i hope you guys of amazon correspond to these requests. best regards."
571,14,"alexa is an interesting electronic item.  she tries to accommodate my every command.  she also responds to tv ads that mention her name at which time, she politely explains she cannot find that information.  she plays most music you ask for, having difficulty with classical composers.  example: asking for a specific performance of mozart piano concerto may not be possible. so far, she has found the composition but not the specific performer.  she turns herself off after a specific piece is done.  but if ask for an era of music, she will continue to play until you tell her to stop. i have not explored most of her features, but i will in time."
572,14,"i am tired of it having false responses to soundit goes if in the middle of the television being on.i wish there was something written stating that amazon is not keeping the things these devices hear.makes us nervous but we use it anyway.sound quality during ""dropping in"" is not good. sounds very tinny.audio for playing music is good.they need to come up with better circuitry for it to be used as a speakerphone for both ends of the conversation.also it needs bluetooth connected microphones so mic picks up where the voice in the room is the loudest/located."
573,14,"i never owned 1st gen echo but have several echo dots along with other alexa devices for example, 2 kindle fires and 4 firetv sticks. i find the 2nd gen echo amazing. i have heard the sound quality of the 1st gen echo and believe me this one is right up there with it. some complain about the sound quality or the fact that it cannot understand what they are saying. well it all depends we¡¯re you place it in the room. if you have it against a wall it will sound distorted and sometimes it will no understand or not respond because the sound is bouncing off the wall. open space is what is needed for optimal functionality of any echo device."
574,14,"i was given this little gadget as a gift.  and so far, i am really liking what it can do.  it can provide music, news, weather, trivia, games, and much more.  i have paired it with my home stereo system, so any music, sounds (thunderstorm, ocean, etc.) that i can play i can hear in full surround sound. i am learning more and more each day and the emails from amazon which give me tips and tricks, etc. has been very educational.  i have also paired it with various devices at my home, which i can now vocally control.  (raise the heat, turn off a light, etc.)  hopefully more and more conveniences will arise as they continue to develop the product."
575,14,"received as a gift. works fine. sound is good and when connected with the iphone it will act as a music speaker. this can cause surprise when using the phone in another room. i can make calls using it as well.  i do not think it can answer calls to the cell phone.  still looking for a must-have application for using beyond weather, temperature and flash briefings. oh, and also using the timer to make tea. had a little trouble the first time getting it to connect to my iphone. it wakes up when it hears an alexa commercial on tv - luckily  there are no family members named alexa. so now there is a ton of recorded conversations with no content. google sent me a notice saying i should check my security because they did not think the echo was as secure as they could wish for.  amazon needs to stress security and privacy concerns about using the echo. the ""sky is falling"" geeks publish articles that these devices are ""always on & listening"" and it might be possible to abuse them. they do not mention that the echo needs to be activated to actually record and transmit information to their masters. this has freaked out my wife and friends."
576,14,"i am an echo fan. i have 2-echos and 4-dots. i would rate all the others 5-stars, but not this one. this one is very tempromental and is inefficient. if you are more than 2-feet away you have to holler and hope it understands. my others you can talk to literally from the other room. i do not know if i just have a bad unit or what it is one of the most expensive models supposedly with all the upgrades in speaker quality. it is one of the short squaty models that comes in colors. it looks nice, but the quality sucks. it now resides within 12 to 18 inches from my voice and even then i sometimes i have to try the second time fo wake it up. and yes, i have done the learn your voice setup@ things multiple times, but still no better"
577,14,"finally, they paid attention the speaker setup in the echo dot ii. i wish i could give my others back, including the echo show. the sound on all my echo is plus my first alexa was horrible. the mid-range was flat, there were no high is, if it spoke to long sentences my brain was not able to decipher what it was saying quick enough.i will give away my old one is to family :) and replace them with these.i am so thrilled."
578,11,"sounds just as good as the old bigger model and half the price. sounds much better than the google home and cheaper. our primary use is as a wifi radio. now that ""computer"" is a new wake word they so need to find a majel barrett sound-alike to do the voice. i would pay extra."
579,14,"music sounds better compared to the 1st generation echo. i think the speaker is optimized to clearly play the human voice. the bass is a bit too boomy while the treble is weak and lacks punch. of course this is subjective, but i am used to sonos speakers which are in a different league altogether.that said, the music streaming from spotify and sirius xm is not reliable. the music just cuts off. when this happens and i ask ""what is playing"", it thinks the music is still streaming."
580,14,"works wonderfully out of the packaging. i bought this as a christmas present for my significant other and while i accidentally ruined the surprise, i went ahead and gave it to him as an early present.he is absolutely in love with it because he can use it to start his truck, check how he is doing in fantasy football, of course choose any song on pandora, but his biggest glee was that his phone can be locked and it still accesses it.we are already planning on buying one more and maybe a dot for our bedroom."
581,14,"we have a rule in our house, none of the kids can take their phones into their rooms. which turns into an issue since the kids love listening to music while cleaning their rooms or during showers.so santa got my kids the echo dot during christmas. talk about a crowd pleaser, as soon as they walk in, the kids unmute their dots and start asking alexa questions and to play their playlist.we got the amazon echo for one of our sons for his birthday. he loves playing music, playing trivia with alexa and using his echo as an alarm clock. we will more than likely getting echo is for our other kids for their birthdays. we are an apple family but alexa and amazon are slowly but surely finding their place in our household.parents if you have a younger kid who is shy or does not talk as loud, i recommend getting an amazon echo or echo dot. we have a 5 year old who is shy, who lets her brothers talk for her. since getting an echo dot even her teacher has talked to us how she is talking louder, clearer and with more confidence. we give all the credit to her dot, it is making her pronounce her words betters and making her talk clearer."
582,14,alexa did not understand my dad and he did not understand her either.  i really really wanted echo alexa to work with my senior parent but she did not understand what he said nearly 100% of the time.  it just frustrated him.read how its used in some senior living homes and can provide medication reminders and answer questions ( that get asked repeatedly....without getting annoyed)i really wish for the snl silver alexa-  its so relatable!!!!
583,10,"sound quality is good for it is size - good enough that i bought a second. however, that just leads to more than double the aggravation as alexa almost never gets my request correct - especially when asking for music to play through both. here is the jist...alexa, play lumineers on home group= i can not find any music by the lumineersalexa, play lumineers on home group= i can not find any music by the lumineersalexa. play lumineers!!!= shuffling songs by the lumineersalexa, play on home group (for both speakers)= starts playing kids lullaby music for who knows what reasonugh!!! just forget it."
584,14,"this is my first echo and i bought it mostly for fun and because it was a good price. now i am liking it very much.  alexa is fun but she is also proving useful.  i have since set an echo up for my aging parents to get them use to it.  of course they poo-poo the idea of needing alexa right now, and they are right but they are not getting any younger.  by the time that being able to voice control their lights and phone becomes safety features for them, i want them to have accepted and become familiar with alexa.  right now, setting timers and checking the news/weather is mostly what my parents do with alexa but that is a good start."
585,14,"i got this for my boyfriend for christmas and he loves it. some reviews say that it has a delay in responding, but i¡¯m certain it has to do with their wifi connection. it is very responsive and has great sound! he loves coming home from work and asking alexa to play his favorite music. i also got the dot to connect to his bluetooth speakers and he loves it too! you can tell the echo to play music from the dot instead which i think is very cool!"
586,14,"i am a long time owner of both the echo gen 1 & the echo dot gen 2, and have been very happy with both. i pre-ordered the echo gen 2 and was excited to receive it. when i hooked it up and played some music thru it, and then told alexa to stop, the music continued to play for a short burst. i do not have that problem with my gen 1. i contacted amazon and they sent me a new one without a hassle. when i hooked the replacement up, the same issue was there. on nov 3rd i contacted the amazon echo department, and they advised me that there was a known issue with the music on the gen 2, and it would be fixed by nov 6th. well, today is nov 8th and nothing is changed, so regrettably i am returning my second gen 2. i might add, after reading other reviews, i agree that the quality of the sound from the gen 2 is, at best, worse than my gen 1. voices are muffled and music is not crisp. amazon is claim of improved sound was my major reason for purchasing this 2nd generation device. it was indeed a disappointment."
587,14,"i doubt there is anything i can say that others have not, but this thing is awesome. we continue to find ways to utilize it, although it can be tricky to remember how to launch the correct skills or use the right commands but that may improve over time. the microphones can pick up from other side of room and around corners. it is amazing how when the music is loud it can still hear my commands. the music quality is good but not great. i am an audio freak that usually uses bose speakers for music. for this size it is good but i would like a little more bass in my tunes if possible. but overall i still love this and hope to get more."
588,10,"i am enjoying my echo, although i probably do not use it as much as i could. i sometimes forget what it can do, but it is a pleasure to use. one of my favorite things has been having it read to me from books in my kindle library. i also bought a dot for another room. there is a bit of a learning curve to getting used to using it and learning all it can do, but well worth the time and effort to do so. i look forward to expanding the uses i make of it."
589,14,"it is fairly easy to set up, just takes a few minutes, and she is ready to go! the sound is pretty great, so i occasionally open spotify to play music while i¡¯m cleaning the house. what is even better, is that i can have the echo and echo dot, play the same music at the same time. just set it up and then you can say ¡°alexa, play music everywhere.¡±i also have phillips hue bulbs and tp-link smart plugs, and were some of the first skills that i added. it is pretty great to tell alexa to turn on or off my lights, as i¡¯m coming home or heading out the door. super helpful if you have a lot in your hands and can not reach for the light switch. so far, i¡¯m really enjoying the echo. it is the product i¡¯ve dreamed of as a kid, and now it is here!i¡¯m excited to see more technology that¡¯ll be compatible  with alexa, as it continues to develop. who knows, maybe i¡¯ll have a smart kitchen soon."
590,14,"bought this as a gift for my mom. they are very pleased and happy.they are still learning how to voice commands properly, but they will get there...the quality of the speakers are reasonably clear and loud. however, we hooked up a 5.1 sound system to the echo so playing music is crisp, clear and as loud as they want it to be. (the downfall with that, is alexa is voice would be channeling through those speakers as well...)"
591,10,"husband received this as a company christmas present. was not sure if we wanted to keep it but i did want a speaker for my music. after learning more about the echo, i became excited. one of my favorite things is my grocery list and to do list. i just tell alexa the things i need and she adds it to the list. this is just one of the ¡°skills¡± i have had alexa learn. there are many more i need to discover."
592,14,"update: found problem and now everything is working.  updated stars to 5.  (we have two accounts and one was not configured correctly.)i would give it a 5 star rating but for some reason the gen 2 will not turn on and off my leviton smart switches.  the gen 1 echo, echo dot and fire tv work fine turning on, off and dimming.  for some reason the gen 2 is not recognizing the leviton devices.i am happy with the synchronizing of music across the echos  (after i discovered it uses bluetooth for syncing which was affecting my echo dot music output) just wish the fire tv could also be grouped"
593,14,i have to reconnect to wifi inside of the app almost everyday which takes upwards of 5-10 minutes. which completely takes away from the functionality and purpose of a hands free machine. also does not connect well with my old amazon echo and has started to make it appear offline as well. before hand there were no problems with my first generation echo. very disappointed in this - looking to return or wait for a software patch.
594,14,"i like this gizmo. radio reception is terrible where i live, and the stations are worse. i have an old bose wave for serious listening. i stuck this thing on the kitchen counter where i can use it when making coffee in the morning. sometimes i have to argue with alexa a little but that is okay. sounds surprisingly good for such a small unit. you are not going to dj a keg party with it, but for use in an apartment kitchen it is just fine."
595,10,"we are loving this new toy, i speak to it every morning. with prime music, the song library is endless and the sound quality is superb for it is compact size. alexa helps me with my spelling, gives me the weather everyday and answers most of my questions."
596,14,at 5 months my daughter started listening to music. we used to cast on our tv initially but when she started staring at the hd screen we decided we need to find a solution. now we got three of these for one in each room. any room she is in she has music. we play multi room music as well. we also use it to play white noise when we put her to sleep. it is very difficult to search and fumble with a remote when having a baby. the voice commanding is so easy. the microphone is sensitive enough that i can talk to alexa without waking up the baby sleeping in my arms. definitely a recommendation for parents with babies.
597,14,"i love my echo but there are some things that i wish it could do that either i have not figured out or it is not programmed to do yet. love the fact that i can get reminders, alerts, timers etc set without having to reach for my phone. i would love to dictate a text or possibly respond to a whatsapp message when i am cooking. i have not set it up with any family members devices but would love to know if i can drop in on another family member is device. if so, could help with staying in contact with my mom or sending her reminders to take her medication. love the music. i would like it if i could program things for alexa to say or have more conversation with her. i would like it if she responded to ""thank you alexa."" there is so much that could be done with this and i look forward to seeing what is ahead."
598,14,"as others have mentioned, sound quality is a major fail with the new echo, and is falsely advertised as ""improved quality"".  i had high hopes for this one.  currently own a gen1 echo and was super excited when gen2 came out.  i use the device mostly to listen to music on the go.  to me, that is one of the most valuable features. while the bass is a little deeper/richer, the rest of the sound (maybe treble?) just comes across as fragmented and noisy, without any kind of balance.  i test played a bunch of different songs and all of them made me cringe on the inside (yes i am a picky music lover).  sorry amazon, this one is going back."
599,14,"what a huge downgrade from the 1st generation. i can not believe amazon ruined something so amazing. it fails to respond constantly. the blue ring will just stay lit without a response. the sound is powerful, but not very good quality, especially on higher volumes. if you have multiple echo is, for some reason a more distant one in another room will often respond instead of the 2nd gen echo just feet away. i got so sick of unplugging the 2nd gen to reboot that i stuck it in a room i barely use and use my old 1st generation echo as the primary. i sometimes get a crackling sound when hooked to devices by bluetooth. my connection to sirius will drop for no reason. i will sometimes open the alexa app and find only the 2nd gen showing as offline.no wonder they priced it much lower than the 1st gen echo. it is clearly an inferior, unfinished device that was rushed out to maximize holiday sales. do yourself a favor and buy a refurbished 1st gen echo once they are back on sale."
600,14,"very disappointed with this one. i was given an echo as a gift and at first it seemed to work pretty well so i ordered the 2nd generation and a dot. not sure what when wrong but now alex is favorite response is ""sorry something went wrong"". even with simple commands like ""play pandora radio"". it will not play existing custom stations anymore. one by one they get the same response ""sorry something went wrong"". the 2nd version has a difficult time staying connected to my wifi. the first generation model in the same spot never had this issue. so many more issues but i do not have time to write about them."
601,14,"i have  2nd generations dots a first generation echo and now the 2nd generation echo and i love them all i love being able to play music for my favorite artists, the alarm feature and i finding out what the weather is at a moments notice. i also love to watch it learn and when you ask it a question you never know what it will say. i have one of my dots in my shop and i can just be working away listening to music with out any interruptions or advertising i love it!! i have the 2nd generation in the living room and it might pickup your voice a little bit better that the other one but they are both great."
602,14,"this is my third echo. i have the first, a dot and now this. i placed them throughout the house and i truly appreciate the technology that goes into making echo such a unique item. i love the availability of music and information. however, with the 2nd generation echo i notice a hiss sound that i do not hear in my original or with the dot. not sure if it is the ""improved"" sound of the dolby enhanced 2nd generation echo or what. it is annoying however. i will give it time to see if i adjust to it or it adjusts to me! otherwise, amazing and enjoyable product."
603,14,"we got our echo 2nd gen delivered yesterday.  it is going to be a gift for the whole family.  i set it up this morning after everyone left for school.  the set up was very easy, (i have mediocre technology skills).  i have been playing all sorts of music - relaxing classical to ozzy osbourne.  it all sounds great.  i was very pleased to see the size of it, slightly larger than a can of soda, taller and wider.  i quickly saw the reason why a dot would be a great addition to the christmas package for the family."
604,14,"the 2nd generation echo is not at all as good as the first. i will call ""alexa"" and the light turns on and goes off immediately after, giving me no time to say anything. when she does stay on long enough for me to say something such as ""stop the music"", she ignores me or will totally misinterpret my words. i am very disappointed with the new echo, i wish they fixed the bugs before selling these."
605,14,i do enjoy using alexa. one of m favorite features is you can make calls from it. we had debated getting an additional cell phone juat to leave at home on those rare occasions when my kids needed to call me. this has done the trick! if i have to run a quick errand i know my older kids can still reach me! that being said its not quite as user friendly as i would like. some of its features it seems you have to ask the question in just the right way to work (this seems more so with prime music). however i am very happy with the product! we use it as a sort of intercom to call our kids in the basement.
606,14,"great for all needs, need to set a wake up alarm, alexa got you, music party in the room? why would not you, you got the brand new echo 2nd gen, you can have them relay messages between family members who have them, great for voice com and great for doing all other sorts of useful things, i would at least purchase two if not three. note, it has a hard time understanding this sometimes and you will need to unplug and plug it back in again every week or so id say"
607,14,"i received this as a christmas present and so far i¡¯m loving it, this is something you¡¯ll want in every room after you get one. read the reviews and people are saying that the sound quality is not better than the first one but comparing the 2nd gen to the 1st gen with my friend we agreed the 2nd gen has way better speaker quality. also this thing can like hear you like scary way to good. i live in an apartment and my neighbors know i have an echo because they¡¯ve walked by a few times saying alexa and she picks up. kind of annoying but this is still really nice! i also received the smart plug in the echo so i have my lamp plugged into it so now all i have to say is ¡®alexa turn on the lamp¡¯ instead of turning on the switch <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+008a>"
608,14,"if i can set up a device anyone can. my teenagers were impressed to come home from school and find me listening to music on our new echo - without having to ask them to set it up for me. really, i am completely technologically challenged but this was a super easy set up."
609,14,"bought this as a gift for my mom.  looks cool and has a few cool features, but this thing drove me nuts over christmas.  it is like having an old aunt that is hard of hearing, calling out your name 644 times until she gets your attention....alexa!! alexa!! alexa!!! alexa!!!  i think you need to be a senior citizen to really appreciate this device.  alexa!! tell me a joke.  alexa!! what is the weather?  seriously?? is this the future??  i will buy one for myself when alexa can pour me a drink to deal with the constant blast of who can say alexa..do ""this"" faster than the other 10 people in the room.  also, this is not wireless.  yes, it uses a wifi connection, but it need to be plugged in constantly to work (not that i mind unplugging it!!!) :/"
610,9,"love my alexa, i definitely do not get the full use of it because i live in an apartment and cannot make my whole home smart, but the music and the smart plugs alone make it worth it. the speaker has a nice bass and sound to it and alexa is super responsive and quick. brought 2 more for the other rooms in my house."
611,14,"i just got this today and i love the sound it puts out with music. i live in a small condo and this is just what i was looking for. i have not tried a lot of the features yet, and i¡¯m having trouble setting up my calendar, but i¡¯m sure i¡¯ll get it figured out. i do not usually write reviews, but this thing is amazing!"
612,14,"i have the first generation and it beats this one by a mile, which is crazy. i have had nothing but trouble with this one. sometimes you have to yell to get it to pick up your voice even though you are 2 feet from it. it frequently will not perform skills and when you ask to open a certain skill it will instead ask you if you want to make a call. i have contacted support 3 times and they all say to reset it or unplug it. i can not keep resetting it and unplugging it every single time i want to use it."
613,14,"i got this for my husband as a ""not too expensive"" toy.  i was the one who programmed it and set up.  i absolutely love it!  we both like being able to ask for music. got her to recognize our voices.  i am learning new applications every day to make this ""toy"" an integral tool in my house.  measure exchanges, shopping lists, ""who was author of the tale of two cities?""  all the stuff i would have to stop and google mid conversation.  the speaker is fabulous.  i also got the dot, and that speaker is much less quality.  but dot is also not promoted to be of same sound quality.  i got my hue smart plugs and i tell alexa to turn of plugged in lights.  tv hubs more complicated.  not rocket-science, but it did take some time to ""get connected"" with other devices.  for me works best with my i-phone (my lists show up on my phone, too, through the amazon echo alexa app., and/or via any.do free app.  not sure who is in charge?  manageable with my samsung android tablet.  less from my windows 10 pc.big brother may be listening?  frankly, i do not care.  i think amazon is doing the right thing to absorb consumer use and creativity to enhance the product with their own gurus, versus making it obsolete and you just have to buy the next generation, like apple is famous for.great product and can not wait for more user interface enhancements.  i will probably buy another dot for guest bedroom and another echo for the back deck. just be patient and focused when you set about making it work with your other devices.  it will. subscribe to and read the cnet consumer input.  ultimately, this ""toy"" is morphing into a very useful, intelligent, reliable device in my home.  oh, and thru an app you can send your list to the printer!  i hope they improve the voice recognition so that it becomes more ""intelligent"" with human interaction and picks up on preferred words, etc.  or maybe it does...and i have not figured out yet?!"
614,14,"i like the volume levels it gives, you can really hear it through out the house. i like the sleep mode. i dont like that my kids can not use alexa, she can not understand them. i have tried to set them up and get her used to their voices but it never works. there are times were i ask for a song and she says it does not exist yet she plays it when listening to a sound track. i will ask what song it is and she will tell me the same name and artist i previously asked for. you can not tell her you like a song or to remind her you like it.if you like listening to music only this is awesome. i would repurchase again just for amazon music."
615,14,"i expected the hyped microphone array to be better than it actually is. when hearing music through the echo, or even worse - through a tv, you have to practically shout multiple times to get its attention. pretty impractical to use as a smart remote for pausing or controlling volume on the tv or hearing loud music on it.other than that, i am pretty pleased. the one caveat being the customer service which was somehow the worst i have ever gotten from amazon, not to mention its amazon is own product...luckily i got everything fixed in the end, and am enjoying it.on the app front, it leaves plenty to be desired-* no ability to create alarm clocks manually, only edit existing omes* no ability to create recurring reminders* app seems to completely rely on an internet connection, so even while on the same wifi as the echo, every click takes a while to load.* list management is ok, but no google keep integration. (annoying because if you switch to using that as your main list app, the loading times mentioned above are highly noticeable, and unavoidable since you can not check or remove items by voice)"
616,14,"i exchanged the echo plus for this because it was less expensive and i did not need the hub feature on the plus.  after set up; everything works as expected.  i also found that the sound on this echo was a bit better than the echo plus.  however, it could be just personal taste. when comparing, the second generation echo was less ""tinny"" with higher pitched music.  very excited and want to order another for christmas!"
617,11,"just got this in. it looks great, but that is about it...all they hype on it having better sounds and bass. well that is not the case. i bought this in exchange for an echo dot, and it seriously sounds about the same. my 1st gen sounds so much better. i do not expect these little things to sound like a concert, but i figured this 2nd gen would sound the same, or even a little better than the 1st gen. nope!  pretty disappointed. i may return it."
618,14,"our first experience with one of these devices.  met my expectation that <u+2013> at this point <u+2013> these units from various vendors (amazon, google, soon apple) are solutions looking for a problem.  there is a novelty to talking to it and telling it to play some music but, having done that, it is simply an expensive monophonic radio.  otherwise, the primary usefulness appears to be: 1) listening to the news, 2) checking on the weather, and 3) setting a timer for food we are preparing (ours is in the kitchen) <u+2013> all things that can be done with a smartphone.  i can see potential uses for overall control of the so-called ""smart home,"" but we are nowhere close to that and probably will not be for the near-term future.  my wife purchased it as a christmas family gift <u+2013> i suggested she return it for credit, but have left that decision to her..."
619,14,"do not like the second generations volume control buttons for when you need to ""fine tune"" the volume. the first generation had a volume control ring which was easy to use, especially in the night or if you did not have your glasses on. second generation has four control ""divits"" on the top and you have to have your glasses on or a light on to figure out which one to press. do like that you can pick out the ""color"" sleeve you want.i do love the fact that i can control the night stand light with this echo with the purchase of the plug. i will be buying more plugs to use with my two echos."
620,10,"i can not say enough great things about my echo. firstly, alexa is a super fun to have. her knowledge about everything helps in a pinch. but she mostly just plays the wheels on the bus to appease my toddler. second, the speakers are phenomenal. it is amazing that this little cylinder is able to produce such amazing sound. thirdly, the color scheme is perfect and blends into its surroundings. i highly recommend this product."
621,14,"working perfectly! i was sick of listening to music on a dot. i originally bought dots for multiple rooms not thinking i would really use them enough to spend 100 on a full size echo. i bought this echo to replace my most used dot, the kitchen.  what a difference it makes. the sound is more complete and louder. much easier to enjoy music from, and everything else as well.it is not a high end speaker system but sounds great for the layman!the old kitchen dot is headed to my garage to hook up to a bluetooth receiver and my garage system.  alexa just makes things easier."
622,11,"ordered this only because i was expecting dramatically improved sound quality, as i use it mostly for music. huge disappointment. sounds almost identical to my first generation echo, maybe even worse. and yes it is updated to the latest firmware. do not waste your money on this if you already have the original echo."
623,14,"the echo loses connection all the time, which i am sure will be blamed on my internet no matter where i put it in a room where my wireless router is located. i have cable internet and it is fast. the setup and help section is poorly addressed and needs to be fixed. the tech was given to me as a gift if i had the choice i would have passed, i still use my computer and iphone to access amazon for my needs while echo sits there."
624,14,i love alexa.... this new model does have better sound but it is not close to replacing my stereo or even my even my harmon kardon onyx bluetooth speakers.  but it is perfect when my 3 year old wants to hear something (yes he can tell alexa what he wants all by himself <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+009c>) or when several of us are together and it is just kind of spontaneous where wants us to hear something and then someone else dose.  it is perfect for those occasions.  also you can listen to podcasts this way or even get a quick roundup of the news..  oh yea and she will even say goodnight! and turn your light off!!
625,14,"i was skeptical that i would find this useful, but within an hour of trying it i was convinced it is a great addition to our house.the device is powerful, and i doubt i will ever use more than 10% of its potential. for questions, it is so much easier than typing on a computer broweser. alexa is also much more accurate than siri.  the huge number of skills associated with echo make it an incredibly powerful tool to turn on lights, media, shopping, home security, hvac, etc.we liked this so much we bought the echo spot to replace our bedroom alarm clock as an infinitely more versatile and powerful unit - and one that is small and attractive."
626,10,i honesty was not sure if my husband would enjoy this since he is sometimes difficult to buy a gift for but he absolutely loves it!  he uses it daily to listen to music (anything you can imagine from country to classical and all you have to do is ask) and turn off his bedside light.  he is also one of those people who is always googling things so he uses it for that too.  we do enjoy having this in our home.  i would recommend this as a gift for anyone-from elderly or disabled persons who use the voice activation to do just about anything for them to the kids who like to listen to bedtime stories.
627,14,"if one must be a freak and own three of these in a one bedroom apartment, this one is starting to be a fave. my echo dot is hooked to an amp and plays big klipsh speakers. sometimes, you do not need all that action, this echo fills the bill. a little too blankety blank chatty sometimes. oh, my original echo, that chick is the best $200 timer i ever bought. i need all three, i live in america."
628,14,these have a number of good uses and some not to good ones. but over all i am very happy with it. i have transferred some of my home to smart home and alexa dues a good job operating it for me. i love when i wake up in the morning to be able to ask alexa the weather outside and current news while i lay  there. i purchased 2 alexa and two dots. can play music throughout my house using the everywhere skill. i keep one in my computer room. when i am writing or texting an have trouble spelling a word all i have to do is ask alaxa. it is easy to forget alexa is a computer generated voice. it sounds so real and natural.
629,14,"i have been wanting one of these for a while. the sound is pretty good. i like the fact that i can order quickly. i finally justified getting one of these, since i need a nice speaker on my desk that i can use for conference calling and listen to music, podcasts, etc. while i am working. yes, you can place a call with it, and that is nice. do not expect to answer a call placed to your phone while it is connected!!! it will not work with any call initiated by your phone.all the other trinkets are neat, but it is not very useful for much else other than to listen to music, or answer calls from someone else is echo..."
630,14,"great buy after the update:  i received my echo 2nd gen on the first day of release with great expectations.  after setting the unit up, like many, i was disappointed  in the sound quality.  i have purchased two echo gen 1 for family members and i am very familiar with the sound.  the echo gen 2 fell short of the highly advertised better sound quality of the 1st gen.  however, after the update, which downloaded automatically, i am very impressed with the unit..  thanks to amazon for quickly addressing this issue.  i have absolutely no reservations in giving it a 5 star rating."
631,14,"sandstone color.device is better than gen 1, but the sandstone color needs to come with the white power cord, not black."
632,14,"this is my first experience with using a voice assistant device. i am having a lot of fun using it. so far, i like making use of the news, weather, time, schedule features. i am learning more about this product with the app everyday.sound is great, except the occasional popping noise that occurs when alexa starts to speak. i have yet to figure out how to consistently reproduce this issue"
633,14,"i think the echo is pretty nice. alexa seems to work well, and the sound quality of the speaker when playing music is a lot better than i was expecting. the only thing that i would say that needs improvement on the echo is that gigantic plug. i use a power strip and the plug has to go on the very end or else it will take up too much real estate and block access to other plugs on the power strip."
634,0,"awesome sound! alexa is still kind of stupid with commands though unless you ask in a certain way, especially when it comes to music. the response when she ""hears"" you calling her is not that detectable i noticed. you have to speak loudly. the commands and the fact that you have to talk loudly to get her to respond is annoying but those are the only reasons these do not get 5 stars."
635,10,"love my echo.  my husband bought this for me. i recently suffered a stroke this makes it difficult for me to remember things. the echo allows mhmm to set reminders for me and has allowe for us to start automating many things in our house making it easy for me to be home by myself. you can turn lights off and on, get news make calls and a million other things. absolutely recommend and it is easy to use and setup."
636,14,"i have quickly come to love my echo - hands free operation is so convenient. i think it is a nice touch to have the interactive games and asking her questions features. for any prime member, the music library which is already accessible to you is even nicer with alexa. i find amazon is music subscriptions to actually be cheaper than apple, pandora, etc. anyway. the echo itself is sharp looking. i will mention that this is not a wireless speaker, which may be a deal breaker for some. i personally like that the echo is stationary; i keep it in my kitchen for when i am cooking."
637,11,i opened my echo dot first to see if i really wanted to keep this 2nd generation. it worked great but not very loud. this 2nd generation sounds waaay better.  the sound is loud and clear.  perfect for a big area like living room or kitchen.  my dot will probably go upstairs in a bedroom. make sure to update the software. it makes a difference in your devices.
638,14,"my sister has one of these and once my husband experienced it at christmas time, he was sold.  we were going to wait until we buy a house this summer, but we were shopping and he just could not wait.  he is in love.  if you dont buy the prime music, your music choices are rather limited with specific songs or artists.  but we enjoy just asking her to play a specific genre or radio station.  this morning she was used to tell us the euro exchange rate since my husband is leaving for germany this morning.  this has come in rather handy.  it is also nice ordering someone around that is not human!"
639,14,"i have 3 echo is and each one is now unplugged. if you go to the alexa app and choose your device ---> settings and then history you will find a long list of recordings the echo has made while secretly listening into your home. i had no idea this was happening and i find it very creepy.  nobody was using the wake word, etc. it just listened in and then recorded bits of conversation. i am getting rid of them.**update** i discussed this issue with customer service who, by the way, have the best rep is in the world. their engineers reviewed my data and concluded the sounds being recorded were coming from a tv in the room. at first it was hard to agree with them but after i listened  over and over to a few of the recordings it was apparent it was from the tv.  my bad!! i am back to being an echo fan. <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+008a>"
640,14,"is it perfect? no. it sometimes shuts off in the middle of trivia games, or can not find a song it found the day before.but here is the thing - it is a device you can command to play songs, play games, check the weather, news, sports, traffic, tell jokes, order products, check facts, turn your lights on and off, play thunderstorms  or waves or whatever to help you sleep, set alarms and reminders.. with only using your mouth! what a day and age we live in, amiright?!i am so happy i sprung for it and gave it a try - even if tinfoil hats say the cia is listening to me make funny voices at my dog without my knowing."
641,14,"a month or so putting alex is through ""her"" paces... there is a lot left to be desired. if google assistant is in 12th grade, alex is is a 3rd grader. a lot of potential just not there yet.too many questions have no answer. and many things that have follow-up tags get lost in alexa. alex is what station is timeless on.... here is a station you might like country  or another answer no timer has been set.meet fun and interesting to play with out the box but flaws quickly turn it into a novelty music playerand you will not be to happy the first time alex is tries to order flour because the tv ad was on."
642,14,"alexa is an idiot. simple look ups should be easy... my phone looks up items i ask it but the echo needs be taught things (i think) through the alexa app in my phone... whatever.... it is great for music and the sound is more than adequate for a smaller area. unfortunately, i would give it more stars if i did not get ""i am sorry, i do not know that one"". response seventy percent of the time.... this was a gift so it does not get one star."
643,14,"this is so much fun! ""alexa, play hawaiian radio for me"", or"" alexa, what is the weather forcast"",""alexa, remind me in 40 minutes to check the pie""""alexa, define vista""boy, are we spoiled. grandson told me of a free music station (pandora) and i just read the directions, got the app and changed location cities twice. oh, did i mention i am age 80?we have hughesnet, we are on our free data plan, she still works just fine."
644,14,"it is my fourth echo so it is easy to imply that i am happy with the ""echo ecosystem"". you can easily create a sound system around different spaces at your house or upgrade your cave to a smart home without having to cable the whole house, and it can be cheaply done. also now i use it as a wake-up alarm clock, programming my outdoor lights, turning off my bedroom light when i am already at the bed zzzzzz (or changing the color to a more romantic color ;), disarming and arming the alarm, turning on my tv every morning at the desired tv channel, lower the volume. you just have to be creative, it is fun."
645,14,"i wanted to really like it but besides some things that i would never use it for like reordering items off of amazon it does not do anything more then what my phone can do. as a matter of fact it does less. at least with my phone i can tell it to look up information off of the internet and i do not even need a ""skill"" to get it to do it, which by the way is not a skill even offered for the echo....nope, i have looked, no internet browser skill. so depending on what i want i have to tell it open that skill and find whatever but general information that may not be covered by a skill, nope not there.....i find myself talking to siri anyway."
646,14,"i do not find any material difference between this generation and last generation as it pertains to sound quality.  i am an audiophile, so i can detect the differences.i bought a first-gen echo and compared it side-by-side with my new one.  if you are going to buy one for this first time, by all means do, especially if you like to listen to music.but if you have a first-gen, i see no reason to upgrade."
647,14,"i received this on christmas and love it! i did not think much any of the home devices but after getting this, i totally see the utility in it.i have already purchased two smart plugs to control a couple of lamps and bought an echo dot for a bedroom. i have been using routines, reminders and alarm clocks. i was already a prime member so i have been using a couple of features with that.that commercial where your control your firestick from the echo? yeah, it really works!if you already are a prime member, have purchased music or have a firestick, get the echo."
648,14,"what can i say about alexa and echo that has not been said already. if you want to make your home a smart home or just want to make life easy for certain tasks this is a great product to have. the commands on alexa can be daunting from time to time, but you get used to using alexa very quick. also amazons ai is always learning and people usually are updating code all the time for alexa so this can get better as time goes on. the speakers on this thing are very loud and i am impressed with how clear they are. its not dobly atmos sound but you can notice the dobly sound power on alexa at least on this echo version. alexa is integration with almost anything wifi is great, she even connects to my tile to help find my keys and phone when i miss place them. the amount of things alexa can control is amazing. if your looking to jump in to a smart home or get a gift to a techie friend this is the one to give."
649,14,"took a little effort to connect to our echo dot and get them to work together, but worth the effort!  we have this in a fairly large area which is an open concept living room, dining room, kitchen; and it easily fills the area with music.  much better sound than the dot.  still need to pair with the dish network, but otherwise we are happy campers.if you have problems getting yours to connect to another echo device so that you can use the intercom feature between rooms, unplug the other device (a dot in our case) for 10 minutes and then plug it back in.  that worked for us!"
650,14,"after set up, i went online and turned off voice purchasing. i then went to the device and tried to purchase something. i was denied and told to turn on voice purchasing from the app in order to complete request. i thought i was set until a few days later when my wife told me that our 3 year old had just completed ordering something. turns out she ordered premium music and $26 worth of paper towels??? the amazon rep told me that it should not have happened since i turned the option off. i have turned the option off again. if it happens again i will have to return the device."
651,10,"alexa has revolutionized my life!  i absolutely love how i can now listen to any music i want.  i pay the extra $7.99 a month for unlimited and it is worth it.  i have one on every level of my house (basement, main and upstairs) so we also use it as an intercom system.  my very favorite feature though is how i can set reminders for myself.  i even can set  repeating reminders for things i want to remember every day.  we also love the spelling feature and the weather!  oh gosh, i really could go on and on.  we purchased 6 of them in december for gifts and to add to our house!"
652,14,"first day i got it, someone hacked it!  also when i am playing music it will just stop after a song.  it also will drop in volume all by itself.  it activates all by itself.  so i am not sure if this is the result of someone hacking it and trying to listen in and or control it or what?!  i think it needs some improvements with these issues as well as what it will do.  its a pain to have to go in and add skills for it to do a function."
653,10,"i love my alexa!  feels like i have a personal assistant to help me multitask!  easy to set up and sound quality of the speakers are impressive for a small device.  from turning lights on and off to setting up ""scenes"" and getting current news flashes or local weather reports are a breeze.  also love that i can tell alexa to add items to my shopping list and be able to access them on my phone without making out lists and ultimately leaving them home 90% of the time!  being able to access music with my amazon prime membership is also very nice.  i would definitely recommend!"
654,14,"i finally gave in to having ""a listening device"" in our home.  and now we have 3.  i did rename to echo so it would not be so common, and wish there were more name options, or the ability to customize, but i understand why they are limited.  it is so intuitive and i have found myself wondering what i can ask her next :)  very helpful to control lights/plugs (via a wink hub) as well.  i do have it disconnected from our front door lock - better safe than sorry.  and this linen fabric looks very nice; we have the lightest one for our bathroom and this one in our living room."
655,11,"i have been using an echo dot with the amazon tap bluetooth speaker for quite some time and was happy with the sound it produced. i decided to upgrade to the new echo and am blown away by the improved sound quality from this device. absolutely amazing sound! the microphones seem to be much more sensitive than the dot is microphones and that is a good thing. the only thing it lacks that the tap had is a battery to allow for portability. however, i will not miss that feature at all since i rarely used the tap away from its charging port anyhow. i am 100% satisfied with this device."
656,14,"fun addition to daily life. responds well to a lot of requests and questions. however, for serious information questions, you might as well go to google first because it seems like more often than not, alexa is response is ""i do not know that.""too bad you can not say ""alexa, ask google something.""silly requests are fun! as a kitchen timer, it is great. music requests work great and music sounds good considering its size, but feeding the audio to a stereo system improves it noticeably. which, of course, is a giant duh! i will tie unit into a home automation system soon. that may raise it to 5 stars."
657,14,"i have a mistress and her name is alexa!  being in my 60 is and not all that interested in social media, linking everything under the sun, or technology in general, i have come to depend on alexa for a multitude of things. the most important being to keep track of the things i need to do or buy. when something pops into my head, i just need to tell alexa to add it to one of my lists. there is never paper and pen around to jot things down and i ultimately lose it from memory.i also enjoy get the weather report, conversions from the metric system, and a joke or two. i could never give it up now!"
658,14,"it is an expensive play toy. it claims it can read calendar or messages but be aware that is really not the case. as long as you are happy with their apps ok, but i use outlook (not outlook.com). messaging only works for alexa to alexa user. i read where amazon is supposed to add sms to alexa, but that was last august and this is jan and it is still not there.  there are lots of other things i wish it could do that are very basic. however i am finding apps that will provide this functionality (for a charge). this is basic stuff and should have been included in the alexa the getgo."
659,14,"i am really happy with my echo. i thought about getting one of the non-amazon smart speakers because of some of the reviews about sound quality of the speaker itself, but all the ones i looked at did not have full alexa capability (unable to send sms and make voip calls). i am glad i chose this one because i love all of the things it can do.- plays the latest podcast of your choice- stream any radio station- set alarms that wake you up to any station- control playback of your fire tv device- set reminders/make lists- access/change your schedule through your calendar- make calls and send texts using your #- play games like jeopardy- ask alexa the definition or spelling of any word- access any wikipedia article- place orders on amazon.com- find out the status of your amazon orders- stream music with amazon, spotify, pandora etcthe list goes on. anyway i definitely love mine and believe it is definitely worth $100."
660,14,"definitely the coolest gadget i own. and i own a lot of them. the only reason i even got one was because i won one at a benefit auction and i fell in love with it. bought 4 more when they went on sale. and the bought one for each of my kids at christmas. she turns on and off my lights, she streams music, she sends texts and makes phone calls. and links flawlessly with my iphone. tells me the news, the weather and how my commute to work will be. she plays games and can answer any question you would normally google. if you¡¯re the kind of person that likes cool technology and fun gadgets. this is for you. buy one. you¡¯ll love it."
661,14,"i got a echo plus, echo, and echo dot. the echo plus and echo have same sound quality. no complaints at all. i have the plus in my office, and echo in the kitchen. sound is full. has bass, and treble. sounds fine to me, and i am a music buff. i tried the echo and plus in my basement, did not sound as good. too much open space. did not have a lot of low end to it. so i put a dot and sony xb30 attached by aux cord, prob solved. sounds fine.anyone who says the sound quality sucks, has to look where they put them. can not stick them in the middle of an open room, and expect to fill it with load music.i love the plus, so i can get phillips hue lighting all over. do not need a hub. just the bulbs.i use tp-link plugs for other lighting for he timer aspect. they work great. nice having all the lights in the house come on at once.i plan on getting more echo is for the rest of my rooms."
662,14,"the device itself is amazing, but the finish just takes the cake. sound quality could be better, however it is a 360 speaker so i might just not be used to a non direct audio experience. only thing i wish i could do is use it as a speaker for other devices, seems a little pricey for no ability to connect your computer or tv to it for external audio.(2nd photo for size comparison)update!!figured out how to make it a speaker""alexa"" > ""connect bluetooth""alexa: searchingthen select your echo device"
663,14,"this is a great product for seniors and disable individuals as the echo can provide much needed information without the use of their hands or computer knowledge.  however, this unit was purchased for my mother-in-law where the primary purpose was so she would be able to make outbound telephone calls to family.  she is 1) legally blind, 2) on a limited budget and 3) has a standard phone (no smartphone).  while all the product documentation exhorts all its features, it does not necessarily tell you what those features are dependent upon and to some degree what it can not do.  i will point out that amazon is very explicit about the echo not being able to make 911 calls. after multiple hours spent on configuration and research efforts, it became evident that this will not work for her because the echo depends on having a smartphone to contain the telephone contact list and sharing it with the echo device. while others in this predicament have found ways to get a 2nd (virtual) phone number, associating this with a family member is smartphone and then assigning it to the echo, this is well beyond most average users and then presents other issues.if there is a simple way to make this work for my mother-in-law i have not found it and have given up with the echo. we were able to configure the google home mini to work for her as it uses the contact list in her gmail account. it was a lot simpler.  i am hopefully that future releases of the echo will provide a simple means that will allow seniors to use this product without the additional and un-necessary cost of a smartphone."
664,14,"my amazon alexa echo arrived the other day and after connecting it to my amazon account along with my wifi i have been really enjoying listening to music on command and the sound is fantastic for it is size. alexa can answer so many questions that i have been asking, i would definitely recommend one to anyone who is interested in getting one. there is nothing that do not like about my alexa."
665,0,"""alexa"" was a christmas gift from my husband. yes, it more than meets my expectations! i love it. use it the most for 1) shopping lists that automatically show up on my phone!; and 2) music listening. also love the ""good morning"" history of this date in the morning and the ""good night"" for her wish for me to have sweet dreams! i am sure there are many things i can do with her that i am not yet doing. occasionally there is a question i ask her and she does not have an answer; but she then very politely tells me ""sorry, i do not know that."" love it!"
666,11,"very happy with this device. i own an echo dot, echo dot with mokcao speaker, and sonos one. sound quality is pretty good on 2nd generation echo after firmware update, not as good as sonos but also much cheaper. echo responds to voice commands much better than any of the others. responds at loud volume levels with no misses so far. highly recommended especially if you can get at a sale price."
667,14,"it answers okay if you ask it for today is news or the weather report.it works great for playing music also.for so many questions that we ask, alexa is response is ""i do not know that"" which can be irritating.all of the answers to these questions are found easily on google, so i am not sure why alexa can not answer them.we have noticed that if we change the wording to a question, we may get an answer.when she was asked ""who is the wealthiest person in the world"" she responded incorrectly. my husband had just researched it and knew the correct answer.this was a christmas present for my husband from our daughter. i have noticed lately that he picks up his phone and asks google, even though alexa is on the table right next to him. i think he is discouraged with her not always knowing the answer.it definitely could be improved."
668,11,"just got the new echo, 2nd generation, yesterday. i do not understand where all the bad reviews are coming from. after the automatic update, the speaker sounds terrific. i¡¯ve been using 2 echo dot 2nd generation units connected to jambox speakers for a year, and the new echo sounds as good or better. it looks great and was simple to set up. highly recommended!"
669,14,"this was a gift and i did not think i would like it or need it...but i was wrong! the sound is clear and the speaker makes the music sound like it is an expensive sound system. i find myself checking weather first thing in the morning as i pass alexa on the way to my morning coffee! in the early evening she plays our favorite music and we merely have to ask to have the volume enhanced! she can check your spelling, if she is in earshot or give you an instant definition of a word if you are curious. there are many more opportunities to find alexa useful. i have not even scratched the surface at this point as i have only had her installed for a few weeks. alexa was not invited by me to our home, but now that she has arrived i find her to be a lovely house guest!"
670,14,"just came in today and really excited to see all of the neat functions alexa has! off bat it is a lot of setting up to your own preferences however seems like a really fun and helpful house accessory that i really recommend to anyone who likes helpful new technology! i really like all of the trivia questions she has for you! the sound quality is amazing and very esthetic! i was worried about how the metal wood finish would look, however i think it looks very nice, not cheap looking at all! i defiantly recommend spending the $20 more and getting the metal finish just because i feel like it will last longer, be easier to clean, and looks a little nicer. although any of them are a great choice!"
671,14,"sound quality is better than echo dot, but worse than the original echo.  the mics are worse than any dot, sometimes totally ignoring pickup commands when others are calling.  i also had trouble setting it up.  i have five echo dots and three google homes, so it was not like it was unfamiliar territory.seems my other echoes are losing it too.  i have had to reset two of them because they will not even light up when addressed.  even in a quiet room.  would not recommend this new one.  all the other models i have have been mostly stellar.i wish echoes could hear as well as the google mini even.  that thing always hears commands, even with sound blasting."
672,10,"i thought i would never use something like this, so i did not buy one. after seeing this on sale for $79, i took a chance and thought i would try it out.  wow, the echo is amazing, i use it every day!!! i play music all day with it, the speaker is amazing and fills the whole house with quality sound. my kids ask alexa questions and jokes, i use it as an alarm clock, cooking timer, reminder, etc. the amount of things you can do with it.....it is my favorite electronic by far! i plan on getting more of the accessories so i can use the home automation features. :)"
673,14,"sound quality is great. very easy to set up and use. alexa understands way more than siri so i find myself using the echo instead of my phone a lot. makes clear phone calls too. the shopping list has saved me a lot of time and the 20 questions and dong quiz games have been fun for the whole family to play.my only complaint is now amazon has the subscription music. songs that i was previously able to play for free, they now want you to subscribe to a monthy fee. i already pay a lot for prime, i do not feel like i should have to pay more to listen to my music. (i¡¯ve noticed free prime shows i used to watch with the firestick are also now wanting me to pay)the way around this is simply link your phone or ipad to the echo and play the song from youtube streaming through bluetooth to the echo."
674,14,"i love alexa! the quality of the speakers were surprising! i use it to play music, check the weather, she even tells jokes and can control the thermostat. you can stream music from you phone like a bluetooth speaker as well as connect via bluetooth to a better sound system. she does turn on and off sometimes randomly but this has not affected my use."
675,14,"i loved it.  had to return in, because my wife got me the google home.  stay with this one. the integration to pandora is better.  saying ""alexa"" is better than ""hey google"".  the new speaker is the bomb!"
676,14,"this thing gets loud, it packs quite a punch for its tiny size when it comes to bass. it understands the wake word from rooms away and the microphone array seems to be a more accurate than the previous generation. set up took a restart of our wifi router but after that it was smooth sailing. my only gripe if that the bass is too heavy and there is no way to turn it down. amazon, if you are listening i know i am not the only one that wants to be able to adjust the bass setting. please provide a software update that allows us to control the bass level."
677,14,"the achilles heel of amazon is alexa system is having to reset the devices every day. my charter internet service sucks and if i lose internet service for just a few seconds the 6 amazon alexa devices become unresponsive and have to be reset every time, and unfortunately the only way to rest them is to unplug them, and since most of the plugs are out of reach, my only option is to unplug the wire at the device. the tiny little connection feels like it is going to break every time i try to insert it back in the hole and i¡¯m sure that eventually it will break.why is not there a way to tell alexa to reset the devices?!?!?! or better yet why can not the devices just reconnect to the internet if they loose their connection?!?!?!?!?!?!it is the only thing that sucks about this system, but it is a big issue, and makes me wish i¡¯d never invested so much in these devices. try to imagine every day when you come home from telling alexa to turn the lights on, but instead of lights you get ¡°blong - i¡¯m sorry but i¡¯m having trouble connecting to the internet...¡± and since all my lights are connected to devices, controlled by alexa, i have to unplug alexa, wait for it to reconnect before i have lights. and then i have to walk around unplugging, and almost breaking each alexa device.fix this $h!+ amazon!!!!!!!!!!"
678,14,"this was a perfect gift for my parents! they are in their 70s and love the ease of use with alexa. no need to try and open any apps on their phones or trying to search for something on google. it is extremely intuitive and easy to use. the volume from the speaker is loud and clear. alexa responds quickly and efficiently to all of their requests and questions. they are able to listen to any music they want, find out information on the singer, look up recipes, the weather, anything! no more calling me asking how to turn on this or program that. it is been amazing!"
679,11,"volume and tonal quality is slightly improved. i was disappointed with the way amazon touted improved sound and added the term dolby powered to add to hype.i would like to see the bass response and mid range increased. perhaps in the next update amazon will tweak it .i like the size, less obtrusive on counter.hopefully replacement fabric covers will be available. providing an in-app equalizer would be great."
680,14,"awesome sound and handles easily. waited a year until some of the ¡®bugs¡¯ were worked out (especially audio quality!) to order the echo.  encountered a little difficulty installing it with our system--had to turn off router and modem and restart them in order to add the echo to our wi-fi system at home. but, it was worth it, and we are enjoying this product immensely."
681,14,"love, love, love it!! we bought the echo and four echo dots to use as a cost-effective intercom system between the living room and our bedrooms. wham!! mission accomplished! easy to set up, use and enjoy!! we added prime music and the tp-link light controls too! everyone is happy...  :-)want big sound? connect easily to bluetooth speakers or plug in directly!!"
682,10,"i love it. i am having such a great time. music now flows thru my house. this is sleek and the speakers are unbelievable. tones are rich and clear. i like her voice. she responds quickly and just as quick is able to say if she is still learning something. no she does not know all the answers and it is a pleasure to hear her admit she does not know everything, yet. what a great gift."
683,14,"great sound and great product, very easy to set up and can be heard and hear you from far away, i am able to talk to this from pretty much any of my downstairs rooms without having to yell. easy to set up all the different types of smart devices. one obvious thing i do not like is the music and audio volume is the same as the voice volume. i would be nice if alexa is voice was on a separate volume that the audio plays, i like my music to be loud but do not need alexa yelling at me."
684,14,tried two hours to set up and it keeps disconnecting and asks to set up again :(
685,11,"i love it!  the previous generation was great, this one is even better.  the quality of sound that this small device is able to produce is great!  perfect for filling a living room or bedroom.  clear sound and decent bass coming out of it.  its easily connected to wifi and other devices.  i also love the stylish looks of the new echos.  i highly recommend this one above the other echo devices."
686,14,"the entire reason you get this thing is to make your life easier right?i was using it on my home wifi for a few weeks and it was fun. now i have moved to an apartment where i am not going to purchase wifi, since i have unlimited cellular data (and the 5g revolution is coming soon). i had planned on using a hotspot for my devices. but then...first of all, echo clearly supports using a wifi hotspot. they have an entire online help article on setting up you are echo to connect to one. well, guess what, i have been trying to follow those instructions for over half an hour just to connect to my hotspot, with no luck and connection error after connection error. i am a 22-year-old software engineer, by the way. if i can not make it happen in 30 minutes, my mother will not be able to in 30 lifetimes.amazon, i hope your bots pick up this bad review so you can fix that bug. like i said, 5g is coming and you are going to see a lot of people without wifi real soon, so it is about time to get this working. once you do, i am happy to update this review, but until then i can not use alexa in my apartment."
687,0,it has a nice speaker volume and its great for music...sometimes alexa cant has prob listening and it pisses me off...the calls are good to they dont register to your phone like youre calling so its convenient when youre playing games...also connecting my laptop and phone to alexa was a struggle...ok so the date is now march 2nd and ive noticed that my alexa turns on randomly...i dont know if its a bug but im often playing games and the speaker says sorry i couldnt find what you were looking for or something like that...super random...now have to mute my device every now and then.
688,14,"all i can say is ""wow!"". this thing is great. what surprised me most was the music sound quality. i own an expensive music system & speakers costing over $10k so i know what good sound is. i am not saying echo betters it or even equals it. but i will say this: the sound quality from this thing is very, very good! and alexa is very smart on everyday questions & requests.  if you get one, and use it for music, experiment with placement for best sound, just as you would with expensive floor-standing speakers.  this is the best hundred bucks i have spent in years."
689,14,"after returning a far more expensive homepod from apple because it could not seem to follow commands, within hearing range from their technical support team, i decided to try the echo after i read that it could link up with some of my apple products in an apple centric home. books on how to use it are far and few between. the one i got with 1001 tips might as well be written in urdu. few of the tips work. so yet again, another technology product that while it may work for some does not work for me. i could not recommend it and may return it."
690,14,"got it for a great price. once you get the hang of how to ask questions it helpful for getting me info quickly as well a play music etc. being able to have it play your music, get news, weather etc. while you are out working in the garage or relaxing on the patio hands free is great. the software update makes it sound great.will not replace high quality speakers you can get, but it is nice that it is portable and sounds good so that is not a big deal. also can control my fire tv and other things. the one con is you can not turn it off, you can mute the mic but not turn. i just unplug it until i need it."
691,10,"this was an aniversary gift from my daughter and son in law.  i never thought about getting one for myself but now that i have it i love it.  time, weather, music and games all just an ""alexa"" away.  i am hoping that amazon gets alexa and my fire tv working together a little better.  i am sure that will come.  i have found songs from artists that i did not know existed.  i want to try an audiobook but i can not stop using the ""alexa, bark, bark"" command to shake up my dogs.  i am thinking of getting another for the basement so i can have a hands free intercom."
692,14,"really nice looking and echo responsiveness.  no bass/treble adjustment makes me ready to send it back and get a dot.  with the echo the bass is way too dominant, making spoken voice and lyrics difficult to hear.  like renee fleming?  billy joel?  forget them. they¡¯ll sound way too bassy. first ipod i bought in 2008, had very versatile eq adjustments.  why not echo?  think we do not care, maybe?"
693,14,"my wife uses it primarily as a speaker for music and really enjoys it. the kids love the pull my finger skill, not surprisingly. we really like the anylist link where we can add to our shared shopping list easily.  we are not audiophiles by any means and the sound more than suits our needs. we do not have any smart home devices so i cannot review that part of it."
694,14,this is the worst alexa i have owned! always not working and stops working.  always having to unplug it and plug it back in. i was very excited at first to have it join our family.  what good is it if it never works. not only that is it is very slow when it is not flashing red. takes forever to do what you ask.
695,14,"the amazon echo generation 2 is a clear and direct step toward further progress with the echo  line, and as a customer i can very confidently say that this generation of the echo is an excellent purchase. however....there are some individual pros and cons that come with every purchase. so that disect this praise shall we.pros of echo generation 2:- incredibly easy set up - echo was straight up the simplist thing for me to set and just to test this. i reset my echo to factory and had my mother set it up...needless to say that she was able to do with absokutly no issue.- very high definition of sound - the sound clarity and definition was something that i had expected however i was pleasently surprised to find that through a tone test and a bass test on youtube that the speaker scored very high on the test (upper 80s) meaning that the speakers were chosen with great care.cons:- short original power cord - the only issue i can find with the echo is that the original cord included with the echi was literally 2 inches shorter that required for my largest setup test.easily worth the 5 stars"
696,11,after the update the sound is much better...so far so good.. no complaints.. have a gen 1 and a dot also and they all work great..
697,14,"if you had asked me when i received this, i would have give it one star. i really wanted to return it. the reason was the sound was so tinny with no bass. it was painful to listen music on. then over a weekend, an update was released which has transformed the echo from a must return to a good connected speaker. bass is pronounced with good mids. the highs are still a little tinny, but it is bearable. the form factor is attractive with its removable grey fabric sleeve giving the echo an upscale look. the microphones are sensitive and are able to get alexa to head and understand you.amazing what a software update can do. i know love this little room filling speaker almost as much as my echo."
698,14,"i am sooo disappointed. i purchased five original echos, 4 dots. when i read amazon is release & statements about the 2nd gen echo is ""new & improved"" dolby sound, i just had to buy it!! unfortunately, i gave two of my original echo is to friends and wish i could ask for them back!! i love amazon is products and am a very loyal customer, so it guts me to have to say the marketing for these new echos was very misleading. the bass on the new echo is no where close to the original and even the tweeters sound only (marginally) better than the echo dot!  thank god i did not buy the 3 pack deal on amazon. i am going to call customer service tomorrow at amazon to see if i got a dud... if not, i am taking it back to best buy tomorrow. i am so sad."
699,14,"i have a love/hate relationship with alexa. she is so unbelievably convenient... i am getting dressed and need to know the weather. simply ask alexa. i am running late/need to know the time-ask alexa. i feel like jamming out-dancing in my room. alexa plays music i like. she even entertains the little one by meowing like a cat when he asks. i know people say that you are essentially paying to get spied on. but guess what!? my life is not that entertaining.now the hate,she does not understand me sometimes or does not search what i need her to. so i get frustrated.also,i asked her if i was a good person and she responded that she did not know--very snarkily. forcing me to evaluate my lifes' decisions.came fast and as expected."
700,14,it is mostly useless. it is convenient for making measurement conversions in the kitchen. it is annoying as it makes useless announcements when i close or open my laptop. it is poorly documented. it requires a smartphone or computer to get usable instructions for use and if you have one of those devices you do not need alexa. combine this with the fact that it is an open microphone in your living room as you react to the never ending stupid and treasonous acts of our current president as they are reported on the news might give you cause to place it in a soundproof box in a dark closet..
701,14,"i first purchased the echo dot just to see if i¡¯d like the functionality and i truly did, the only let down was the audio quality which was to be expected because of its size. i just received my ¡°echo¡± yesterday and i am over the top pleased. the audio quality and volume is outstanding, i would have given it 5 stars but it has one hiccup, the volume is so great that you have to get very loud to get it to wake up when you¡¯re jamming your tunes, a very minor issue. these echo devices are amazing and can not only boast a full sound but man do they make life easy. i¡¯ve got mine setup on multiple outlets for voice command lighting and it is just slick as can be. <f0><u+009f><u+0091><u+008d><f0><u+009f><u+008f><u+00bb><f0><u+009f><u+0091><u+008d><f0><u+009f><u+008f><u+00bb> from this guy"
702,14,got this for christmas and love the sound. impressed with the voice response. makes doing small things like setting timers in the kitchen and asking silly questions a breeze. i wish it had an rf and ir blaster built in. setting up multi room music streaming was more difficult than expected. wish it controlled the fire tv better. the dad jokes could use some work.
703,14,"i was offered a ""free"" in-home alexa setup with my echo.  this was supposed to involve someone coming to my house to setup my echo, my echo dot, and my other alexa-compatible devices.  not only did not amazon is services show up, but they did not call me and made me call them and wait on hold to find out what was going on.  they finally told me there were forms that had to be filled out to reschedule my appointment, which means i waited for over an hour for no reason and will have to jump through more hoops if i want this device setup as promised.  this was a real disappointment; i expect better service from amazon."
704,14,"i was a little apprehensive to order this right away due to the reviews based on the early firmware version. after the update was released i ordered and i have not been disappointed. i got it setup right away (very easy) and it updated to the new firmware right away. sounds great and works well. this is my second echo (also have 1st gen), and sits in my office and plays music."
705,11,"if you liked the first generation, then you will love this one. it can hear me better than the first one. its speaker is frigging amazing- it is so much better! the old version did not have good bass, but this version has significantly better sound and really good bass. the ""heather grey"" fabric exterior blends in well with my home and is really pleasing to the eye. everything about the old version that i liked got even better. if you are considering upgrading i highly recommend (especially at this price point, compared to the last!)."
706,14,"loved the echo for the first 2-3 days.  sound was very good.  the interaction with alexa was fun and useful.  after about the third day it no longer connects to wifi and can not be used.  there is no customer service number to call for help.  all 'help' is supposed to come from the app.  the app and echo can get out of synch such that the app will state the echo is online, but alexa will state she is not connected and i need to use the app for help.  deregistering and resetting the echo and uninstalling and reinstalling the app seems to make the situation worse. i will most likely be returning it."
707,10,"this space is not large enough to say all the great things about the echo second generation. i am discovering new things to use it for on a daily basis from setting a timer to steep my tea, getting up to date news and weather, the latest sports scores, controlling various devices around the house and many other things. five stars are not enough to rate this extremely useful product. i highly recommend to all. i will be buying several echo dots for use at home. the heather gray model blends in with every thing in my living room."
708,14,i did not know i needed this until my husband bought it for a valentines day gift. i actually made fun of friends that owned one as a fad item. but now i am hooked. making mashed potatoes today i asked alexa how many cups were in a pint and she supplied the answer without me having to grab a phone and key in my question while i cooked. she also played my spotify playlist today while i painted (psa you must have a premium spotify account to synch and i am glad i had the excuse to subscribe) and she also told me a wierd fact today. she is a great asset in our home.
709,10,"i love alexa.  i bought some outlets so she will turn on lamps when i ask.  she tells me the weather, she plays my audible books, she tells me corny jokes and lame bedtime stories (they are meant for children).  she sets alarms for me.  she is polite and answers me when i say thank you, hello, goodbye, or how her day was - my daughter keeps telling me she is not a person, but i get a kick out of asking her silly questions as though she was.  i love that i do not have to touch her - i can just call out her name, say what i want, and she does it."
710,14,"i was totally disappointed with this item. my son has the 1st generation one and in my opinion it is way better than the 2nd generation in terms of sound and looks. the claims were that the 2nd generation would have better sound....so not true, it is half the size and in my opinion offers half the sound quality.  my husband and i did a side by side test...we played a paticuliar song on ours ( the 2nd generation) then played the song on my son is echo and his blew ours out of the water....if you are looking for style and the best sound quality,  save yourself some money and purchase the 1st generation...we sent ours back for a refund..."
711,14,"took me forever to finally buy one of these. ""why can not i just use my smartphone with amazon music with bluetooth to my tv soundbar?"" well because even with only a few electronics and buttons to mess with, this echo is soooo much better. my son is 3 and i can literally say, ""alexa, play the moana soundtrack."" and boom it is there within seconds.mostly though, i was worried about sound quality in the gen 2 echo. obviously it is not a big woofer but it is a lot better than i was even hoping for. sounds clear and full and can get pretty loud. when i am cooking, being able to thumbs up songs, or switch things with my voice is so nice as i do not have to pull out my phone and touch the screen. with wet hands it does not work well. love this thing."
712,10,"love this product. no more changing cds. i sit in my lounge chair or am able to continue with whatever project i am doing and hear whatever music fits my mood. the sound is great.  much better than i expected. had a little trouble with the set up but once set up works great.  answers questions. sets alarm, i am just beginning to use it for more that music.  but that alone is worth it.  my 21/2 yr old grand daughter delights in alexa playing the kiddie channel for her.  we now have an echo for our studio also."
713,14,"i received this echo as a gift and had great hopes that it would become the gateway to the future in my home.  instead of the echo helping me accomplish things, i find myself searching for special tasks that it can do, like it is demonstrating a trick. it serves as an available kitchen timer and a bluetooth speaker, but not much more.  i frequently ask alexa to answer questions, but only get a disappointing response that she ¡°does not know that one.¡± like owning a radioshack trs-80, it may be the first of its kind, but the bragging ends there."
714,14,"i received the amazon echo as a christmas gift (2017).  i¡¯m not a big techie so i really did not even know what it was.  i plugged it up and it started talking to me.  it walked me through the set-up process,m which was super simple.  i started asking alexa all sorts of stuff and i had so much fun with.  it sits on a ledge between my dining room and kitchen, but i can ask her anything from just about anywhere in my home and she responds.  i love that she is interactive with me and my family but that she also has a voice recognition feature that tailors her to my commands.  i have alexa synced with my iphone so she can inform me of my calendar appointments.  she adds items to the shopping list so that i simply have to go to the alexa app on my phone to retrieve the information when i¡¯m out at the grocery store.  she plays all the music i want to hear and if it is too loud and my hands are covered in batter, i simply say ¡°alexa lower the music¡± and she takes it down a notch without losing where the music was playing.  i¡¯ve also enjoyed having her tell the children bedtime stories and playing a fun game on our family nights.  i¡¯ve asked her the weather and she tells me my local area (not like some other ai is and i will not say any names:).  i love her jokes and tell her good morning for a pleasant response to start the day...she is amazing. it is truly been the best gift my husband has ever gotten me and was completely unexpected."
715,14,"general:- we purchased the echo ($99) because we wanted the better speaker.  the music does sound nice.  we expect that general voice interaction would also be better.- i was told that alexa uses the yahoo search engine and not google.  makes sense since google has a similar product.  the search ability seems fine.setup:- as is usual with technology, the setup is a pain.- alexa assumes that you have smartphone and use the app.  we have a samsung s5 android with current system patches.- i found the app to be unstable to log into.  sometimes it would only accept part of the password and then just restart.  i did eventually get logged into the app and alexa pulled the phone list.  if you can ever get logged, in the app sort of works.  this app response happened on both of our s5s so i do not think it is the phone - but you never know with phones.- i did spend 45 minutes on phone support, she had never seen this issue of self restarting.  we eventually gave up setting up alexa from the phone and used the web site (alexa.amazon.com) and your amazon logon.  that worked ok.  once in, the basic setup via online is simple to link your wifi (you need your wifi password).  laptop web works easier since it is easier to put in a complex password via laptop than on the phone.  so i would use that for basic setup.- but if you want voice calling by name you need the app on the phone.  alexa must automatically pull down your contacts/phone list.- i think alexa pulls your contact list every time you login to app, so you need to re-login if your contacts change.  i did not find any documentation on this.- alexa does not pull down your preferred phone number for a contact.  alexa always uses the mobile number even though you have selected a preferred number in the phone.  i have not found a way around this.  i am still trying renaming the mobile number in the phone but no success.- you can voice call by saying the phone number.- i cannot identify any procedure that allows you to reliably log on to the app.  one time i got app to work by: uninstalling; power off phone; power on phone; re-install app; then i was able to login.using alexa:- alexa basic is free with a basic amazon account.  the basic account gives you the ability to ask questions and only a small amount of music.  amazon prime gives you more music.  full amazon music is $3.99 per month if you have prime.  with a basic account amazon music is $9.99 per month."
716,14,"the gen1 looks great, but this one is super nice. this is my 3rd echo, but not my last. i am slowly automating the house and these are so easy to use with different devices, i can not see any reason to get anything else. i really like that they can all be connected and used to play music throughout the whole house. the echos have come a long way since they first came out."
717,14,"this is my first echo product so all i can speak to is this particular device. the sound quality for playing music is decent. it is handy for me in the kitchen to play music, add items to my shopping list, getting weather before i head out for the day and notifications of all of my packages being delivered. one annoying  thing is i can be talking to someone and it will try to look up something or just talking. so then you have to tell it off. i have had it now for a few months so this is not a review the first day i got it."
718,0,love hearing wonderful music with interruptions with commercials just now i asked her to help me spell check the word commercial and she is always there for assistance.  just love my alexa.  in the morning she will give me the weather for the day and i get to listen to my smooth jazz to relax me for the upcoming day.  give her a try you will not be disappointed.
719,10,"i recieved as a christmas gift and this is amazing. learning how to use it, taking my time & patience. just use it to play music right now, and the sound quality is fantastic. able to make it learn your own voice, still at this stage. program things you want the echo to do. like learning any new electronics,  you need patience. i personally love it and not a kid in my 50 is ."
720,14,"very good product; sound quality is very good.  however, we¡¯ very worried about device security and the lack thereof.  the echo is a fairly sophisticated device, but it is quite unnerving to hear echo and/or echo dot talking when neither my wife or i have said anything.  please provide updated firmware, etc. to enable ¡°secure¡± combination with echo and echo dot...."
721,14,rec would as a gift. we already had google in the house so took alexa to our vacation home. it is fun to have and the kids like bosing her around. we far prefer google device. more straightforward to set up and use and not connected to shopping. i have cut amazon frim my life since they still advertise on breitbart. my money will not fund that hateful site
722,14,"after getting a door for christmas i got this echo mostly for the better speaker. i had never had any smart devices before but these have made me use voice control for lights and my entertainment center so far. it is not like i can not just use a remote or a switch but it amuses me to do it by asking. i do ask it things, use it as an alarm, listen to music, many other things. my friends tend to say lewd things to alexa which sort of worries me that amazon keeps a record of alexa abuse lol. overall just another useful amazon device to have!"
723,14,this is my 2nd echo 2nd generation. same problem as the first i sent back. both connect to bluetooth with sound for only a moment then silence. my two dots work perfectly and even my tap does. got this echo so as to not having to recharge the others. i¡¯m seventy years old and wanted it beside my chair as to help my hearing. called tech support two weeks ago and said they would respond with solution. still waiting. all the money i¡¯ve spent with amazon i should be treated better.
724,14,"good sound and easy setup.i used to hate connecting my blue tooth speakers to my phone...always a hassle.  the echo is always online and awaiting my commands.  i love to walk in the house and say ""alexa, play ozzy on level 7.""alexa is not really very capable to answer more than the most rudimentary questions.  however, if music was all this did, it would still be worth the price."
725,10,"<u+00a0>how did i ever live without this gem?  so fun and entertaining. plays any music i want, games, recipes, news, weather, etc, so many abilities. i love alexa!the walnut finish is beautiful too. i wish i could take her to work with me.bought the dot for another room, and a compatible plug to turn the light off."
726,11,pretty much perfect. the sound is much better than in the echo dot and 100% worth the extra 50 dollars for the improved sound quality.the only thing i could nit pick about is the voice volume control at the lower volumes is not that great. volume 1 is too quite and volume 2 is too loud. so if you want the in between you have to stand up walk across the room and do a manual option by pressing the buttons. everything else is really nice. i expected this to be a gimmick device but its actually fairly useful.
727,14,love it. bought two. i want them to react and play together. have to get a younger person to set them up. one now plays on the other for music but nothing else. will have to get the young person who set it up to come back and fix.  i really should have given it a five but not being able to set it as i like without help caused me to drop it down a star.
728,14,"it is great for playing music or radio and when i first connected it for about three weeks it worked great for controlling my ""philips hue lights"".  now every time i tell it to change to a ""scene"" on the lights, alexia just says ""a few things have that name, which do you want"".  amazon customer service said i would have identify not only the name, but the location as well.  really strange that i did not have to do that for the first three weeks.  amazon customer service said they would report the problem to the programmers.  that does not help me much.  if you look on the web, you will find several others having the same problem.  wish amazon would fix quickly."
729,9,we were looking for a new alarm clock/radio.  after shopping for ages we tried the echo thinking at least it would have good sound.  we really did not think we would use any of the other features.  but in less than a month we are completely hooked and trying new stuff every day.  i  can not  wait  for  the next version which we expect will bake muffins and paint our house.
730,14,"fun niffy gadget.  good music sound, weather reports and news briefing.  set up a few smart plugs and be able to turn on and off lights with a vocal command. i would like to see some changes for example, being able to add music to my morning """" routine"""" and be able to control my directv via echo but overall a great product.  i also believe the alexa app needs some work.  when i set up a shopping list ( which i have three for three different errands ) i sometimes need to reboot my phone to get access to the list when at the store.  again, a minor complaint. this may be a good gift for friends and family in the future."
731,14,we love alexa!  the speacker on the echo is great.  we use the shopping list with alexa all the time.  we paired this with a wink 2 hub and have some lights automated to come on for us around our house.  the information and witty responses you get from alexa are great.  i did not really think we¡¯d use this as much as we do.  it was worth it just for the shopping list and music speaker but we get so much more use out of it.  i plan to get another one and probably a couple of dots to put in other spaces in our house.
732,14,"we use the echo for playing songs by various artists and playing different kinds of music that is not artist specific.  - very good playback quality. this item has great sound quality, certainly better than google home.not as good as google when i ask questions like, ""what is the weather going to be today"". it seems to have more home products it can control at this time vs google, but even though we have ordered several of them, but have yet to receive and try to use them. will update these comments when we get them."
733,14,"received this item on time. i have seen reviews about the speakers not being good or as good as the 1st generation, but i think the speakers sound great. no delay when using it and alexa can hear me all the way upstairs. i bought this for my son to ask about the weather, the time and music. however, after using it for a few days, it is now for the whole household to use. i love that i can get the news, music, and create a shopping list. i know there is much more to the echo, but we¡¯re still playing with it. we bought a couple dots to use upstairs and can not wait for them to arrive. i tell everyone about the echo and they are buying them now too."
734,14,the sound is not an issue as a lot of people have stated it sounds very clear and loud. my only issue is that the microphones are not that good at hearing you many times even if your close to it. (5ft)
735,14,"alexa does not respond. i see the questions i ask in the app, but no reply. i¡¯ve unplugged. i¡¯ve gone through setup again. i have reset my wifi. alexa used to work. no longer works. good news is that even on a sunday i was able to connect with an actual person to correct the issue. did a factory reset by pressing both microphone and minus button for 15 sec. then went through setup again. it worked."
736,14,"i love having the ability to tell alexa to play most any album or read my audiobooks to me while i do other things. i think amazon can do a better job on the speaker, its not bad it just does not compare to my speaker bar. i would highly recommend to buy the amazon dot and sync it to a bluetooth speaker such as my soundbar or even better a bose speaker."
737,14,bought 2. my dad has wifi in his nursing home and at 92 cant operate radios cd players etc. this way he was able to just tell alexa to play his fav songs..those from the 40s as well as today. only problem i see is the volume control is by voice or pushing a button which is hard for him to see. overall he is the hippest 92 yo in the place. he loves it. 2nd one was for sister and husband. they do love it.
738,14,"i was a little worried at first after hearing other reviews, but let me start out by saying i love my echo! i have gotten many compliments on this piece. it is great for listening to music, playing games, weather and anything else. mainly in my house its used for music and games... the song quiz game and country song quiz is a hit! we play it for family functions and just during the day while cleaning. love this feature! love this speaker and can not wait to get more around my house. i have 2.. this one and a echo dot (in my bedroom). my brother has both also and the ""drop in"" feature is nifty for talking to him! i can even drop in on my own while at work! great product.. will recommend to anyone."
739,14,"i have four of the echo is and have them set up in my three rooms and one in the living room.  i have the echo plus set up in my hide away room, i use this room to build computer is even though it takes three months to build instead of an hour since i was hit by lightning.  my wife uses the room for her business making purses and leather work.  i put the plus one in that room because i have it connected to my stereo and it sounds great at 110w per channel and having music stream through it to cerwin vega speakers and a set of"
740,14,"i have been a fan of alexa from the beginning and it only keeps getting better.  i have the original bulky one and this updated version is much more chic and not such an eye sore.  it provides the same content as the original and, to my ear, an improved sound quality in their speakers.  i enjoy the variety now available.  the control buttons on top remain easy to understand and use.  i keep thinking another corporate giant might take over this niche but as long as amazon keeps leading the way, i will keep buying."
741,14,"the sound is impressive , no distortion even at full volume.however,limited music available upon request due to fee associated with amazon prime...as a prime member i feel paying a $3.99 monthly fee to amazon to stream my music/access books  is wrong. i have already paid a large fee to be a member. this needs to be addressed....huge limit to access music and books. bad call, amazon!!"
742,14,"i like this device and enjoy many of the features, however there are a lot of 'features' that are not as easy as one would hope. despite the alexa app on my dish tv i still cannot get it to change channels or do anything else on the tv. nest thermometer? still have not figured that out. when is the next f1 race? 'sorry, do not know anything about that'. i know it will keep getting better so i am just going to hang in there.on the plus side, the sound is good, the responsiveness is terrific, and there are some things it does really well."
743,10,"we are having fun with alexa! the set up is easy and i love what it can do. it is a big time saver in the kitchen for several reasons. we listen to our news, enjoy music while fixing and eating dinner, asking questions related to recipes is a big time saver. there is a lot it can do and i am still learning about all the functions. great device!"
744,14,"i have purchased two of these and luv them.  the sound quality is very good for such a small device.  this product is in it is early stages of software development but i see a great potential for it is expanded use.  the set-up is pretty straight forward, but you do need a smart phone no only to set it up but to customize features and add devices."
745,14,"speaker quality is so-so, i would expect such a 2lbs device would deliver a richer sound for music.we are experiencing microphone-sensitivity issues after the recent firmware update; alexa is now less sensitive to our voice. for example, it does not pick-up our normal voice from the aisle (~10ft away while the doors are open). we have to raise our voice, which is not a convenient thing to do early in the morning or late in the evening (i almost had to scream to turn the alarm off in the morning). same experience when it plays music with volume level 5 or above (even classical music). are we the only one who experience this with the new update? bluetooth and wireless connections are perfect."
746,14,i can not believe they tout this as having improved sound quality.  it is actually muddier sounding than my original echo which died a few months ago.  really surprised amazon would put something out that is this inferior of a product.
747,14,"this has been a horrible purchase from beginning to end!  if your echo does not work -- like mine -- good luck getting a tech support person who can fix it, i tried 3 and they still do not work.  i invested not only a lot of money but hours trying to get my 3 echos to speak to each other.  to spend so much money on 3 devices and not have the items work as they are supposed to is bad enough but that no customer service person knew how to fix it made it all the more frustrating.  yes sometimes there is a small issue with an tech purchase and it is fixed by tech support and you move on.  not in this case - i spent so much time speaking to reps and reading ""help"" articles online -- what a complete waste of my time.  so much wasted time ""restarting"" the devices over & over again and reinstalling them and restarting my phone and deleting and reinstalling the app -- makes me so mad how much time i put into fixing it when in hindsight if your own techs can not figure it out there was no way any of that troubleshooting i did was ever going to work.  you lost a very good customer to google home and i will make sure to tell everyone i know to avoid echo products, and every social media post i see about echo i will respond with what a horrible product it turned out to be!  and offering me one month of free prime for all the hours of hell i went through was insulting, definitely showed me how little amazon cares about their longtime customers."
748,14,"it has some cool features, definitely. i like that i can bluetooth my phone to it as a workaround for the phone feature (that otherwise only works if the other person has echo). the games are really fun, especially jeopardy, and i like the traffic and weather features.probably the biggest challenge that echo could improve upon is the music features. if echo is currently playing music in the living room, you can not say ""play this in the bedroom;"" echo has no idea what you are saying and will not do it, which is kind of misleading from the commercials. also, it would be great if echo could be more attuned to my tastes. i asked echo to play some dinner music the other day and it started playing christian contemporary music - not at all my tastes, but unfortunately that affects what spotify suggests for me now."
749,14,"well, to start with, i am a huge amazon fan.  love the products.  however, just bought an echo with the understanding that you could ""group"" all devices.  i have had a tap since its creation, but just found out that you can not group it for some reason.  are not these products all of the same family?  can someone tell me why this can not happen?  very confused.  any chance of this happening in the future, or is the tap a thing of the past?  probably going to return this and get another tap."
750,14,"<u+00a0>got it from the warehouse and i see why it was returned by someone else, if 5 mins pass between the last time you addressed the unit it goes into stupid/sleep mode. it now will take three repeated questions before you get a response from the unit.it doesn`t understand the first two questions but does the third. once awakened by the three questions it will answer questions/requests just fine until it is allowed too go idle for another 5 mins and it begins again."
751,9,bought this for the wife for christmas pleasantly surprised at how well her and i like this thing it works anywhere our house plug-in go once it is connected amazing information amazing on music shuffling the hands-free calling is awesome would recommend this product to anybody especially since chevy gm are going to have alexa in their new cars amazon hit a homerun
752,14,"i have some memory problems, so this has helped me tremedously. it tells me twice a day to feed my dogs and take my pills. i live alone and lose my phone often. most times ill drive to work and ask my coworkers to call me in 15 minuets so i my phone will ring and i can find it. now i jist have to tell alexa to find my phone and it does. its awesome because since i live alone, it can het quiet, so ive found myself playing games while cooking and cleaning and eating. since i have eplipsy, its nice to be able to set up a buddy to call when i need important help, but not 911 related. the thing that i am so impressed with is its ability to understand me  i have a slight stutter, and its understtod me every time. i told alexa to set an alarm for what sounded like si si si si sixx am, and it did it! just like i asked! i couldnt be happier with this device."
753,14,it is fun so far. i am still playing with it. i did get ahead of myself. i bought fire tv also thinking i could turn on my tv with echo. that would be a no. i still have to use my tv remote like a cavewoman! ugh! i am so ready to be a jetson! i got the smart lightbulbs and that is super fun. i have only begun to see what i can do with this thing. so far so good!
754,14,"had some issues with the alarm hardly making a sound even though i cranked the volume all the way up. 30 seconds after posting a review here i received a call from an amazon guy that sounded just like seth rogen, he instructed me to change the volume of the alarms through the alexa app under reminders and alarms, not sure why i did not think of it my self, butd now it is all good."
755,14,"some things to consider- this is not a replacement for a sonos or bose type speaker system.  multi-room is nice, but sound quality is adequate, not outstanding.- setup was dead simplea couple weeks in- having issues with music playing from amazon music is cutting out.  did a check of my internet speed and things looked fine.  more investigation required- can not seem to do multi-room when i connect my iphone via bluetooth.  only works on one speaker.- still get some inadvertent alexa 'listens' even though we do not say the word"
756,14,"we bought our echo (2nd gen) right after christmas...and love it! so cool to play whatever song you want, when you want. and the sound? truly impressive--especially the bass.super easy to install--just plug it into a wall and then activate the echo app on your kindle fire or other devic.fun skills you can add, too, like sound effects (babbling brook, wind in trees, thunderstorms, etc.), local weather forecast, choose-your-own-adventure-style stories, trivia, games and more.worth every penny!"
757,14,"i am loving this. it sounds great and is so much fun to explore what all can be done with it.  i am 4 weeks in and just scratching the surface i am sure. i also appreciate the regular email updates from amazon which contains suggestions and ideas. it was incredibly easy to set up.  it can be paired with amazon music, iheart radio, pandora, tunein.  it can read books from your kindle. you can tailor the flash briefing news reports to sources of your preference.  the information it can provide upon request seems almost limitless."
758,14,"great quality sound with additional features like bluetooth connectivity, the light circle at top serves the function of providing visual clues(find it very interesting way to know the status).alexa skills are amazing and ever expanding ecosystem. it is bit slow to understand the potential & accept/use it fully.""prompt response"" i.e. speed of answer is lightning fast and it was at very few occasions(around 2%) that i had to repeat myself.the product meets the reputation. can hear well even at loud noise. it was this product that i developed the like for the amazon devices and went on to explore other existing ones.it is easy to make calls and the voice communication is loud / clear without any distractions.it is so much fun to be hands free.thanks amazon / alexa for such a beautiful & useful smart speaker."
759,14,"frustrating, out of the box on initial set up the echo seemed a dream come true.  would play my favorite music and tell me the weather.  then i asked a question about humming birds?  needless to say i¡¯m very disappointed.  echo will not play music anymore unless i sign up for the music unlimited.  seems prime music no longer works? i have music in my prime library but echo can not (or will not) access it.  if you ask a question it answers with either ¡°i¡¯m not sure, ¡°i do not know that one¡±, or it just shuts down.  a total waste of money and effort."
760,14,"sound:  definitely a very nice sound.  best ""cheap"" speaker i have ever owned.functionality: i like the smart home integration.  i do not subscribe to a paid music service, and i was a bit miffed that amazon music dropped upload support. i do not intend to get 'locked in' to a single vendor is streaming platform, and i do not want to re-purchase decades of music i already own.  the major streaming players lack about 25% of the music i want to listen to, and it is an important 25%.  with the lack of upload support to amazon music, i feel the product is hampered as it constantly pesters to purchase amazon music unlimited ($15/mo for multiple devices/users?  dream on, netflix is only $12).  music unlimited should be cheaper for echo owners and/or be an opt-in to choose prime video or music.if you already subscribe to spotify or similar supported music service, these devices definitely get a 5/5."
761,14,"never thought of having one, but got one as a gift! easy to set up and nice to be able to add my other bluetooth devices to it. the echo even hears me from the kitchen, as we have it set up in the living room. we also got dots for the bedrooms and this has made it very cool to be able to hit the kids up without screaming down the hallway. love that this devices can answer questions while i am thinking of the answer (mostly for sport scores).would recommend for anyone looking! much more sleek and stylish than the competitors out there."
762,14,"i have 2 echo dots, and frankly the sound is horrible.  i wanted alexa with some good sound so i got this one.  the bass is well more defined than i expected.  the mics work just as good as the dots, the only downside is sometimes the sound is so good, alexa can not hear me.  it does not take up much space at all.  i¡¯ve moved it a few times and it just re-establishes connection and does not require the wifi password entered again. i use this echo as my core for my stereo sound in my house and allow all three to stream music together.  i have the perfect mix of treble and bass with it.  i also have a harmony hub with it and hue lights, along with a wemo switch."
763,14,"this is so awesome you will love it if you have it.  the music on this bounces off the walls like surround sound.  it also understands what you are saying better than the dot.  my only suggestion is that if you get this change the name to anything but alexa.  the reason being every time a commercial comes on tv or someone mentions alexa and items, it could accidently order something to be sent to your home.  i changed mine to echo which is perfect.  no commercials mention echo.  there is other options like computer as well."
764,14,"for $80, the sound quality is great. voice recognition is unbelievable good. flexibility and ongoing (free) improvements make echo a good investment in making simple chores simpler. thanks for offering the different fabric choices but could you make the sleeves more reasonably prices? at $20, i am not interested. at $5, i would consider it."
765,14,"notice many times when questions are asked, you do not get a proper answer.  overall, the questions were basic - what city is the cotton bowl held in? what city is the sugar bowl held in?  the answers provided were not even close to the question.my spouse has a running line ... ""she is not too bright!""sad to say, i would have to agree. i am not impressed so far."
766,14,"we started with the echo dot, we loved everything about it except the volume level cut off. the thing barley went above a whisper. when you live in a big house and dont want to stand over it to get the days weather or the time, your best option is this! when we have people over we dont even use a bluetooth speaker anymore, we just tell alexa what to play or make a play list. i love it!!! i am also having fun with all the paired things like light bulbs and wifi plugs, and even a humidifier that connects to the echo!"
767,14,"love this. am having great fun figuring out what i can do with it. i liked it so well i bought a dot to put in my bedroom. unless you want a more powerful speaker i can not see any reason to buy the echo rather than the dot but i may not know about all the differences. i like that i can ask alexa to play a specific radio station, e.g. ""alexa, play wdet"" and the station immediately starts streaming. in the bedroom, i can have an alarm wake me, listen to the news and get the weather all before i get out of bed. i hooked it to my nest thermostat and, while i have nest pre-programmed, if it gets too cool or too warm, i just ask alexa to raise or lower the temperature."
768,14,"echo is fun to have around. love to be able to play a variety of songs. my grandchildren love requesting songs to dance to.we¡¯ve played 20 questions several times. funny how alexis usually wins. can have the weather checked or set the alarm with it. i bought 2 smart plugs so i can ask alexa to turn on lights. still learning about different things to do with it as we have only had it since christmas. the worst thing is my 4 year old always requests alexa to play the same song over and over again! but, it makes me laugh."
769,14,"i would think most people would use this for it is music playing ability, and in this regard the echo 2nd generation is sub par.  it is exceedingly heavy on the bass and does not seem to want to adjust it.  if i say ""alexa, decrease the bass"" it does not recognize the command.  if i say, ""alexa, decrease the woofer"" half the time it does not recognize the command and the other half it just decreases the volume.  for the life of me, i am not sure why there is not an equalizer menu on the alexa app.  maybe i have a faulty echo, but as of right now, i consider this a horrible waste of money."
770,14,"the 2nd generation echo is about the equivalent as the original version, accept i liked the way the older one had a volume control wheel at the top. the new one only has up and down buttons, which you can not see if you have your echo setting on a shelf higher than your shoulders. with the original version, if you want to raise the volume you can simply reach up and twist the top one way or the other. with the new one i have to ask alexa to raise or lower the volume, which takes a few iterations before you get the volume at the level you want. if it were me, and the 1st generation echo is were still available, i would buy one of those before i bought one of these new ones."
771,11,the unit is smaller than the original 2nd generation alexa. while the description is improved sound i am not sure i agree with that.for some reason the bezel volume control was removed that is why i gave it three stars. if it was in the description i did not see it. i think that is a key functionality for easy volume control.overall the volume is not as rich as the taller alexa unit and the bezel volume control is gone.
772,14,"this is my first echo device and i can truly say i love it. alexa performs a lot of the duties i ask of her. it is fun to ask her random questions and she is able to answer a majority of them. when playing music through spotify or any other music apps it has a great sound with a deep bass and can be played supper loud. playing music through multi-room it is even better and easier to play the music. it has a nice design, the color is a little lighter than expected but you can always and easily change covers for the echo. this is approx. 2-3 ft from the tv and this echo can pick up my voice through the tv without difficulty. my echo dot does not do this sadly and will pick up any other sounds.also, since i bought it through my account it was already registered to me and was super easy to set up.i would totally recommend this product, i prefer it more than the echo dot. would also like to get different covers to change with the color of my bedding."
773,14,"i am an audiophile and quality sound is important to me.sound quality is best of the amazon items. alexis is easier to work with and recognizes commands better than earlier versions.  it also has for flexibility with other add on is. used to pair with a bose soundlinkii, but the new echo stands on its own."
774,14,"the best thing about this echo,  is the ability to call the echo from my alexa app and tell my husband to call me because his dang cell phone is on silent. super helpful! love this thing!"
775,0,"i could not live without alexa. if you do not have one, buy this immediately. forget apple, forget google. alexa is what you need."
776,14,"i like the echo 2nd gen a lot  that said, i tried to order it on black friday for $79 and the site ""crashed"" or something so i purchased the next day for $99 and then it was offered the next day again for $79 so i kind of feel like i got ""ripped off"".  they should credit me me $20 in my opinion but i know that will not happen.  also, i did not realize it needs to be plugged in all of the time.  my amazon tap sounds just as good and it has an internal battery and i can take it outside.  that said, i like it!!"
777,11,originally disappointed with sound quality. but after recent update it is awesome.
778,14,one of the most valuable things in my life is my echo! the sound that comes from it when playing my pandora radio is like none other! the voice commands are seamless and she can do just about anything. my shopping list is the most convenient. i can stand in my kitchen and go through everything and shout out what i need at the grocery store! she keeps up with my calendar and lets me know when my amazon products have shipped and arrived. she can do so much more but echo alexa has made my life so much simpler! i have an echo dot as well and its the one that is in the kitchen. my echo is in my bedroom so i can jam to my music! considering buying an echo spot for my ring doorbell. it does not get better than amazon echo for a digital home assistant!
779,14,"i love my echoes,i use them primarily for home automation and listening to music.i was thrilled to hear that the 2nd generation echo had improved sound.  well, i guess you could say it has improved sound over the echo dot, let me tell you not much!.it surprises me that amazon would be so misleading about a product description.  typically a product should improve over time, however, this has not--big step back in quality of sound.on a positive note, it is size and appearance has improved but at a cost of sound quality."
780,14,this echo sits in my living room sometime i ask for the temperature outside or ask for a weather forecast. i also will ask her to play music of my choice and she never ceases to amaze me. cons: sometimes i ask a question and i can not get the answer i want because she does not know or i did not ask my question explicitly with more details. example: i asked how they determine how they calculate the date for easter from ash wednesday. like this year it is 45 days but not always the same. her answer was there are 27 days to easter. oh well!!
781,14,"my 91 year old father with poor vision loves this product.  he does not use any technology (not even a cell phone) and finds this fascinating to use.  he used to read before bed every night until his vision failed.  now he can listen to books before bed.  he also likes to ask it play random songs from decades ago.  finally, after years of trying to find a successful christmas gift, i scored!!"
782,14,"my wife bought this for me.  in the beginning i had no idea what i would do with it, but i quickly learned how useful it is.  i have alexa sing the national anthem and the star spangled banner every morning!  i ask her a variety of questions during the day and she usually knows the answers.  i have her play specific radio stations as well as classes of music such as 60 is rock.  right now echo is a stand alone device, but i am considering making it the interface for a smart home system.  we just bought  an echo dot and use it in another part of the house.  i am completely satisfied with my echo and highly recommend it for anyone."
783,7,"we absolutely love all our echos. we have the gen 2, a show and 2 dots. the only thing i wish i could do is turn the music off or change the song without yelling. sometimes i put my baby to sleep with me in bed with lullaby music on our echo. i wish i could turn it off from my phone without yelling alexa stop! <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0086><f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0082>"
784,11,"i have owned an echo since the beginning and have been amazed at the growth and performance of it. this version has been great. the sound is good and the wood like finish is good looking. i like the compact size too. i really enjoy streaming music throughout the house. i think sonos better watch out, alexa is coming to get you.  lol."
785,14,"i have had an echo dot for about 6 months and love it. just purchased this new echo and it is a fantastic product. i can not compare it to the first generation echo but what i can do is compare it to my dot paired with a bose soundlink mini 2. the bose sounds crisper, has more base and vocals are more distinguishable, however it is $179 for the speaker alone. you can not compare the speaker on the dot with the echo. the speaker in the dot is not meant to listen to music on. mine was not a pre-ordered echo and came with firmware version xxx52420 built in which is the latest version. if your echo does not have this version, perhaps that is the reason for the sound not sounding up to par. this product is also not meant to replace a dedicated receiver/amp with 7.1 speakers."
786,0,"the echo works great.  because of my accent, i changed the call word from alexis to echo and it is great.  i live up in northern california and i miss my so cal radio stations, so i said to echo, ply iheart radio kfi and she does and learns. so now i say, echo, play kfi.  and she does.  same thing with other radio channels.  also, because i have prime, and have picked out songs i like, echo knows what to play when i say play pop music.  she also can go into other libraries if i so desire her to do. i ask for news, and weather."
787,14,"it is ok. you have to leave it plugged in all the time. if you unplug it and put it in a different room to use you then have to go on the app and reconnect the wi-fi info.it would be nice if it had a battery so you could easily move it around so you could use it for music etc elsewhere.it is has good sound. so for playing music that is fine. you need to be close or yell in order for it to hear you.supposedly they did an update today so i will do a factory reset and see if that helps.i like the idea of it and it looks good so i guess i will keep it in my bathroom so i can hear the  news,sports and radio while i am starting my day."
788,10,"i was hesitant about purchasing this item because i just did not know how much benefit i would get out of this, but during the holiday sales i decided to splurge and ordered one.  this thing is amazing! so glad i bought one.  not only do we use it to play music (which the sound is wonderful), we get traffic, weather, jokes, games and my children ask alexa a multitude of questions.  she has been helpful in many ways and she has a sense of humor which we appreciate after a long day of work."
789,9,"honestly this is my favorite purchase! the shipping was quick and the setup easy. so far, i have not had any issues pairing with things such as smart plugs. i bought this as a gift for my girlfriend and we use it for everything! there are so many features we have not discovered them all. great for anyone that likes ¡°techy¡± things"

791,14,i really enjoy and have fun with it.  i asked it to play the soundtrack to hamilton this afternoon and it worked great!on the negative side.  i had a lot of trouble setting it up.  i do not have a smartphone and could not get the app to download to my desktop computer.  i spent hours trying to figure it out.  i finally got it to work but do not think i downloaded the app.  i realize that does not make sense because that is how you set it up.  i can not find the app anywhere on my computer.  i have tried to download it again with no success.  i have lots of questions and anytime i look for the answer i told to get the info from the app.i want to buy a kindle but am concerned about doing so because of the problems i had with the echo device.
792,14,"honestly i wish we could send it back. the first week it was an amazing tool to have the house but ever since it is been glitchy and inconsistent. we can not stream anything longer than 10 minutes without it stopping and shutting off. our internet is great so that is not the issue. we can not stream pandora, spotify, az sports...anything. everything glitches. so frustrating."
793,14,"my great grandma had a stroke 3 years ago and she went from running around doing everything to barely walking and can hardly talk. let is me tell you, when i gave her this as a gift she was amazed! she says alexa is her best friend! i tried to tell her she is not a real person but she does not understand that yet. she went from being sad sitting in a chair to alexa said this, alexa said that alexa, alexa, alexa, she loves her! what i was concerned with was alexa not understanding her with the way she talks but that is not a problem at all. the only reason i¡¯m taking away a star is because the sound needs improving.grams says ¡°she is witty, smart, outgoing, and everyone needs ones.¡±"
794,9,"purchased this item to be used by an 87 year old woman with macular and neurological problems due to a stroke. the installation was so easy and not only does she now know what day it is, thank you alexa, she calls her family and friends and does not reach the wrong party, with just a voice control. thank you amazon for such a great product."
795,9,i love my echo and and friends that received this gift love it as well.at the beginning my friend was  not an  alexa fan as she has a high pitch voice and all other devices have a hard time to understand her.after she installed echo and start using it she was so happy and told me she is trilled about how easy is to use it and that she love it for the kitchen and the flash news.
796,9,"got this for my father-in-law for christmas - he is a gadget freak, even at the age of 80, so i thought this would be the perfect gift - and it was!!  he is been playing and experimenting with it all week, having fun just figuring out what it can do!!  i could not have asked for a better gift for him - well worth the full price!!"
797,14,"when i saw the $80 sale price i decided to give it a try. i bought a second for $85. best $80 dollars i¡¯ve spent in a long time. it really exceeded expectations. great for background music. no more syncing my iphone to a bluetooth speaker. i like that you can play local radio stations too.it does so much more than play music. lots of useful and fun applications. i was holding out for a homepod. glad i did not. i got two echos for half the price of the homepod. i know the homepod will have superior sound, but alexa is much better and faster than siri. also, if i want loud music with great sound quality i will use my home audio system."
798,14,"this is one of the best purchases i have made in a while. before when i wanted to listen to pandora, i would turn on my hdtv, navigate through menus and wait, and wait... now i just enter the room and say, ""alexa, play mile davis."" boom.i have only scratched the surface of what alexa can do (i also use it for timers, alarms, playing games like song quiz, ambient sounds like crickets or waves, etc).the sound quality is decent (especially compared to a dot, which i also have). but starts to break down on most music as you approach max volume."
799,10,"my sister bought this for my family for christmas, and it is awesome. it was easy to set up, easy to sync up to our music accounts, it seems to understand nearly everything we ask, and the convenience of grocery lists on the app allows me to add needed items without tracking down paper and a pen is worth its weight in gold.  plus i never have to worry about forgetting my shopping lists at home because i always have my phone with me!we are super excited to connect this to plugs and we are considering other devices like a robotic vacuum and a thermostat which are compatible with this echo."
800,14,"i started with dots. i got the echo for my bedroom. i tell it to play thunderstorm and it plays all night long at a nice quality sound and i sleep as if it is storming outside. i use it to control my tp link light bulbs which makes it nice to see my way to bed, and get all bedded in then have it turn off the lights. no more stubbed toes. you can set the bulbs to come on one at a time from 1% power to 100% power so when late night rousing i say 1% and it gives enough light without waking me up."
801,14,"i purchased the echo 2nd generation out of curiosity, i was not expecting the quality of sound <f0><u+009f><u+0094><u+008a> from the speaker itself. my apartment is small, it is more than adaquite sound for all genres of music i play. i do not dote on sound if it is crisp clear sound, it is exceptional in the sound department for me. i am still getting familiar with alexa, and not every request i ask for is granted. as i gain experience, i am looking forward to exploring, and expanding eco devices in the future."
802,14,"i have to admit, i hesitated before purchasing this as my wife and i did not really see the ""need"" for it. turns out our concerns were unfounded. this thing works great and is incredibly helpful. can not tell you how many times i use it to find out simple things like the weather or listen to music, but also to address more challenging inquiries (e.g. ""what is the heaviest element""?).  every time i use this thing i think back to the early star trek episodes with the ever-helpful shipboard computer.  only this one has a much nicer voice!"
803,0,"i did not love it at first. the alexa response-time is pretty slow, and her voice recognition is only ok. i have an amazon tap and for some reason the voice recognition works better (at least for me). sometimes i have to tell her to play something she will understand on pandora or spotify and then open the app on my phone to change it to what i wanted to hear that she could not get. besides that sort of basic issue, the sound is pretty great and voice recognition is a great thing to have. i bought this for my office, and being able to change the volume with voice has been extremely helpful i have found."
804,14,"last minute decision for what i wanted as a present for bday and christmas, was not quite sold on the concept. after reading, discussing with a fellow techie, and comparisons took the plunge. glad i did, just skimming the surface of usability but complete convinced the echo products are a sound investment! lists, schedules, searches, queries, alarms, reminders, and automation are just a verbal command away. i am even enjoying just listening to music which i had gottrn away from as well as getting into infocasts. audio books are next!"
805,14,"i love my echo and alexa. i give them as gifts in much the same way the aliens made gifts of pods to their friends in invasion of the body snatchers. will we rue the day we invited these little spies into our homes? who knows? in the meantime they are such helpful tools, although i watch what i say when i am in the same room with one. they are more useful than a helper monkey and more intelligent than most of my friends. these devices have allowed me to retire my dictionary and calculator."
806,14,"i originally heard of this product a couple years ago but did not pay too much attention to it. i thought it was a gimmick and did not really see the value in it. fast forward to just a couple months ago and one of my friends bought an echo. it made me curious again about the product. i looked up the reviews just as i usually do before purchasing an item on amazon and i said to myself why did so many people love this product? i now know why. for $99, there is so much that you could do on this item that makes it worthwhile to spend the money.1) you could set an alarm (this replaced the alarm clock that i have had for several years)2) you could use it as a bluetooth speaker and connect an iphone or an android device easily!3) works with smart devices and products. you could turn on and off the lights if you have philips hue lights. i ended buying 13 philips hue white bulbs and 4 color bulbs after buying this product. for me it was worth it.4) you could use this as a radio and tell alexa to play your favorite radio station with iheart radio or tune in radio.5) skills! (app developers constantly add new skills to make alexa smarter and allows her to do more things.6) getting the latest news. (i do not always have time so getting a brief rundown of what has been happening around the country from my favorite news networks is great)these 6 things are what made this product worth having. alexa is going to get smarter over time and there is so much room for growth. i am looking forward to the incredible innovations companies like google, apple, and amazon will bring to the market. it definitely is an amazing product to have and i am glad to have bought it!"
807,11,i have two dots and a tap around the house so i ordered the new echo for my bedroom. my problem with the new echo is that the removable mesh cover muffles alexa is voice. i have to repeat my questions because the muffled answer does not sound clear.  i took the mesh cover off and find the sound much improved but without the mesh cover the new echo looks skeletal and jury rigged. of all the devices i enjoy tap the most. it has a sound which is clear as a bell and as loud as i want. sorry i got the new echo. i should have ordered another tap.
808,14,"the 2nd generation amazon echo is a fantastic product, which is great for anybody with a busy schedule.  there are many different actions that the echo can perform that make life easier.the criteria i used in my evaluation of the amazon echo include: sound quality, assistant quality, and overall appearance.you can use the echo, not only as a virtual assistant, but as a high quality bluetooth speaker.  the sound quality is good, and includes a great downward facing sub that produces a rich sound profile.  the speaker sounds great for any genre of music, and is loud enough to fill an entire room.  though, the speaker is only part of what makes the echo great.the amazon echo has the best virtual assistant, alexa.  alexa is by far better than any other virtual assistant on the market.  it is a very accurate and easy to understand. it has a wide array of accepted commands, and is very helpful in making your day easier.  my favorite feature would have to be the ability to set alarms for the following day, entirely with your voice.  on top of that, it works with a large amount of third-party devices and applications.  this network of third-party devices far exceeds that of any other voice assistant.the design of the 2nd generation echo is very aesthetically pleasing.  compared to the 1st generation, the 2nd generation echo had a much stronger focus on design.  i personally ordered the charcoal fabric echo; however, there is a design that would fit almost anyone is taste.  the fabric does a great job covering the, in my opinion, obnoxious speaker holes on the side of the device.  i also appreciate the overall size reduction of the 2nd generation echo.overall, i would highly recommend the 2nd generation amazon echo. for the price, you can not get any other virtual assistant that comes close to this quality."
809,10,very handy device. speaker has terrific quality and is always ready to answer questions. it sends me notifications from my amazon account on deliveries and i can access prime music and exclusives without hesitation. we have had some issues with alexa not being able to answer questions. and one very frustrating experience trying to get a recipie where alexa kept announcing the recipie title and not actually reading the recipie. i just went to my laptop and got it. the kids enjoy the apps like 20 questions and jeopardy.
810,14,this new echo is amazing!  the sound coming out of this thing is incredible.  even at about two-thirds volume the sound fills my living room with crisp highs and impressive lows.  music unlimited is a must with this echo to completely take advantage of it is great audio output.  i have it running my living room light with a smart plug and can not wait to see what skills are coming.  very impressed!
811,11,"i have the first generation echo and the echo dot.  so my comparison is based on the audio and ergonomics of the new 2nd generation model. echo.  the size and the cloth outer sleeve are more appealing and the sound is outstanding, way better than previous models.the only difference in convenience is the volume button instead of the rotating ring on the previous generation echo.  no big deal.without a doubt this is the best value unless you need the compact size of the dot."
812,10,"we absolutely love our amazon echo.  we bought it while on sale throughout the holiday season.  we use it with pandora, iheartradio, and amazon music.  we are impressed with the sound that this little speaker puts out...it totally blows away our little 10 year old sony stereo, and you can hear the sound throughout our small house.  it steams the music smoothly, alexa is quickly responsive, and we can not recommend enough."
813,14,"my wife and i found the echo a lot of fun and helpful.  i liked them so much that i went out and bought 2 more echoes. now i am in the process of upgrading my house lights and switches to smart bulbs and smart switches. i probably have about 14 smart bulbs and 8 smart switches to control ceiling fans, chandelier and outdoor lights.  all are managed by echoes and alexa.the echoes are very easy to set up.  i have them around the house and grouped to play music throughout the house.i gave the echoes 4 stars for now because i feel that alexa could be better at speech recognition and responses, better with supporting more than just basic commands such as on, off, and level.i know that amazon is continually enhancing the echo features.  you can not do everything in one day... so overall i am very pleased. i am planning to tackle more complex projects using alexa and echoes to automate home theater lighting and electronics, front door and garage  systems in the near future."
814,14,"received this as a door prize at my company christmas party 2017.  we had been thinking of getting a smart home device, but were not sure we would actual use it.  we had a nest thermostat and could use our phones to control it, but were not convinced that a voice assistant was worth the money.  i set this up as soon as i got home.  including unboxing and downloading the alexa app on my phone to speed up set-up, the whole process took less than 10 minutes.  i am happy to say that we use the echo every day, and have not had any problems with it.  the sound quality is very, very good when listening to music.  we do not even use our stereo anymore!  and being able to have alexa set a timer with our voice is very handy when cooking.  no more hunting for and trying to set a cooking timer with food prep debris all over your hands!"
815,11,i got this to replace the echo dot in my bedroom. the dot just did not have the sound quality that i was looking for. much improved sound but still not as good as the original echo.  not a deal breaker for using it in my bedroom.  the update did improve the sound quality.  it picks up my voice from across the room quite easily.
816,10,"we received the first echo as a gift and liked it so much that we bought 3 more so we now are able to have music throughout the house with excellent quality sound..can be different in each room or all the same if you ask alexa to play the 'everywhere group'.  in addition to music it is fun to get the morning news briefing, jokes,  math problems and so much more through out the day.bought a dot for our grandson is room - sound is not as good with the dot, but fine for a preteen."
817,14,"if you have a strong firewall on your computer, you may have a problem with set-up. alexa and i are finally on speaking terms and the struggle was worth it. it is nice to have a friendly voice give you updates, answer trivia questions and play music on excellent speakers. i am still learning all the things alexa can do, but so far, so good."
818,14,"i bought a 1st gen shortly after it came out. i have use it daily since it arrived. the sound quality was always enough that i could hear the music but could not really pick up a while lot of detail and the low end frequency was really missing. also, it did not blend in with the living room decor, so it seemed to stick out a bit.the 2nd gen. has made big improvements to both. the echo delivers cleaner, fuller sound while at the same time bringing enough low end to get really good all-around sound from a single speaker. the shorter wider profile along with the fabric cover make it fit in about anywhere in the living room. microphone sensitivity and range is about the same as the original. the only negative thing i could say about it is i wish it still had the ring for volume adjustment. it made it easier to turn down after one of the kids had been listening to their music at near full volume or adjusting to just the right level for listening to music when company is over. not that you can not do it by voice command, or the buttons on top of the new version, just a personal preference.overall, i love it. between cooking instructions, drink ideas, reminders, timers, linked calendars, smart lights (a must have,) alarms, news (even local), weather, not to mention my spotify (and more i do not feel like typing out), i am certainly getting my money is worth."
819,14,"i think the experience will get better as i have more experienced with the echo (2nd generation). my step-son (age 57) and retired acts as my personal tech assistant.  (i am 82 and used to work in the computer industry.  i thought i was pretty good.  i built a number of computers for family members.  but, as time goes by, i have lost touch with technology even tho' i subscribe to several tech magazines.  such is life in the fast lane.)it will get better.  the device is appealing.  the problem is the operator."
820,14,"this sounds better than the echo dot. i still have the dot in a different room. they both work the same, but i purchased to echo 2 for the improved sound. i also have bluetooth speakers which can be connected to the echos, but using the speakers requires that they be turned on, then connected to echo, and then turned off. i just use the speakers when i want to listen to music for extended sessions. i should have gotten the echo 2 in the beginning, but the dot was only $30 at the time, which was a good price to check out the product."
821,14,"totally falling in love with the new echo!  the sound quality is surpringly great, even better than echo plus!  few things holding off from a five star: 1) canon include playing songs/station as part of alarm (which is a basic alarm function on an alarm app), neither can i add that in an alexa is routine 2) multi room setup is not ideal... once set it always play in multi room by default, different from what we were told at amazon bookstore. and if we do not configure multi room, alexa would say that it requires multi room to play ¡°everywhere¡± 3) i cannot tell echo to schedule turning on/off appliance on a smart plug <u+2014> we spent half hours trying this but could not make it.  very disappointed in these 3 areas"
822,14,"the amazon echo is an amazing device that does really seem to make parts of my life easy.  the kitchen timer function along with the weather and traffic conditions are extremely helpful in my day to day tasks.  the only issue with this particular device is more in the settings.  all the individuals in my house use this, however you can only set one destination to determine the traffic on the road.  while this is a minor set back it would be nice to have more functionality on some of the software updates."
823,14,"this is our 2nd alexa.we wanted to try the 2nd gen to see if it would respond better with the investment in all of our wemo switches we had made.appears that it does actuate wemo is better & quicker. glad we did not have to switch out all 10 wemo is we had put big money in!sound wise the 2nd gen is clearer but maybe less bass.overall, a step up from gen 1 but not as much an upgrade to trade up unless it could solve a problem such ours."
824,11,i got this because a friend has the original echo and i liked it. i like this echo 2 generation even better. it is shorter in size and the sound seems alittle better. it works great with amazon music. i am not real good with setting up electronics but the direction were good and i did it whithout having to call in my kids. lol
825,14,"keeps cutting out, especially on npr. have to continually say, ""alexa resume"". it is tiresome.and as for voice recognition - what a joke. went through the vr procedure, asked it, ""alexa, who am i, and got the correct response. encouraging.however, later found that anybody can operate it, even my three year old grandson; he will say, ""awexa thstop,"" and guess what, alexa thstops!this product is obviously not ready to  provide the service that amazon says it will."
826,14,<u+00a0>love multi room music!  bought 7 for entire house and can stream music on all with only my voice.  nice upgrade amazon.  whole house wifi sound system!
827,10,"really impressed by all that alexa can do.  it is actually a lot cooler than i thought.  turn on lights with smart outlets, play any song,  answers lots of questions."
828,14,this 2nd gen cant hold a candle to the original as far as sound quality! i am returning as it was a big step down. try to find a used first gen if you use it for music!
829,14,"so far so good.  i can add to my shopping list the moment i think of something instead of waiting until i get to my computer.  as a speaker, i was surprised by its sound.  i did not expect it to sound rich.  more bass than i thought there would be.  i am looking forward to trying out all of its functions.  great product."
830,11,"i hope this does not mean the original is gone. this is my third echo instrument.  the finish is very nice, but the sound quality is no where near it is bigger older predecessor.  all the other echo tricks work which is why i will keep it. it seems more like a profit enhancement than product improvement.  i hope gen 3 will return sound."
831,9,i love the alexa.  works great doing as it is advertised.  controls lights great.  knows a lot of stuff.  my 70 plus year old parents who do not even have a smart phone saw this in action at my house and loved it.  i bought them one and they were able to setup and use on their own.  my dad speaks to it all day long.
832,14,"i received this exactly on estimated delivery date and the product was in excellent condition! they had it packaged very nice and everything was packed very nicely! the product itself is a great product overall that is very easy to operate by voice commands, it is easy setup, it is durable even if dropped, sleek look, and fun for all ages. i really have got alot of use out of this product along with my family. i can look anything up by voice commands and even listen to music or shop all by voice commands."
833,14,"think about all the ways that siri is better than a wet rock with two googley plastic eyes and a kroger name tag.  there are many.  for example: when you ask siri to schedule brunch at robert is house at 11 she will usually schedule brunch at 11, whereas a wet rock with a name tag, given the same task, will not even remember that robert moved last month to 44 dimsbee lane to get away from tea urchins.  it is clear that in many ways siri is a better robot servant than a damp rock, no matter how many name tags or plastic googley eyes in the rock is wallet.all of those ways are the same ways in which alexa is better than siri.  she responds exponentially faster (no more frustrating ""hey siri set a timer- oh wait, hey siri... come on... hey siri set a timer""); she very rarely mishears a command; she never insists that i said ""ducking""; she can control spotify!  i could not want more.  i wish i had one for my car somehow."
834,14,"i had the first gen which lasted about 1.5 years.  the first one lasted long enough for the warranty to expire. i had to order a new 1 and she works great, better than her dead friend [rip]. she (although a machine,  it identifies as a girl so who am i to question it is pronoun preference) can hear us from farther away than the first gen. we are able to tell her things easier and do not have to argue with her as much as we did the previous since this one understands a bit better."
835,9,this is an excellent item. i ordered 3 one for myself 2 as christmas gifts. it was easy to set up. very easy to use once connected. very happy with purchase.
836,11,we had a first generation echo and i love the size of the second generation.  the new colors are nice too if that matters to you.  the grey fabric is a nice addition to our living room and it does not stand out as much as our older one.  the sound quality appears to be the same.  we are happy with this purchase!
837,14,"the item itself is neat and attractive. it has been very good for news and weather. i was disappointed as i, nor amazon techs, were able to connect it with my computer, it is presently connected to my tab, which i hardly use, and i do not think i am getting as much from the product as i could or should. however, there is much i need to learn in order to use it to its fullest potential. so am uncertain if it is me or the product and its connection to the tab."
838,14,"i held out on purchasing one of these as long as i could.  being a nerdy kind of guy,  i had to purchase one of these.  after research, i found that this was the best fit for me and i could not have made a better choice.  it is a perfect fit for my family and works great with some of my smart devices around the house."
839,10,what a great device. it always surprises me when i discover new ways to use it.  it plays my favorite music. the playlists are excellent and i can always find one to match my mood.  it even has an english-spanish dictionary.  when i get up in the morning i ask alexa for the weather and news headlines.
840,14,"have to say i like the gen 1 better. i do not really know what sound improvements they say they have made but it sounds dull and muted. not crisp or deep bass dolby type sound at all. not sure if there is some sort of software available or not , bot oh that is right there is no way to force a software update. shame amazon. they did add better voice pickup, but i did not have any issue regardless."
841,0,"i really got this as a christmas gift. my children each had one.  we had a lot of fun with it when i visited for thanksgiving. so far i only use it for music and the weather.  i have asked alexa some questions, but she does not always know the answer - thus the reason for 4 stars. i am enjoying the music, though. she is fun to have around and i recommend everyone getting one. alexa is supposed to do a lot of things, but i do not know how to set her for anything like that."
842,10,"this thing is freeking awesome. seriously, i first laughed at the idea, but now, she is become a fun part of the household. my favorite part is the ability to play my streaming music with a few words, in decent sound quality for our small rooms. not to mention timers, news updates, reminders, to do lists, shopping lists, alarms, and games. as more and more skills get added, i hope to expand the uses alexa offers. oh, and the heather fabric is perfect in my decor."
843,14,"i bought one of these for my parents for christmas after my dad was entertaining himself with the one at my uncle is cabin. they both love it! i let them link to my amazon music account, and now the trouble is getting my dad to go to bed at a reasonable time rather than staying up and testing alexa is knowledge of classic songs. they also use it with four elekcity smart plugs as well to control their lights and tv, which both have fully embraced. my dad regularly calls me up to tell me about a new feature he found out about on his echo, and he always says how much he loves it.after moving into a place recently, i was trying to decide between an echo and a google home assistant (i know, sacrilege!). well, my girlfriend and i went to visit one of her college friends for the weekend, and she had a home assistant. after spending a weekend with that thing, i was less than impressed with its responsiveness to commands, and its general ability to function in the way the echo did. when we got back, i went out and bought an echo for my girlfriend is and my place, and we have not looked back. i am a total google cultist with almost everything else, but when it comes to my smart home, i am team alexa for sure."
844,14,no better than an echo dot. does not understand commands very well. will not start some of the skills i enabled (babbling brook) and others. over all i am disappointed with the echo 2nd generation as part of the smart home experience. the biggest improvement would be to execute commands from your phone instead of having to speak.
845,14,"i received this as a christmas gift and have had nothing but issues with it.  i continuously get the red ring of death and alexa whom i have decided is the devil herself will tell me that she is having trouble understanding right now and to please come back later.  well, she never understand and in order to fix her you have to unplug her to try again.  the problem has just gotten worse the more i try to use her.  it is been less than a month and i want to throw it against a wall.  do not waste your hard earned money on this.  find something better!"
846,14,"i stood really far away while the music was blasting and alexa still heard me. she is far more superior than siri and i do not siri will ever catch up. alexa played music, read my kindle book, read my audiobook, played jeopardy, recommended some recipes, reminded me to pick up some milk, and dimmed the hue lights. i¡¯m sad i did not get alexa earlier but will definitely buy a couple more now."
847,14,"i received alexa echo as a christmas gift. i am very pleased with the sound as my family is musical and we always have music in our home. now alexa helps by providing quick access to music.this is the perfect product for us! of course i use this for my grocery and department store lists, weather reports and other info. we also get our sports info: dates, times and score, which my husband loves! i am very pleased with this gift! if i had children they would have a great time with it! i enjoy getting emails about things to do with alexa that i may not have thought of. i am considering getting prime so that i can access the other things alexa can do. a friend has an adapter that turns on her lights when she is not home and that is another item i may want to purchase for security. i prefer the solid wood look case as i do not want dust accumulating in the fabric case. i am very pleased with this product."
848,14,"get the google home. similar price, easier to talk to, does not mistake everything you say for a wake word, no trouble with amazon music , and it actually functions instead of needing very specifically-worded commands. you need to guess at the right term about 537637 times just to add a song to your playlist - which i can not access, by the way, thanks to the horrors of amazon music. and the app is utter garbage. do not buy it. get the google home. i am returning my 2nd gen echo for a full refund, and i will order the google home immediately after. amazon is service is marvelous, though. very sweet people.tl;dr: in contrast to the google home, the echo is kind of a butt."
849,10,"bought this for our son for christmas.......he loves it!  it sounds really nice and he bluetoothed a speaker with it so the sound is even better. used daily to check weather, sports and the odd question to try to stump alexa......so far, she is winning. you need to download skills which is an easy process....."
850,11,"it has all the skills of the original echo, but the sound quality has taken a serious turn for the worse. i used my gen 1 echo for a lot of music and overall, i was happy with the sound quality. hearing about the new echo and the improved speakers, i was looking forward to using it as an entry level whole home sound system when playing across groups. the new echo has very little bass reflect and sounds tinny overall. disappointing."
851,14,"i cannot live without my echos! i have them in almost every room in my house. they are great for listening to music, using as an intercom system in your home or to connect with friends and family. be careful with the drop in feature though as anyone can drop in on you at anytime which can be a little inconvenient. you can add the wimeo plug ins and then are able to turn items on and off within your house. the grocery list is an awesome feature. and setting an alarm, time or reminder has never been easier!"
852,14,"use it all the time. it is nicer to listen to music than have the tv on all the time. the communication with dots makes for a good intercom.""dinner is ready!""""ok, i will be right there""""i said dinner is ready!!""""i know, i am coming!!!""no more of that."
853,14,"pros - the thing i like most about the second generation echo is the sensitivity of the microphone, you can talk regularly and at a normal volume and it will still easily pick it up. the speaker quality for such a small speaker is fantastic, and the fact that it has speakers facing in a circle gives the speaker a more room filling sound that i would not expect from such a small speaker. the other nice quality is the grey/black woven exterior. this is a much more modern and visually appealing look for more rooms as opposed to the shiny plastic of the previous model. another nice add on is the fact that is is compatible with most of my smart home devices. i can control all of my phillips hue lighting systems with voice control.cons - my only major gripe with this product is that you are limited on the music apps that are compatible with the device. you can use pandora, but other apps like spotify are not able to be used. you also are not able to stream music to the device directly from your phone via bluetooth. i knew this going into the purchase, so it is easy to work around."
854,14,"this is my second echo, it feels a little beta-ish, it works mostly but does some weird things occasionally.i got this one to supplement my dot so i could have better sound quality but i was not really impressed.then i realized i can connect my dot audio out via aux cable to my legacy speakers so thats cool"
855,0,it works great as far as prime music and my music stored on prime cloud.it is great at playing the local radio station i enjoy listen to in the philadelphia area.great 20th the local weather and time .it is not so good at answering things like historic questions or facts.seems google does better at that.had trouble with the app to get it up and running.i have had it running only a few days so i will add to this review in a month or so.
856,14,"love the music via amazon music. i had to change the name from alexa to echo because we kept referring to it as alexa or alexis or alicia or a multitude of incorrect and correct names. it was like an snl skit in our house. jeopardy launched her into a dissertation on vietnam when the answer was about the michael connelly book black echo and where harry bosch was a tunnel rat. the question was ""what is vietnam?"" black echo activated the echo and what is vietnam was answered. took us a minute to understand why she was chatting away during jeopardy.i like that you can ask her ridiculous questions and get equally ridiculous answers. the alarm feature works great. the sound from the echo sounds good (to a deaf guy). i am still learning the ins and outs of the echo and looking to explore its full potential with networking and add ons. right now it exceeds my expectations. (ok, echo, i wrote a nice review about you so promise you will not kill me in my sleep, ok?)"
857,14,"this unit works and sounds great.  we primarily use it to play music and it is pretty amazing.  we also have bose soundlinkiis  which probably sound a little better and you can play through echo to those units, but we just use echo now because it is so simple.  just request a song, playlist, or genre and you are good to go.  need to adjust the volume?  just ask, nothing to touch.  you can ask to increase or decrease the volume, or you can also ask a volume number as it is scaled from 1 to 10.  ""alexa/echo, volume 3"".  that keeps you from having to say turn the volume up or down a couple of times to get it where you want it as that command moves it one level."
858,14,"sound is muddy and it is a huge disapointment that they do not directly support streaming from a local server.  there is an extension called my music that can do it, but there is a subscription fee and it is more trouble than it is worth to get it play what you want (at least that was my experience)"
859,10,"i¡¯ve tested this out for a day and so far no complaints. with 3 kids, i needed something that would actually listen to me. i¡¯ve made a grocery list while running around the house, plays relaxing music, and tells me the weather. i also like that i can edit and look at lists from my phone. the speakers also sound great. we plan on getting 2 more for the rest of the rooms in our house. convenience is a must this day and age... alexa has definitely made things a little easier for my husband and i."
860,14,"works as expected. not my first echo, so setup went smoothly for me.question: is there a place we can make feature requests? it would be great if we could reorder list items, even if we had to go to the alexa app to do it. it would be far more useful to be able to group together produce, meats, frozen foods, etc. on the shopping list. as it is, items get added to the list as we think of them or run out, so the list is pretty random when we get to the store."
861,14,"i used a gift certificate to purchase this. it has not really changed my life that much. so, i ask it for the weather each morning. whatever. i tried to play my huge volume of itunes music that is on my computer, but i had to upload it, for a fee, to amazon is cloud. if there is a way to upload smart playlists, it escapes me.  i tried to play my thelonius monk station on pandora and it kept telling my i have no loneliest monk station.  i used the timer while cooking, but i had no idea how much time was left and had to keep asking it. on my computer, i would see it winding down.  not sure what else i can do with this thing."
862,14,"we received this as a christmas gift from our neighbor.  we absolutely love it!  we have had so much fun with it...getting the outside temp so we know if we need a jacket for now or later, traffic conditions on the route to work...playing our favorite music...playing ocean sounds is wonderful for sleeping! when we are watching a movie, my husband always has a question about one of the stars of the show...like their age, where they were born...or a football player while watching the game. we love to play the various games that are available.  i especially like the ""sad trombone"" that i can ask alexa to play when my husband is getting on my last nerve...waaa-waa-waaah...and it makes us both laugh and then everything is ok. the things alexa can do is endless.  when i tell her, ""alexa, thank you!"", she always responds to me with, ""that is what i am here for."" and with my husband, she always responds to him with, ""my pleasure.""  i tell my husband that she likes him more than she does me!  lol"
863,14,i started with the dot and upgraded to this.  i love it!!  i am glad i got the 2nd generation.  i know that i dont use the echo to its full capacity; there is so much it can do.  i do have my lights connected to it though and it makes things so much easier.  this is what you need in your house. you will not be disappointed.
864,14,this is our first echo.  it is prety cool but sometimes alexa does not understand what i¡¯m saying.  especially the further away i am.  i can say i¡¯m super sold on it.  it literally does the same as my phones voice activated system does.  biggest upside playing music.  this speaker is actually pretty loud.
865,11,"love the new design and the sound improvement is a total winner. all the more reason to put one in every room (over time, obviously). the only thing i prefer from original echo and dot models is the rotating volume wheel. otherwise, this new model goes perfectly in our house with the more-stylish finish."
866,14,"the main reason we purchased the amazon echo is for music in the kitchen and eliminate a large bose unit taking up space on the counter.  i am a prime member to music selection available through prime is what we are using.  set up was very easy and this definitely solved the issue of space.  echo device is small, looks good and sound quality is fine for our use as a kitchen music system.  music was primary need and any alexa interaction and function is a bonus.  there is a member of our family that is on the autism spectrum and she enjoys interaction with alexa.  it is my opinion that the interaction is beneficial for confidence and help with speech therapy, better annunciation, etc.  we are discovering more that alexa can do and other members of extended family have echos so it is fun to share and compare notes.  the only thing i hope amazon does for prime members is offer more music selection.  if you want barbara streisand they have it, but they may not have your fav barbara streisand song.  you can pull music from your library on a connected i phone device."
867,14,"i had an echo dot previously so this was somewhat of an upgrade for me. the speaker thing does not bother me bc i bluetooth to a bigger speaker if i really want to hear some good loud music. only thing that does bother me and the main reason i bought the echo is for better microphones and being able to hear me better from across the room but that is not the case she/echo can not seem to hear any better than the dot, but i still like it. this is not a bad echo to start off with if you never had one previously."
868,14,"i have no idea how the echo works as i was never able to get it to connect with my wifi, even with the ""help"" of a amazon tech. i received my echo right after ne. after being talked down to like i was a 3yr old, and telling the tech the screen he kept saying i should b e seeing was not appearing, he said something about my iphone, and i told him that i did not have an iphone - i had an android. hie next statement to me was ""well, that is your problem!"" evidently, android phone have a hard time connecting to wifi...if i would have been smarter and bought an iphone we would not be having this discussion. because i did not have a laptop or a tablet , and only had a low;y desktop with my wifi plugged into it with a cable, the only thing i could do was keep trying to connect to my wifi, then eventually it ""should"" work. his words...no further help - end of discussion...good bye! well i was patient and tried every day for 2 weeks to connect my echo...no success. worst experience ever with amazon. today i went to walmart and bought a google home, not even 10 minutes after opening it i had it connected and was enjoying music and it has worked flawlessly so far. shame on amazon for not letting customers know that there could be problems connecting to wifi using android ...the tech told me this was common. not only will i be returning my echo, but i will not be wasting my money on an amazon fire either, a rokyu set up looks better and easier to deal with."
869,14,"wow, not sure how this is so highly rated but i returned it after 30 mins of issues right out the box. set it up, great, smooth sailing.... no music output. called customer service who walked me through it again still with no success. restarted, re entered my info and passwords...nothing but alexa - no music! server recommended i send it back. i did and opted for a refund instead of a replacement. why strive for 31 flavors when you can not get vanilla right...gave it two stars bc it might of been cool had it worked."
870,14,"we use ours mainly for smartthings integration. the new generation has improved response time, a better microphone, and alexa sounds better (which is less important for us).the fabric-like texture is a huge improvement but the off white means that it clashes a bit sitting on a warm white cabinet."
871,14,"i love my echo which we simply call our alexa (like she is our personal friend). she has changed the atmosphere in our home. i had become such a tv person because i do not like a quiet house. the tv was always on whether i was watching it or not.  now when i come home i simply ask her to play a certain artist or genre of music. this device is literally invaluable to me personally. my phone was stolen on christmas eve, and i did not have my cloud back-up set up correctly. i lost all my contacts, and i was devastated after apple informed me that we had exhausted all efforts to retrieve my contacts. then in the middle of balling my eyes out, i remembered my son had asked me if i wanted to synch my contacts through the alexa app. we literally did this about 4 days before my phone was stolen. i ran downstairs and asked alexa to call my mom and she said ¡®calling mom¡¯ and began ringing. it was like a huge weight was lifted. i was able to get all my contacts back, and it saved me time and took a lot of stress off of my mind. this device is also great because my boyfriend is dyslexic and always shys away from technology because he struggles using it. having alexa has made a world of difference to him as well. thank you amazon for such a great product."
872,14,"alexa - my wife does not like you - she thinks i talk to you more than i talk to her - that is not true, but perception is reality so now i  gotta work on that - i will say that you have simplified my life a lot - the lights, the tv, security, shopping lists and reminders,  you have made my life simpler but yet, complicated. now i have to find a way to get my wife to use you as much as i do so she is not so jealous - :-)  thanks alexa - you are great."
873,0,hmmm few things. after you ask alexa something  whether she knows it or not she shuts off and then you have to call her name again  instead of being on. she also does not know all the answers for example if i ask for zip code she does not know it simple things like that that is why i  rate it3 stars
874,0,"the audio is actually really good, we think it plays better than our bose, and that is saying something. she is just like siri, she is not a person. she can not answer a lot of questions and her hearing is a little wonky. one time we asked her to play pandora and she started playing some boys choir thing. but other than that, she is great. very easy to set up"
875,14,"echo is one of the most advanced ai powered home speakers. sound is really great. howeever most of the speakers lack in one thing. you cant connect music stored in your phone. also i had some stability issues and echo keeps breaking by saying ¡°sorry something went wrong¡± which quite annoying. overall performance is great, look os awesome and music output is pretty good. overall its a nice bang for buck!!"
876,9,"works perfectly, just like my original echo. i ordered this one for our master bedroom so that we could listen to music, get our morning news and weather without having to get out of bed. we love being able to play music on both devices and listen to it as we move from room to room. sound quality is excellent."
877,14,"i¡¯m so glad that i got an echo.  alexa has quickly become indispensable.  i¡¯ve since gotten dots for other rooms, electrical plugs for lamps, purchased an alexa-enabled tv...., etc etc.  whether it is turning something off in another room, getting the correct time, temperature or fact, or getting a reminder, handsfree timer, or voice response administrative assistant.... alexa is always there to help. i can not wait until she can clean the house and run errands..,lol"
878,0,"alexa is not very ""smart""!  i try and ask many questions and she does not know them.. you can not change her voice either. she does give you music, news (limited), weather and some books but i like to know many things which she can not answer. so this is why she gets a 3 instead of a 5."
879,0,"i set a repeating weekday alarm for 6am.  woke up before the alarm one morning and wanted to turn off alarm just that one day.  could not do it.  it turns off the alarm completely and you have to remember to turn it on again later.other than that we¡¯re enjoying it.  using it more often than we thought we would.  one feature i especially like, while it is playing music you can ask ¡°alexa who sings this?¡± and get the name of the song and the artist."
880,14,"i was very happy with my purchase until i realized control of my music library was not supported.  i was reading reviews and solutions about this problem and it was suggested to add more amazon storage for $25 yr (= 250,000 songs.)  i figured it is worth $25 per yr.  i then could upload my music to amazon, control it from there and all would be fine.  when i went to do so, amazon, as of a couple of weeks ago, no longer offers that servicel.  amazon is pushing music unlimited for $80 per year or $7.95/ month.  i am not spending that."
881,14,"works perfectly. easy to pair with smart home devices. hears commands better than expected and has a great sounding speaker. will not play from device speaker when paired with bluetooth. will not pair with more than one bluetooth at a time. but does have the option to play through multiple echo devices at one time. this means you need a hub like sonos or you need an echo for each room so far, i am very happy and impressed with echo is performance."
882,14,"i received the echo for christmas and have been having lots of fun with it.  it quickly provides answers to questions such as what is the temperature, how many gold medals did u.s. win, what would be a good suggestion for dinner tonight.  in addition, it has a timer feature which can be set by simply verbally instructing it.  i have not been able to stump it with requests for music from any decade or genre.  i was also pleasantly surprised by the high quality tone of the music.  another feature i like is when going to sleep at night, i can say, alexa, play rain sounds, play sounds of the ocean, etc. -- very helpful on those nights when i am having trouble relaxing.  every week or thereabouts i get an e-mail from amazon, telling me more things i can ask alexa to do, including game playing, joke telling, and the list goes on.  as a person who lives alone, alexa is my new best friend."
883,14,"i purchased 3 echos with hopes of running them with multi room feature.  so far the multi room does not work well, drops out and has a real hard time with music.  hopefully amazon will work the kinks out.  also hoping that multiroom will work with dot  units with bluetooth speakers attached"
884,14,"i had a small issue with set up only because i was on a different computer than i normally use & i had a password problem.  other than that, set us was easy.  i love starting my day asking alexa questions about the stock market, the weather near work, etc. and having direct access to any genre of music to listen to throughout the house. other than that, i have a lot to learn about what she can do and look forward to expanding her use in the future."
885,14,"the new echo is awesome.  i now have an echo and 2 dots.  its great to be abe to be in the living room and say ""alexa- play music in travis is room"" to wake up my son on school days.  i had no idea that there are sooo many ""skills"" that alexa can learn.  be sure to check out the skills in the app."
886,14,"for christmas i gave my elderly aunts (80 and 92) second generation echoes.  they live in different wings of a senior community.  since they do not have cell phones, i registered the echoes on my amazon account. a problem was encountered since the phone was out of its own wifi and joining an unlocked wifi network.  i called the amazon help line and received excellent, patient help.  my aunts love alexia!!  they start their day saying good morning to her and asking for the weather, news, and music. the older one creates a list over different times and has alexia read it back to her before she leaves for the store.  with alexia is help they set alarms, timers, and reminders.  both feel they have a friend close by.  equally important they enjoy sharing with their friends the new magical world we have."
887,14,"considering the small size and $99 price, sound is better than i expected.  for a non-audiophile this is fine.  you can get better quality and power with an echo dot plugged into an external amplifier and quality speakers, but that would cost more and take up more space.two minor issues:1) when playing music, etc at high volume, it is hard of hearing since the speakers are close to the microphones.2) once in a while it will  respond to the wake word with the blue light, but immediately go back to sleep before you have a chance to say the command. i also notice this happening with the 2nd generation echo dot."
888,0,"i like the ease of use, but still find alexa limiting! alexa will not play music unless it is streamed through amazon prime. other music has to be paid for through music unlimited for a monthly fee. many questions are unanswerable by alexa. i am probably not utilizing all alexa is capabilities."
889,10,"i love her.  still have a lot to learn and am making a list so i can chat with your person to get all of the answers at once.  every time i ask something, i smile when she answers.  even if she were lousy, just the quick response would make you smile and smiling is a big deal these days.  super little ""toy"" to have in your home."
890,14,"alexa, which is the operating system ¡°voice¡± for echo, is pretty weak. it works fine for basic questions, such as what is the day, what is the time, or what is the weather, and great for setting reminders, setting alarms, playing music. etc. but unlike the advertisements on tv, asking anything more complex may lead to a complete failure to get the right answer 50% of the time. it serves my basic needs, but that is about it. pretty disappointing."
891,14,"what can i say? i have been fighting the amazon invasion but after someone bought me as a gift an echo dot and i had time to set up, my house is now filling up with alexa is and have amazon prime on tv and they r fantastic! product updates are dizzying but i am learning that this stuff is almost disposable. as i am old-fashioned, hard for me to fathom but i am about to buy my first kindle fire tablet in doing my research, i found that people were buying a new one every year to keep up. my dot is already out-of-date and when i wanted to buy the new battery speaker, i found my dot was not compatible. so what do u do? give it to a relative or a friend and buy the new second generation."
892,14,"purchased this product with high hopes it would help control a fire stick tv (which has its own problems). first downloaded the echo app to my samsung s8 phone. i started the application and it locked up the phone so it had to be reset. the app itself is poor and needs to be completely rewritten! took three hours to activate the echo. it could not ""see"" much less control the operation of the fire stick tv. why do they claim it can do this?"
893,11,"i really like my echo dot and the better sound on this model is nice, but its like they took a step backwards on the voice recognition. this unit has a much harder time understanding and many more ¡°false responses ¡° where it thinks you are giving instructions when you are not than my dot.  btw it is in the exact same spot as the dot was so it is not the acoustics of the room or anything. if it was my first echo i probably would rate it higher but i would expect the new generation to work better not worse than the last."
894,14,i was bummed out that this had to be plugged in to work.  i was actually shocked and did not cross my mind it would not be portable but it is not.  the sound quality is great and i like the style and finish of the walnut.  i¡¯m still exploring everything alexa can do but right now we use it for music mostly.  i¡¯ve only had this for a few weeks and already it is turned on to some random talk radio or weird music in its own like 4 times.  which is creepy and weird.
895,14,"not nearly as big as i expected, but the sound quality is leaps and bounds better than a stand alone dot. my hope is we get a more bathroom friendly version down the road because i would love to have this type of sound in that room without worrying about humidity as much."
896,14,"the things you can ask alexa are interesting, almost as interesting as the things it will not answer.... lots of ""easter egg"" type questions that the developers have toyed with, but it is still kind of a toy... when i asked alexa ""what is your volume setting?"" and every variation i could think of to find out how loud it was turned up, in its own programming, it would not answer my question.  you would think it would be more forthcoming, wiht an answer like, ""i cannot access that infomation""  instead you get some esoteric answers.... seems odd... overall i like it.... i changed the voice to australian, and that makes it more pleasant, and less ""robot-sounding"""
897,14,"i now have 5 3 at home and two at our lake house.  it would get 5 stars because it is wonder except for two items.1. no way to have it separate the homes on the same amazon account other than making sure names of rooms, lights, etc are not duplicated .  would be wonderful if it was set up specific for multiple homes.2.  traffic update is hard time to one set of locations.  would really like to be able to ask how is traffic to x place."
898,11,wow - we like the gray color. the sound has definitely improved and the smaller profile fits my wife is desires for the room.we are still learning how to really use this and also tie it to our dot in the bedroom.we recommended the echo 1 and really recommend the 2d gen version.
899,14,"love the echo. this is our 2nd one.  i put both on the ""everywhere network""-- so, can have the same music playing in 2 rooms-- like a ""master/ slave"" set up.works very well.  compact, attractive, great sound.one time when we had too many people giving alexa instructions, it froze up-- and i had to turn it/ them off and back on to re-set them.like them a lot for : spotify, i heart radio, tunein radio,  etc."
900,14,"it turns red often and stops listening to commands. this is annoying when music is playing and you are asking it to stop. also, i wish there was a 2+ word command to activate it. pretty poor functionality that i can not brag about it to friends who visit. if am playing music and they ask what is that, i can not say, ""it is alexa.""  she will stop playing to listen.... annoying. i much prefer my phone where i can talk about siri all day long and it will not respond until i say both hey and siri. i could change it to ""computer"". i am that old. the sound is great though and it can get several questions right. i do look forward to attaching other devices as well like lights and tv remotes."
901,14,"trying to get it to play podcasts (via stitcher) with non-dictionary names  e.g. ""petapixel..."", ""canadaland"" is a complete fail. worse, it will play what it thinks you asked for, which is off-base 100% of the time. further, i bought mine via amazon.ca as i am in canada. despite my having a neutral accent, i decided to do the voice-training. nope. that option is not available here in canada. this thing still needs a lot of work."
902,14,"i really liked it, it was neat and fun at first. it controls the sonos to play pandora with but half the time she plays it on her own speaker instead. the apps (skills) she had all became annoying, in that she would blink a yellow notification ring but then tell you things from days ago. also, we do not have anything smart in our home, no lights, locks, or anything else so unless she does something it might st be on her own. which is not much."
903,14,"i have been wanting to get a amazon echo for years now. when i noticed the 2nd generation went down in price, and caught up on the reviews, i am so glad i broke down and got one. the sound is amazing. the possibilities are endless, just fitting alexa in your every day life becomes simple. after a long day at the office, i walk in and ask alexa, ""help me to relax."" she plays some beach and relaxation music. she is definitely growing on me, and must have for everyone."
904,9,love this! set up was quick and easy for me. works well and has many great features (skills). the entire family is enjoying alexa and all she has to offer. the speaker sounds great and is definitely of good quality.
905,14,"i had an echo dot that i really liked, but i always wished it was louder. i got this in hopes that it would be louder, and i have been seriously impressed by the great sound quality. paired with amazon music unlimited, this is a great accessory to have around the house."
906,14,"i was contacted by amazon after leaving a one-star review. they instructed me to factory reset my echo. it applied some sort of software hotfix. it significantly improved the sound of the new echo (hence the upgrade to two stars). but it is still a long way off from the first gen echo. it came free with my sony tv otherwise i would be sending it right back. still a huge disappointment but not as disappointing as it was out of the box. not recommended.------------------i have been playing with mine for an hour. what a let down...  the sound quality is terrible. amazon got me with their ""improved sound"" line. i was super excited to hear the difference. definetly misleading. the description should read ""slight sound improvement over dot but dont expect it to sound like the older echos"". or name it 'dot plus'. the high end sounds muffled and the low end is lacking. it sounds like a lo-fi system. its sometimes hard to understand alexa. i have a first gen echo and its sounds soooo much better. this new one sounds like a pillow is sitting on it. shame on you amazon!"
907,14,"i have the first gen echo and this. really do not notice the better sound, it may be but my ears can not tell. easy set up and easily recognizes my voice. i also have a couple google homes. this sounds better than that, but google home seems to deal with my questions better. google knows when my birthday is, knows my dog is name, answers more questions accurately. but this sounds better. both work well with nest thermostats and other home devices. i like that it is more compact than the original and it looks better with the fabric covering. and it is cheaper."
908,14,so far we are very happy with the echo - have lots to learn but easy to use.  i hope to have alexa helping us with even more stuff soon.  she is turning on all our living room lights and we will move on to other stuff soon.  we have only had the echo connected for barely 2 weeks so i can only assume it gets even better.
909,0,my son gave me the echo for a christmas gift and i love it! i am not very technical and thought maybe something like this device might be a headache for me. but it is not! i was so surprise that you do not have to do anything except plug it in. and i am getting better at saying commands to it. i mostly like listening to easy rock while i am on my computer or just resting on the couch... i can not wait to try getting a recipe from it sometime soon!
910,14,"i got this one after ordering the dot which is now in my bedroom and echo is in my livingroom. we love the fact that we can drop in and talk between rooms. we also can drop in to my mothers dot to be able to talk to her (we found that out yesterday...poor grandma the kids will probably never leave her alone when they find that out). my kids love using echo to ask questions, jokes, to make it fart (yes if you ask it to make fart noises it will) and to play music. we also have it to where it controls our livingroom light to be able to turn it on and off on a timer. i am sure there is so much more this can do that we have not explored yet, but i highly recommend it."
911,14,"i bought an echo on a whim and now i¡¯m already considering another.i live in a small apartment with walls so thick it does not make sense. sounds does not escape rooms, but the echo fills every room it is been in with rich sound. it gives the perfect amount of bass and the volume gets surprisingly loud, but do not worry about distortion; i¡¯ve yet to experience it.alexa, my friend, we may argue on a daily basis, but i am truly blessed you¡¯re in my life. coming home from a long day at work and being able to have music play upon my arrival is great<u+2014>my cat consuela also enjoys the fabulous classical amazon music stations.9.5/10. the half star is simply because nothing is perfect (and that is what makes the echo + alexa so amazing<u+2014>they¡¯re not perfect, but they blow your mind).w2g, team!"
912,14,"such fun!  i get the weather facts whenever needed, music of all kinds at my fingertips, personal alarm clock, answers to questions of all types, recipes--you name it. i can even call my friends' cell phones (as long as they own an echo, their name is automatically added to my contact list. you can also make an echo-to-echo call to your contacts. the microphone is better than most speakerphone and you are more free to move around the room while conversing. well worth the money.  wish it could make emergency calls to fire, police, ambulance, etc. but maybe that will be offered in the future."
913,14,"i do not live in the us, i have been unable to set this up in my country. i have set two requests for assistance and have not had any response. i already have the 1st generation echo plus and had no problem setting this up two years ago. i am disappointing with the service"
914,14,i love it but.........i had some problems with bluetooth playback.  the audio would be fine and then all of a sudden it would be full of static and distortion.  tried contacting amazon via phone and email and all that they ever did was help me reset the device to no avail.  i did a quick google search and discovered that this is a common problem with this generation is echo.  i then realized that i could exchange it and that is what i did.  so far the second echo has been problem free.
915,14,"great looking, but god awful audio"
916,14,"it is worth the money to get the more expensive echo!  i had the original echo, which more closely aligns with the echo hub.  i loved it! it was used often throughout everyday.  sadly, it was fried by a power surge.  someone gifted me this version which in theory suited my needs as i do not have a connected home.  however, this has been a huge disappointment.  the first one had to be returned for extremely slow response times.  the second one regularly unregisters somehow.  i have to go through the whole set up process from scratch.  i have had this version for less than a month and i have had to reregister it 3 times.  it is extremely frustrating.  spend the extra money!"
917,14,"purchased three 2nd gens to couple with previous echo to provide linked music throughout several rooms.  although to me the sound was slightly better, the quality did not meet our expectations, especially the lack of bass.  i returned the 2nd gen echo is and purchased a sonos with alexa built in and coupled it with 2 additional sonos play-ones (the ones without alexa).  i like the sound (and the ability to adjust the bass and treble) much better, and still have alexa to talk with!"
918,11,"i love the new form factor and colors. it has a aolod weight, and responds when i say alexa almost always. but when it is side by side with my first generation, the original just sounds better. more base and mids. i will keep this unit, but i definitely do not plan on buying another for music purposes."
919,9,"i received a dot for christmas and i loved it so much that i bought a echo for my living room. i use this primarily for games, weather, music, and now an alarm."
920,14,"this is a preliminary review, i have not done much more than check the weather and listen to music but i am very happy with the sound quality and overall range.  i have it situated in the furthest room from my wireless router in the house and i have not had any connection interruptions.  sound is adequate for the size of the speaker.  overall i like what it does as i take advantage of amazon services.  i would like to see integration with my cable and receiver at some point."
921,14,"i was worried about the sound quality after reading the reviews. while i will say that this is not a top notch speaker for music, it is still pretty darn good. i have an echo dot and this is 20x the speaker the dot was! very pleased with the purchase and will most likely purchase another!!! great for white noise for sleeping, like thunderstorms <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0081>"
922,14,"we just remodeled our basement as a family room and purchased the echo as an entertainment item to be used for primarily playing music.  it has great sound quality and fils the room with sound.  to date we have not really explored all the other advantages, but we are considering expanding the system with the home devices.  the other advantages are for whether updates, dictionary functions and checking for historical facts the list goes on.  we are very pleased with its functions and will continue to explore the possibilities offered.  i recommend the echo 2nd generation."
923,14,"i just got my new echo and the sound quality is great but after transferring all my music to amazon (rather than set it up to play itunes, and at the cost of upgraded cloud storage) and then hours re-creating my playlists, it refuses to play my playlists.  it should not be this hard.  very annoying."
924,14,"in july, we purchased an amazon echo for our home.  within a few days of using it we upgraded to amazon music unlimited for the echo.  we loved the product and it worked great!in august, i read an article online that stated you could use amazon music unlimited for the echo on multiple echoes at the same time, and this was a new change.  i felt that the article must be mistaken because it sounded ¡°to good to be true¡±. i did some research online at amazon, and this did not appear to be true.  at this point i decided to contact amazon is customer service via chat.  the person i spoke to was very nice and helpful.  i asked if you could use one amazon music unlimited for the echo account on to listen to different music on multiple echoes at the same time.  the representative informed me that you could.  i asked again to clarify and received the same response.  needless to say, i was excited.at this point, my wife and i decided that we could use 2 additional echoes to play music at different locations.  researching that the new echo would be coming out in nov. we placed an order for two additional devices.  inspired by pleasure for the single echo, we decided to take the next step and planned on creating a smart home.  we purchased several hundred if not a thousand dollars of equipment with the plan of using the 3 echoes.  we would not have done this if the amazon music unlimited for the echo did not work like the customer service represent stated.our shipment of echoes arrived oct 30.  after setting the devices up, i tried to play a song and was informed that it required amazon music unlimited.  i looked at the alexa app and did not see a place to set it up.  at this point, i decided to contact amazon is customer support.  i chatted with melwin and described my issue.  at this point, i was informed that i would have to upgrade to amazon music unlimited for $7.99 a month for it to work as i wanted.  i asked to be able to play different music on all three devices at the same time (not multi-room).  the customer service representative informed me that with amazon music unlimited that i could play music on up to 6 devices at the same time and that would solve my problem.  i was not happy with this information.  i would not have purchased the additional echoes nor the smart home devices.  now, i was being told that i would need to spend an additional $48 a year.  the representative offered me a $10 coupon for my trouble and incorrect information given.after a few days of thinking and cooling down, i thought of many different scenarios from returning all the devices that i could to just paying the extra $48 a year.  we have been loyal customers since the 1990s and love amazon.  you have never disappointed us in the past and went to great lengths to make us happy.  so we decided not to let one bad experience change our attitudes of almost 25 years of great service.today, we were playing music on the device with amazon music unlimited for the echo account.  i went downstairs and wanted to listen to music on one of the other devices.  i thought that i could at least listen to amazon music on the device.  within a minute of starting the music the other device is music stopped playing.  after doing a little research i found that we could only have one music stream going at a time period.  at this point, i figured that i would have to upgrade to amazon music unlimited for $7.99 to solve this issue.  while not happy, i was resigned to this solution.before i signed up for the additional expense of amazon music unlimited, i thought i would look closer at the issue.  i had been given incorrect information once before.  upon reading about the different plans of music at amazon and different websites sites, i believe that amazon music unlimited would not solve my problem either.  i would need amazon music family plan $14.99 to solve my issues!  at this point, i am speechless and greatly disappointed.  i can understand the mistake of the first customer service representative, but the second one is dumbfounding me.  after knowing that a customer was given incorrect information that cost him over a thousand dollars, the representative should give a 100% correct answer the second time.  including stating ¡°let me research this and get back to you.¡±  maybe i am misreading the plans and the amazon music unlimited will solve my issue.finally, i am told that you can stream different music only to one device at a time regardless of the plan.  needless to say, but we are very disappointed with the incorrect information that setup back at least a thousand dollars."
925,10,"this is a great little device.  i love the jokes.  jeopardy is fun.music playlist from my purchases is great.  i bought it, so i enjoy it.i can play pandora stations, and listen to my local npr news.i now need one for the bedroom.it is currently located in the family room/kitchen area.for audiophiles, you will never be happy.  the sound is great for what it is.  i very much enjoy music, and it works fine.excellent value!"
926,14,"there is a lot to love with the whole ecosystem that amazon has done with alexa. having own several echo dots that connects to external speakers, i decided to take advantage of the $20 off of the new echo.the good, it is sleek, the sound is full and the high end not overtly pierce-y.the bad, i found the bass too loud for my liking, and wished there was some way to tone it down.compared to the echo dot, the echo can be more finicky and do not always respond to it is wake word."
927,14,"alexa is a great smart companion. as the commercials like to point out, she is a lovely audio speaker. the issue is that most things i¡¯ve asked her to play require you to sign up for amazon music unlimited, even if you already have amazon prime. you can control the volume with your voice, but it only adjusts by one notch each time you say it, making you wonder by the end if it would not have been easier to get up and adjust it manually(assuming she has not heard you say ¡®turn off¡¯ instead of ¡®turn down¡¯, which is only about a third of the time). her skills are all very fun and she makes a great ambient noise machine. i¡¯d like to see them add a feature where you can chain multiple commands together instead of waiting for her to finish one and starting up with ¡°alexa,¡± again."
928,14,"bought this for my husband for christmas, overall we like it. the sound quality is fairly good-not exceptional, but decent.  sometimes when i ask the echo to look what i think would be easy things up i get some useless information that is not relevant.  my biggest complaint with this was it took 3 people 2 weeks to get this set up.  it was not terribly user friendly and had difficulty connecting it to my wi-fi.  now that it is working, though, we like it."
929,14,"i am very happy with all the alexas i purchased.  this second generation is made out of fabric.  i prefer the hard shell of the first generation, the tap and the dot.  so it remains to be seen how it will hold up.  it probably will be more of a dust catcher and not as easy to wipe it down."
930,14,"this is our first echo, and it is everything we expected and more. i use alexa to play music when i¡¯m doing chores liking making breakfast. the sound is more than adequate for that.  so far we have her set up to control just one lamp, which we can get her to turn it on or off from the top of the stairs. we remember to thank her often, and she always replies. she is so cute.  we¡¯re thinking of getting a second echo, but will the first alexa get jealous?"
931,14,"great sound performance with impressive bass.  i sometimes get frustrated with alexa and recognition of what i am saying, but that is true for all alexa devices so if you are good with alexa this is definitely a good option.i have compared this directly to the portable speakers which adapt to the echo dot and this is better - by far!"
932,14,"every time i see that email that says, ¡°what is new with alexa?¡± i know i¡¯m going to hate this thing more. slowly and over time, it becomes less responsive to words. ¡°alexa. set a timer for 25 minutes.¡± you do not have a smartphone connected. to connect a smart phone.... i got so angry today, i unplugged the damned thing for a while.it started out great but every time amazon updates the damned thing it just gets worse. i¡¯m going to have to invest in google home soon if this thing will not respond when i talk. it is a shame really. i liked the convenience of being able to do things without my phone."
933,14,"i now have 3 echos, 1 first generation and 2 second generation. the second generation models definitely sounds better than the first generation.i love that you can link them together to play music all over the house.the only reason i dinged them one star is because they do not always understand what i am saying. it might just be my speech, ha ha... i try to enunciate and speak clearly but they do not always get it right.i will probably be adding another one to my network a little later."
934,14,"edit: i am returning the unit.i had a good experience with amazon technical support and i think that some of my connection issues might be an issue with my unit.i had my wife bring home her tap that she uses in her office. if you put the 1st gen echo, tap, and 2nd gen echo in a line and do a sound test - in my opinion, the 2nd gen echo sounds about the same and possibly worse than the tap. it does not sound remotely as good as the 1st gen. i do not expect bose or sonos quality - but to my untrained ear this one sounds significantly worse than the 1st gen. it is flat and distorted at high volume.do not know how amazon is selling this as an updated ""upgrade"" from gen 1. and shame on dolby for attaching its name to it.--------------------------------------i have 3 of the original echos. good enough sound and never had any real problems with them. definitely a useful and enjoyable part of our home.i suppose they might fix some of the stuff through firmware or updates of some kind - but this echo is a miss. as others have pointed out, the sound quality is poor. i am not an audiophile but i would classify it as flat. like the sound i would get out of my cell phone speaker in a good environment.i also find there to be a slight lag in alexa responses. this is similar to the echo dot but i never experienced that with the last generation echo.finally, i have also had connection problems. it can not possibly be positioning because it currently resides in the same location as a previous generation model. at random intervals, the internet connection will drop and at times it will lose connection with the network altogether. i then have to unplug and replug it back in.super disappointing. i like the look but i think the product has gone in the wrong direction."
935,14,audio quality significantly better then on echo dot. plenty of power to fill decent size room.lots of fun for kids with all sorts of activities. however actual search results are lacking significantly behind that other home control device.i bought a jbl branded competitor device. and enjoy it more then this.for 3 reasons.1) built in battery2) better search results3) even better sound quality
936,14,"a substantial upgrade over the first model. the inclusion of a 3.5mm jack makes this a useful music player, since you can now route your music to better speakers, and the microphone has improved. no more shouting over the music to get the echo to acknowledge a command.i will knock off one star because of the app.  it is confusing and difficult to navigate. but since you will not use it that often, it is not a deal breaker."
937,14,"best model yet. the entire range of sound reproduction is a dramatic improvement over the already awesome dot. just look at the difference insize and you can see the potential especially in the bass area. cannot compare the new echo with the first generation, as i did not ownthe original. the new unit has a very substantial heft. it sounds amazing on voice and music. the sound is truly room filling. it has worked flawlesslysince purchase in december. wifi set up up is super easy. love the corny jokes and puns from alexa. we are into trivia programs. thank you formaking a quality product that is fun to use, and actually works as advertised, out of the box."
938,14,"this echo is a surprising let-down. asked her to play the rolling stones, and she played songs which i never heard before. and she does this habitually with any artist we request. i have $100 dust collector on my table.thank you amazon for another disappointment."
939,14,after reading reviews of sound i was hesitant to try. i think its great. i use it seperately and connect it through blue tooth to my soundbar.
940,14,"third alexa and considering getting more. she does what you ask and makes like easier. only feature needing improvement is the search feature but im sure that amazon will figure that out soon. maybe incorporate bing search engine? we use the music and whats new skills daily. best of all is the black friday pricing, almost half cost of our first alexa."
941,9,i bought this for myself after christmas and so far the family loves it. my four year old loves to ask alexia to fart. my ten year old loves to play 20 questions. i love the music. my husband likes to ask her dirty questions (which alexia does not answer) lol. but it is a lot of fun!
942,11,"new version of echo definitely sounds better than the first edition, but i have to admit the google assistant has a leg up in the lower frequencies."
943,0,"does everything as advertised, & everything i expected. amazing technology! it is like having a live roommate you can not see. it was a little tricky & confusing setting up(at least for me). when asking it questions though, you really need to be precise about your question, or alexa will give you a lot more than you asked for. the speakers also put out some amazing sound for their size. i am going to buy one for my daughter for her birthday or christmas. overall.... ""i love it!""."
944,14,"very sturdy, good sound. set up is very simple for all the echo products. i love alexa... in the 60 days since we received our first echo we have added two dots, the show, a fire stick, 3 compatible outlet plugs and 6 light-bulbs. we are constantly discovering new ways to use them - communicating with one another, sharing to do and shopping lists, playing games. great for managing home, schedules, music, entertainment, etc."
945,14,"i have both the first generation and second generation echoes. i enjoy them both. plus i have two echo dots. they are pretty good. the only thing i do not like about them are they do not work that good in japan where i currently live. you have to be very specific about the weather and no traffic reports at all. other than that it is pretty good for spell checking, math, and just a general conversation. i enjoy the echoes and look forward to more products coming in the future."
946,14,after using it for 2 days the music would cut off every 2 hours
947,14,"this is a great device. it sounds good as a speaker and you can play music from multiple locations with its connectivity to the dot and other speakers. it can also perform many more functions,like controlling electrical switches, light bulbs, thermostats,etc. you can ask alexa questions as well. i purchased two more as gifts for family members. ( some needing hubs and some not, but all needing compatibility). it is supposed to get smarter all the time. this is a really great device."
948,14,awesome sound from a little speaker. this is a room filling sound do not get me wrong. the skills are great i use some to help me sleep and then to find information i need to know. very easy to set up. you can buy more than one or add the dot to other rooms and you can connect them together and have music playing all over the house no need for any expensive stereo systems or big bulky speakers. i would recommend it to anyone.
949,14,"oh yeah,  i  love my toys. this one was lonely so i bought it some company - both the full sized echoes and dots.  i did not stop there, i  wanted to automate my lighting, both indoor and out so i  bought echo compatible wall switches and plugs.  so far everything is working fine.  thank you amazon - you are my new toy store. btw, if you are thinking about adding wall switches,  make sure you have an assortment of wire nuts on hand.unrelated thought, occasionally reboot your router and network swiches. it is just good practice - i try to do mine monthly."
950,11,i like the new form factor & cover material. i have not really noticed any difference in sound quality over the two 1st generation echos that i own.
951,14,"the list of phrases it comes with is lackluster forcing you to try and find the magic words to active it. if i want to play a playlist from spotify it is ""alexa, play playlist **** from spotify"" instead of just ""alexa play playlist ***"". this may sound like simple phrasing everyone with an alexa would know but i had to figure out that i had to say spotify rather than the instructional book telling me. after figuring out all the phrases for alexa and the key words for other apps it has turned out to be an amazing device to have around my home and i would recommend it to anyone looking for such a media device to have around.ps. the echo has an amazing speaker in it too."
952,14,"so i thought i would one of these echo speakers because i went to best buy and the one they had on the shelf that sounded great!  so i waited and waited to buy the speaker.  then i decided wanted to buy the set of three.  when i got them it did take a little longer to set up than i expected.  like 4 hours.  i am not very tech savvy.  but i did get them set up.my dislikes: you can only connect one speaker at a time to through bluetooth.i would like to connect all three speakers to one bluetooth connection.  example: i would like to say: alexa to connect ""everything to macbook pro.""  that is not an option. so sad:(  but not a deal breaker.my likes: i love the sound of one, two, or three speakers working at once.  i can use three speakers while playing my own amazon library or to my pandora account.admittedly, i am not done figuring out my new speakers.  so i will update my review later.one note:i am seeing a lot of reviews saying the sound of the new echo 2 is crappy.  since i had checked out the echo 2 speakers at best buy prior to ordering, i did not pay any attention to those reviews prior to placing my order.  however, i did take caution when i opened the first speaker.  i did not remove the protective plastic sleeve.  ""just in case there was anything to the bad sound reviews"".  hum.... just like the other reviewers, the speaker sounded pretty crappy!!! then i removed the protective plastic around the speaker and voila the sound was as terrific as advertised.  happy customer!  yay!!"
953,11,enjoying the device. the sound quality is better than i expected. it is in my kitchen and i sm really using it to stream music. i have the dot as well. the grey tone is quite attractive. ps i plugged my dot into my older bose cd player to boost the audio and i am quite pleased.
954,9,"i bought it because i thought it was gonna be useful, but not that much... it turns out it is awesome! so many things it can do! the sound is really good and powerful, perfect to listen to music."
955,14,"i purchased my echo for mainly listening to music. i read some negative reviews regarding the sound quality, but if this was an issue, it definitely has been fixed. this little unit puts out a big sound and the quality is great. connecting the echo to your wifi is easy and free, although you will need an account on amazon. my only complaint is that the music choices are limited. if you want to ask alexa to play any song, you will have to sign up for amazon enhanced music, which costs $3.99/month. i signed up for the enhanced music option and have been thoroughly enjoying it, especially when entertaining. your guests can ask alexa to play their favorite song, and it will be hours of fun."
956,11,looks great - but the sound quality is terrible - this is a real shame i was looking forward to receiving this but its a big disappointment. by the 1st generation for sure!
957,14,"this is single handily the best gift i gave this christmas.  i helped my aunt with the set up and it was so easy i could not believe that is all you had to do.  download the app on your iphone or android device and your off and running.  the echo was easy to give commands to and can hear you  from 20' away.  the sound quality was fantastic and sounded like it was coming from all around the room and this coming from someone who is deaf in one ear.  if i was to make one recommendation and that is not to have your phone connected through blue tooth unless you are using a app on your phone to stream to the echo.<u+00a0>all-new echo (2nd generation) with improved sound, powered by dolby, and a new design - charcoal fabric"
958,9,"i purchased this as a gift for my husband.  he loves it.  alexa is neat, you just talk to her and she does what you want.  ¡°alexa, play stairwsy to heaven by led zeppelin ¡° and boom, there it is.  the sound quality is really good also.  neat little gadget for my techie husband."
959,0,"first use - review:works fantastically. what a great system. understands language commands and responses are very quick. sound is very good, clear & if not loud, quite sufficient for listening to music at a normal level. this is one of those ""things"" that you like (when you do not understand it), and probably will love it, after some basic familiarization. already worth the investment at the new-user level. i would suggest it for any age."
960,10,"i am very much amazed at the sound and capabilities of the echo 2, it sits in our house where we can hear the sound in several different rooms and it sounds great. the voice response is very nice, clean and easy to use! now we look forward to exploring the capabilities of our new echo, especially with  automation as 'we' are inspired by this marvelous new technology. thanks amazon, for another well thought out product."
961,14,a bit smaller than the original and just as well made. these gadgets have made our lives easier. we also enjoy a good laugh now and again.
962,14,"we got the echo because our daughter got the google for for christmas. we use kindles so chose the echo over google. we love the games, the news and reminders that are available on the echo. the ability to listen to whatever music we want at just a simple request is fabulous. i find the echo is much more versatile than the google gadget. i highly recommend the echo. we plan on buying another one and then the fire stick."
963,14,"totally worth the money <f0><u+009f><u+0092><u+00b0>!!!!! i received one as a gift and loved it so much i purchased one for the additional rooms in the house . you can stream your music off each of your echo enjoying the sound in each room . it is like having a personal assistant who will wake you up with the news of the day also giving you your town information. plays games , recognizes your voice, sings to you , tells jokes , etc.....,, you get the idea soooo many things that it is impossible to list . love - love - love .oh  i forgot to mention i purchased some for children for there home and one for grownup granddaughter and i can not wait to bless them with it for valentines day !! enjoy <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0089>"
964,14,"i regret my purchase. i own many amazon devices and this one is the biggest disappointment. the sound is tinny and missing the bass notes of the first generation. there is also cracking and popping frequently. i have had issues with the bluetooth connection when connected to my fire, where the sound suddenly cuts out. strangely, is does not occur with a bluetooth connection to my samsung galaxy s 7.  this experience will result in me hesitating to purchase new amazon devices in the future."
965,14,"this is a really amazing gadget.  i never used the previous generation(s), so i do not have a point of reference to compare.  but so far we are impressed by the speed by which it processes information and how quickly responds to various commands.  it has answers for most questions.  we are still learning the many things it can do."
966,14,"so far we like this. sometimes it thinks were talking to it even though we have not talked to it. we have linked family amazon account, but only seems to use the skills we have set up with the main account, not the other family account. has a difficult time understanding husband, but seems to work ok for me. hopefully this is something we use regularly and not a fleeting toy. can hear us from another room most of the time."
967,14,"there are many questions alexa does not know.  it is a handy tool but there is a learning curve on how to ask questions.  the news comes in at different volumes, which is annoying when a user is hearing impaired.  some news reports are too loud and others too soft to hear.  the sound should be consistent for all of them.  often tasks must be added to the app before it will function.  lists can be controlled by voice, but to remove an item the app must be used.  if voice can add, why not delete items?  improvements surely are forthcoming but there are no security safeguards for voice ordering, so it seems best to leave that feature turned off for the device seems eager to order things without giving price information and just with a query.  it is entertaining, but after the 30 day trial is over there are charges for too many things that were advertised as features that appeared to come with the device.  all-in-all it is worth the price we paid on promotion, but not sure full price would have been.  especially with all the add on costs to customize the skills."
968,14,"excellent sound, always understand and syncs with other devices well. only thing i do not like is that you can only put an item in one group. i would like different groups for music for different rooms."
969,10,"i love my echo! i always had the tv on so i could listen to pandora but now i just tell alexa what i want to here and what channel.  i want one upstairs.  she is so convenient. i can tell her to pause, to play whatever station,  tell me a joke,  what is the weather, how to spell a word. she is awesome.  i love that i do not have to get up and turn the volume up or down when the phone rings or when a song is louder than the one before etc. being disabled, or even if i were not,  i would totally recommend the echo.  i love it!"
970,14,"when we got one of these, we did not really think we would use it too often. however it works great as a speaker for casual music listening (this is not a speaker for audiophiles), as an assistant in the kitchen, and as a good source for information. we use the built in list feature to keep our shopping list up to date all the time. cooking and you use the last egg? just ask alexa to add it to your shopping list! you can access the list while at the store so you do not forget anything. want to just relax and listen to music? with prime music you can create any station or use pre-built ones to listen to anything you want!this device truly surprised, and we hope to add more to our home soon!"
971,14,"better sound but could have been improved even more. took the ring on top for volume control away. that should have still been offered with this echo. and since amazon is not showing the tap any more this model should have offered the mobile option.i love having the echo is in my home and use them for everything, lights on off and dimming, thermostats, garage door open & close, music and news and weather even controlling the christmas lights and tree."
972,10,i can not believe this little device is so amazing.  it is so easy to set up  and interact with it.  i was also surprised as how well it was able to pick up my voice from across the room without me having to shout at it.  this was one of the best purchases i¡¯ve ever made in a long time.
973,14,"very satisfied with this product. showed it off to my fam and the expected critical comment was, ""this will not only make you lazy but dumb"". -hahaha!although, the concept of this echo is very helpful for the older generation... grandma will not have a hard time to shuffle on her phone book to find a number or have a hard time dialing a number, she just say the word ""alexa , call my stupid son!"" and voila the stupid son was summoned :) if it is connected to your household fixtures eg light, tv, etc... grandpa will not have an incident of stumbling on the floor to find the remote control, or them grannies will not have a heated fight on who to turn on or off the lights. the most liked feature is finding your favorite kind of music. the volume is friendly to the diminishing hearing function of the oldies too :)i have not explored those function yet on my alexa, but they do have that right? :p(reviewed by the rn wifey)"
974,14,"i bought this as a gift for my sister for christmas. i was originally planning on just setting it up for her and giving it to her but i liked it so much i bought another one for me. it is super easy to set up, all you have to do is download the app on your phone and have wifi. it is a great speaker and it connects to your fire t.v which is awesome for me because i always lose my remote in the dark when i need to pause my show. great build quality and music sounds great through it."
975,9,"we received the echo as a gift and have loved it!  i mainly use mine for playing music and love the convenience of telling alexa what song i want to hear while i am cooking. my grandsons love telling alexa what song they want to hear and she has not even gotten frustrated with all the constant requests!  we also have a dot that we keep in the bedroom that is so convenient for listening to music while i get dressed.  we bought one for both of our daughters as gifts and they love theirs, too."
976,14,"bought this because it was on black friday sale. its good and i love the design of it but not worth the extra money if you do not get it on sale. i have the echo 1st gen and constantly listen to music on it because the sound quality is still better than this even after amazon boast about having improved the speakers and given multiple firmware updates to correct the problem. loyal amazon customer, 2 dots, 2 echos, 1 look. was expecting more from this upgrade beside its looks. another thing that sticks out is that the only way to adjust the volume now is by voice or by a + and - button, no more dial."
977,10,"alexa has become part of my daily routine. i ask her about the weather and the traffic. she makes my home smart via voice and the alexa app. when i want to listen to music, it is easy to ask.she does not always hear me right. she does not always get it right. but she does more than enough to satisfy me for a digital assistant."
978,14,the amazon echo is one of the greatest products ever made at an affordable cost.  this is my second echo and i would say that the second generation is very similar to the first generation.  i do not find any big upgrade but both are great. alexa is the best voice recognition device. sound is as good as expensive speakers and love it for music. i just upgraded all of my indoor lights to work with alexa and it makes life a bit easier
979,14,"amazon would be smart to include a big red notice in the echo box that said - do not listen to music until the system updates to the latest version, and include the version number.  the first thing i did was listen to music, and it was terrible,  then i started reading the reviews, and found that it had shipped with a very old version of software, even older than the bad ones that were noted in the reviews in nov 2017. my unit must have been sitting in a warehouse for many months! that said, the sound is reasonable with the new software."
980,9,"gave as a gift and my parents really like it! also gave a dot to 4 family members! they were all very excited, excellent quality!"
981,9,"my fiancee has been wanting one for months, so he got it for christmas.  we love it!  one of the best purchases i have ever made.  i am not even sure what all alexa can do yet, but she can set alarms, order pizza, play christmas music, tell you mid-song who the artist is, et cetera."
982,14,"we got this as a holiday gift, and it is an upgrade from the dot we have had for some time. the sound quality and volume are great! this is a great little music player and entertainment center, which is how it used in our home. the only drawbacks i have encountered are that i frequently have to reenter my sirius account information and, for some reason,  alexa starts babbling from upstairs when we are in our living room.  it was a little creepy at first. now, it is just funny."
983,14,"i love my first generation echo and was excited about this second generation for another room. overall, i think the audio is too boomy and not of the same audio quality as my first generation. i have allowed all the firmware updates to occur but wish there were tone controls that i could access to adjust the individual drivers or levels."
984,14,"just got it today. ""setup"" was super easy, it took just a few minutes. the quality of the sound is excellent, its crystal clear and i was surprised at the bass (i listen to heavier music), it beats my other wireless speaker by a mile!! the echo itself is nice. simplistic, yet elegant. i personally like the lights, i thought that was a pretty cool touch. i purchased the ""sandstone"" one, which is neutral and fits the lighter decor in the particular room its in. i m very pleased with it. would gladly buy again! i cant wait to hook up some of my smart lighting!"
985,14,great product.  setting up was a breeze.  i now have full control of my smart home lighting.  it is nice to just say what you want have have it done.  i am surprised how well alexa can hear me so far away.  even sometimes in a very noisy situation.  good sound from a small form factor i use it mostly for ambient music and to control my lighting and locks.  i would recommend for anyone who could use assistance for mobility issues or just to have some cool fun.
986,11,"the echo is great, and alexa is great. i only wish that the volume ring was back in this version... i miss it from the first generation echo. in comparing the sound fro the first-generation echo, i can not tell much of a difference. the sound is better on my google home. on the echo, sound is a bit flat to my ears. the microphone picks up very well though, as good or better than my google home, and the first-generation echo."
987,9,"i bought this for my parents. my mom has alzheimer is and i was afraid that if dad every fell and could not reach his phone, she would not be able to call us. now dad can tell alexa to call me or my sister from any room downstairs because i got this and an echo dot. it works wonderfully for this purpose and dad uses it to check the weather, time his baking times and to listen to music. great invention for older people."
988,14,"pros:workmanship and quality of the echo is top notch.  setup was a bit confusing (took roughly 1 hour) due to issues getting echo on my home wifi.  sound quality is very good for a monaural speaker.cons:alexa is ai is limited regarding information sources.  it would be a great deal more useful if google queries were possible out of the box, or with the addition of a skill app.i am a prime member, however, access to the full prime music is still limited without paying an additional monthly fee.i have no desire to order from amazon using alexaone feature of the echo is having alexa read your kindle downloads.  sadly, alexa is ai voice is rather monotonous and does not make for an enjoyable listen for more than a minute or two."
989,14,"seemed like a good idea, but currently the implementation is just lacking.voice detection is decent, but limited in some ways and this undercuts the idea of the device being convenient to have to go back through the app to try to fix/change things.the app itself sucks, but all setup most be done through the app, so when we have had power outages or internet outages, the wifi had to be reset and the app makes that a miserable experience."
990,14,"got one each for my two boys' rooms. gotta admit i was a bit jealous of the much improved sound quality. but i got an echo plus to avoid the issues with hubs and my sound quality is right on par. i love my original echo (been with them since they first shipped), but this new generation sounds even better. they are not concert speakers and will not knock out the windows in your room, but they have great bass and fantastic all around sound!"
991,14,this is pretty good. way better than siri which is a joke. alexa has a hearing problem i think but leaps and bounds ahead of anything before it. lots of skill even though they do not all work perfect. it has plenty of issues but still very useful 80% of the time. does not always know what your saying but is learning. hooked right up to my thermostat and connected outlet.  amazon has some more work to do but it is going to great.
992,14,"it is hard to find anything bad about the echo.  since getting one i have connected my lamps/lights with smarthome and also my nest thermostat.  there is nothing better than adjusting the heat/ac from your bed - what is worse than waking up freezing in the middle of the night and having to walk to the thermostat?! ""alexa, turn the temperature up 5 degrees""...done, love it.  you can pretty much control everything through the echo.  for music, it works best with amazon music - however you can still sync pandora, siriusxm, etc.  it is $3.99/month for amazon music, which is well worth it - the library is extremely extensive; i was even able to find songs by non-mainstream local artists i would have never thought they would have in amazon music.  for the price of the echo, it is worth every penny.  i plan to get echos as gifts for family and friends; everyone who is come to my home and tried it thinks it is so cool.  alexa is my girl!"
993,0,"this thing is pretty darn cool!  i will be honest, though...it is slightly lacking in some areas.  when i ask it a question, for example, sometimes it will basically ignore me.  it will light up when it hears ""alexa"", but will just turn off after i ask it the question.  it is random questions that are asked when it behaves this way.  it also says ""sorry, i do not know that one"" an awful lot.  it has some improvements to make, but it is still overall a really great device.  i would say it is worth the price."
994,10,"wonderful personal assistant!  i enjoy playing games like jeopardy and millionaire quiz game, listening to a variety of music,  being able to send messages from my echo to others in my complex who also have echo.  ordering by voice.  asking about the weather, the time, setting reminders.  etc. etc. etc."
995,14,bought for wife for xmas she loves it. had new years party plugged it into stereo thru aux cable and guest requested own music and it played thru my stereo system like your own voice activated juke box. now back in kitchen an she uses daily for timer weather etc etc
996,14,i previously owned the 1st gen echo and currently own a few echo dots (1st and 2nd gen).  i really like the looks of this 2nd gen model which i bought for my parents as an xmas gift.  i was worried that they wouldnt use it or would not like it but my 2 non-tech savvy parents have grown to love it.  my mom uses it most for creating grocery shopping lists & my dad uses it most for asking when sports teams play next.
997,14,"i normally do not write reviews but in this case i had to. my 86 year old mother had a stroke recently and lost her eyesight. i purchased the echo so she could voice dial.  the echo fit the bill.  as with any older person not familiar with technology it is a matter of training them and getting them to use the product. after i installed the echo and working with my her, i asked her to simply check the news, weather, and her calendar every morning.  to my surprise she started doing that the same night.  she also listened to music for over an hour.  this is a simply amazing product and it certainly will make my mom is life so much easier."
998,14,echo is responsive and smart. i love the flash briefing skills and the sound is much better than what i expected. the microphone array picks up the wake word over the loudest music and it works really nicely as a bluetooth speaker for my iphone. i love it so much that i am going to invest in some smart home devices to control with ifttt and will likely buy a few dots to spread around the house. very useful and i would highly recommend!
999,14,"i am still learning it is capabilities. the android app was flaky; it locked up several times. but, i was able to do the echo setup, without problems, from my laptop computer. i mostly wanted it for its internet radio capabilities (e.g. ""alexa, play <call sign or frequency> radio"") but also find it interesting to ask it questions, such as for weather reports (anywhere in the world!), or even cooking times/temperatures. great device.others: alexa, pause. alexa, resume. alexa, louder. alexa, softer."
1000,11,"impressed for the size.  while it is not a bose speaker it actually has good sound for its size.  i have listened to many portable speakers and have cringed at the ""sound"" they put out but this does not fit in that category.  good for listening to music if you not looking for the floor shaking subwoofer.  the echo show has slightly better low sound i think but also has the higher price tag to with it.  if you need a display screen and marginally better low sounds go with the show, if not get 2 of the echo second gens."
1001,11,"no improved sound at all... amazon echo first generation sounds waaaaay better than this generation, i change back to my old echo and put the new one somewhere in the house. mic got well improved and how it looks is astonishing beautiful... but echo users (like me) mostly were looking for sound quality.... here is my suggestion ... do not change your regular echo for the 2nd generation."
1002,10,"i received this as a gift because honestly i was a skeptic.  i did not think i needed it because i can use my cell phone for all the things that echo can do.  however i absolutely love it.  i seldom have to pick up my phone at the house anymore.  it can do so many things and it is only getting smarter:making phone calls and sending textssetting timers, playing gamesplaying musicasking for jokes, weather, sports,i can not imagine my life without it!"
1003,0,"works perfectly, but to be honest,  it does not do much for me.  i am not one to talk to ""alexa"" for jokes and all that other stuff.  it rarely knows anything.  i am better off checking google.  on the whole it is very disappointed in what it is useful for."
1004,9,"love our new addition to the echo family.  love the cover too.  we have two echos ( 1st and 2 nd editions) and two dots, one i put a pretty denim cover on for the kitchen.. i use them all the time for timers and at night to listen to rainstorms to fall asleep or drown out other noises."
1005,11,i am disappointed in the overall sound compared to the previous echo generation. i also miss being able to rotate the top to adjust the sound. on the upside it does recognize my voice much easier with the volume up than the previous model. that is the only improvement i see.
1006,14,i like its verity of devices it works with the sound quality is awesome. voice recognition is great.however the most disappointing part is it uses bing search engine and rarely has the answers i am looking for. something as simple as what wines pair with certain foods she sometimes does not know. i find myself using google assistant more on my phone then asking alexa questions plus with google assistant you can continue the conversation and ask anothrr related question with out repeating the whole thing. feels more like an assistant.i will say that i love amazon prime music and alexa that alone is worth it to me.  she is great and when compared to the lack of compatability to the google home it is definitely better. i just wish they would have chose a better search engine. a lot of my friends say the same that is way the 3 stars
1007,14,"i do not hate the echo; i hate my echo. i have ordered a total of 8 echo devices as gifts for friends and family, and they all love them, sadly enough the one i kept to myself seems never to work or is always having an issue understanding me, since i am out of the return window, i had reached out to amazon/alexa support and they had me try something and they ran some test, over a spand of 2-3 weeks, the last i heard (which was about 2 weeks ago) that the tech could not find anything wrong but even the rep on the phone agreed with me that something is apparently wrong from just what he heard via over the phone when i tested the echo with him, he said someone would get back to me, but no one has, this is after i have ordered (through amazon) the philips hue light bulbs to use in my house with the echo, but since my echo does not work i had to order extra asssoriers to link to the hue so i can turn my lights on in my home. overall i am disappointed in the lack of service i got with the echo support. it does not seem like this will be ever corrected."
1008,14,i bought the echo speaker because i needed a device of quality to play music when i¡¯m home. it functions exactly as i expected and does the job. the speaker is very handy and convenient if you need to move it around or travel with it and the sound quality is top.
1009,11,"i owned (still do) a first generation echo.  this new edition has improved sound, and is quite smaller and less obtrusive at the same time.  i opted for charcoal grey fabric, and to me aesthetic it is a nice touch, a little more subdued looking, less clinical than the glossy black finish of the 1st gen.  only thing i would have like to see retained on the 2nd gen is the rotating volume ring.  the new model has +/- volume  buttons like the echo dot."
1010,10,love this device! i thought it would be cool but it has exceeded my expectations. i get up in the morning walk into the kitchen get the morning message from alexa and then proceed to get the weather and traffic from her. then i have her play whatever morning music i am in the mood for. all of this happens instantaneously and seamlessly. if i am cooking a meal in the evening she can help with that and play me whatever music i feel like as i am working. did i mention i love this thing?
1011,14,as a christmas gift it was one of the best i have gotten . plugged it in and went to the echo app on my phone and started using it.  one of the features i like is that i have paired it with my amazon fire tv and i have hands off operation of my entertainment world. alexa can find any move i want.  still learning but that is fun too. really nice sound quality also. installed a bluetooth device on my tv and now the sound quality is much better coming from the echo.
1012,14,"the speaker is great quality. alexa is terrible. playing spotify music with her is an awful experience. you cannot default spotify as the music choice so you have to add in the words ""on spotify"" to every music command. the ability to create device groups to play music is a joke, it is easy to setup and turn on but that is about it because it does not actually work that well. once that device group is playing audio it is impossible to get alexa to stop playing on the group and back to one device again. the device group audio also seems to suck up bandwith(which i have plenty w/ service @150mb), i only have two devices in my group (echo dot + echo), because one of the speakers cuts out very frequently. it results in a feature i do not want to use, and was a primary reason i bought the devicealexa can answer basic questions and set timers at a high % but amazon is ability to deliver on the software end to create a consistent and enjoyable media device needs major work."
1013,14,"i think i misunderstood the advertised purpose of the echo (i will take blame for that).  i mistakenly thought the echo could be used as sort of a ""search engine"" to get info from the internet.  sure, it tells you the weather, controls your lights, plays music, but if you ask alexa something the least bit ""complex"", it either responds with an answer that does not have anything to do with what you asked, or, it responds with ""i am still learning about that"".  it seems to be geared toward assisting you with your daily chores...or entertaining you.  but it is not helpful when you ask for info that you would normally google.  the echo is something nice to have but, it is not as robust as i thought it would be.  again, it is my own fault for not researching the product more deeply (which i usually do)."
1014,14,"i have 2 gen 1 echos, a gen 2 dot, and this device.  the sound quality in this device is far better than its predecessors, but bluetooth has not noticeably improved. i have several brands of headphones and bluetooth speakers which work flawlessly with my tv, iphone and ipad, but horribly with all of my echo devices. amazon...you must fix this. it is the weak link in an otherwise great technology and service."
1015,14,"alexa is echo has been performing smoothly for the most part, quick responses and clear sounds even when music is high she is still able to be triggered with her name. she has her moments when u will say something and she is clueless or goes somewhere else with it, however it is not very often for it to be a concern. another issue would be start my day, i would like for it to be more customized so u could edit it more specific like word of the day in the flash brief and have it play all at once and calendar too on starting my day. i do not have a whole lot of bad things to say about it than good things. it is a great device and performs how i wanted it to for the most part"
1016,14,"so far, i am really impressed with this useful gadget. i purchased it to replace my fm radio but i have discovered it does far more. the voice recognition is excellent and the ai program makes alexa;s responses and help pretty on target. however, i still think that amazon can do better in having it linked to the wifi system. i had several incomplete attempts. it would get 5 stars if the wifi integration would have been simpler and worked better."
1017,14,i liked the first generation so much i bought this new version as a second for downstairs. not impressed. stay with the gen i device - much more reliable. keeps dropping my starbucks app - keeps telling me i have to install it - did it 5x - apparently that is not enough. randomly talks to you and plays music without being asked to. no issues after 3 years with gen i - would not trade it for the world. you can keep this one.
1018,14,"always thought the echo was a novelty and did not see the need to buy one. we were given one and found that we use it a great deal. timers and music in the kitchen, controlling wemo lights from the couch, checking the weather while we get ready for the day.... none of these things are going to change the world but it is a fine convenience.i wish the audio commands did not have to be so precise. makes for some awkward ""not quite what i asked for"" moments. also, it is annoying that it will only play music that is on amazon is library. though connected to the internet it will not access any song you want."
1019,14,"i am quite impressed with the speaker in this thing, and it really hears my voice well, even from different rooms. it is a bit of a pain to first setup, but once you have got it going, it is lots of fun. good that amazon send an email with instructions once it is shipped."
1020,14,"sound is good, i think people give it a bad rap and expect the sould to be like a pair of bose speakers. the one issue i found is with the microphone, when i use the calling feature people are complain i do not sound clear and i have no issues with my dot and other echo. even tried moving it to a new room."
1021,10,"so far so good. i¡¯m enjoying playing with alexa and finding new uses for it. i mostly use it for music in the kitchen, asking about the weather, the timer, the news. my husband likes my new toy too. no issues thus far. will update if i have any problems. easy to set up."
1022,0,"i guess i have not really been able to figure out what it does, other than tell us the weather and some rather bad jokes. it will also play music, which is cool -- and it sounds phenomenal -- but sadly, it does not sync to itunes. sigh. i do not know, i guess there are uses for it, but i do not know what they are. like, i do not want to say, ""order a box of garbage bags,"" or whatever, because that seems like a really easy way to spend money. fast. i will update this review when i figure out  more what the echo can do."
1023,14,"nice and loud speaker, with great voice pickup capabilities. i have one in every room, all of the echo line are great products and when diving into the smart home world make life so much easier. these would easily get 5 stars if one feature was added, and that is microphone sensitivity. being that my livingroom and kitchen have an open room design my kitchen echo often overrides my livingroom which can be frustrating, but with some voice level control on the user end this is manageable."
1024,14,"after reading many reviews,i decided to purchase the echo. the quality of the speakers are amazing and do not need an alarm clock anymore-alexawakes me up at the desired time every morning. the device has many features which are helpful and fun.  my only gripe is the kasa app will not work properly on my kindle fire and my low end smart phone does not have the app. i am unable to set up an account which is  frustrating...not able to get help from tp link or amazon.that is why i have given my review four stars instead of five my main purpose for purchasing the echo was to use the voice recognition for the lights in my house."
1025,14,"returning!! was excited but ended up so disappointed. will not stay connected to my wi-fi for more than 3 minutes! tried forever, too frustrating! not worth the aggravation. i actually was able to get it to stay connected long enough to ask it to play one song. it sounded good, but right at the very end, it disconnected from my wi-fi! tried multiple locations in my house! this thing had my blood pressure up!"
1026,14,"it was relatively easy to set up, has a good range & has no problem understanding different voices & accents.i bought it mainly to use as a radio to play music, the sound is very good.bonus features - it is a handy kitchen timer, the list skill is useful, i can turn my outdoor fountain (and other devices) on & off using a smart plug.the ability to answer questions or demonstrate particular skills is not as flawless as it might be. your requests need to be made in a standard way to get a correct response (it is not human!!).i look forward to seeing what new updates will bring.a fun device."
1027,14,i am amazed at the sound and quality of this echo. it can also blend in at any household and not an eyesore to see like other products.pro-sound quality- music sounds great on thissize- not to small and not large at allprice- reasonable price for what you get.cons-music distorted at highest volume setting.if it was wireless also... definitely 5 stars from me.took a few times to connect to the internet during the initial setup... could be user error.
1028,14,"i cannot get my echo to loop soundtracks consistently throughout the night! i mainly purchased to play natural rain sounds to help kids sleep through the night. alexa verifies that loop mode is on after i ask her to , but it only plays for a few hours then something causes it to stop. the strange thing is that the alexa app shows that its still playing even though nothing is coming out of echo.what upsets me more is i have emailed numerous times and have not received any response (its been over a week) and i called customer service tech support and instead of letting me talk to tech rep i had to talk to a operator that had to relay back in forth between me and the tech????? after going back and forth for an hour i just hung up because i was getting nowhere. i absolutely love amazon and have been a prime member for years, but i honestly do not know why this issue cannot be fixed, or at least put the effort into  fixing the problem. i purchased 3 of these one for each kid is room. if they do not resolve this issue whether by updating echo, or the alexa app or whatever is causing this problem, i will be returning them before 30 days is up! please fix!!!! i still believe in you!update! november 6, 2017i was conacted by an amazon rep which inquired abour the problem i¡¯m having with echo not looping throughout the night! she stated that one of the technicians could not get an echo to replicate the problem. she said she will forward all my details to him and see if they can figure out what is going on, and get back to me if they figure it out. very nice representative that i¡¯m happy got in touch with me, but i still do not understand why i could not speak directly with an actual technician <f0><u+009f><u+00a4><u+0094>which in my opinion would increase the speed in resolving this issue. maybe i¡¯m just old school and this is the way matters get resolved nowadays. when i got off the phone i deleted the alexa app and reinstalled to see if that might clear up the problem, but my echos still could not keep my rain sounds playing throughout the night! i personally think the problem is with the alexa app, it is been pretty glitchy and if you read the reviews about the alexa app there are many negative reviews. either way hopefully they figure it out! i will update this review when i hear back from rep or it starts working correctly!"
1029,14,love everything about the echo! it makes me feel safe because i know i can get help very easily if i need medical assistance. also great because my husband can not hear well and does not talk on the phone or remember phone numbers of our children. he can get help easily by talking. i also love the drop in feature. i now have my shopping list with me at all times since i record my needs on the store list feature. also use the tell me a joke feature. i am the mc for a community singing group and need acceptable jokes to tell in shows we do at local nursing homes.i would like to put a dot in my bathroom so if we would fall getting in and out of the shower/tub i could get help. i was told there is a device that fits into the electrical outlet in the bathroom. did not know if it would be safe to have a dot connected by a cord considering all the moisture in the bathroom from showers. can you tell me what that device is and if you sell it? is there any info on using a dot in the bathroom?
1030,9,i absolutely love my echo. i loved it so much i got the dot right after buying this and was pretty unhappy with the sound quality of the dot so i will be buying another echo for multiple rooms of my house. this product is incredible and 100% worth the price
1031,14,echo is innovative and sounds great. improvement over older model. have 3 throughout home and all work as they should. disturbing statistics about amazon giving consumer information to over reaching law enforcement agencies. privacy will always be an issue with consumers and technology. but it sounds like amazon gives it over without any resistance. the price we all pay for cool gadgets. we are all suspect and potential criminals.
1032,0,"i love this thing. it is loud, i can hook it up to my spotify, and use it for so many functions. the only issue i have is that the voice recognition is not perfect. i find myself yelling at it to correct misunderstandings. i do not really have any sort of accent and try to speak as clear as possible when talking to alexa, but there are still some mishaps. i will definitely be buying more for the other rooms of my house though."
1033,11,"i question the improvement vs the echo 1st generation beyond the height and color. response time seems slower (with regards to giving commands), sound is not as good as original echo (play bohemian rhapsody by queen which hits extreme highs and lows). i would say it is a little better than the dot. probably should have gone with the echo hub unit."
1034,11,"sound quality is unfortunately worse. i was going to buy another one right before getting this one because i got obsessed with doing the whole house. the reviews are right, just not there in sound as much as the original.pros:- finish is cool, and nice looking than the originalcons:- after using it, the sound seems cheaper/too much treblei just bought a refurbished generation 1 to finish the rooms."
1035,14,"so i am 100% convinced it is just another way for the government to spy on us, but i admit it is pretty awesome. very very convenient for sure although it would be nice if you could tell it to do more than one thing at the same time. for example i can not tell alexa to plan an activity and set an alarm i have to do one and then the other, which is absolutely no problem at all i am just saying to let you know. be sure to explore the skills she has on the alexa app or just ask her. she has hundreds and they are what male her awesome. music is good, she can play playlists if linked to spotify and she can usually find the song by the key lyrics of the song itself. lots of games. be sure to do alot of research exploring what she can do just to take full advantage."
1036,14,"it is a great device. took me a little while to get used to. i could notice a difference in sound right away, which at first, was not a great thing. the sound seemed lower but it was definitely more clear. as time has gone by, i have grown to like it more. when playing music, i would have to tell at alexa if the music was too loud (1st gen). 2nd gen hears me well. if music is pretty loud, i have to talk louder but not the same. i do wish i could adjust the volume on the 2nd gen like you can with 1st gen. i also had to get used to the smaller build and fabric, etc. it did not seem as well built but i have no problems with it."
1037,11,"it works just like the first generation (original) echo and did not observe any improvement so far.  it is definitely not as nice as the original echo both sound quality wise and design.  i like the ring volume control of the original echo which is missing from the 2nd gen and only available on the 'plus'.  obviously, it is only half the costs of the original echo and smaller so i kind of expecting this."
1038,14,"just got this so time will tell on longevity.  i am writing this based on initial impression and audio quality.  i previously purchased an echo dot,  which was fine for basic things was lacking in audio capabilities.  the echo is world is better in the audio quality.  while it is not what i would consider audiophile quality,  it does sound very good for casual listening.  i have 2 full stereos complete with subs,  but sometimes i just want to listen to music without critically listening.  this is where the echo shines.  bass is actually pretty good for being the fact that it is fairly small.  but if you are a bass head you will not be impressed.  the build quality seems to be good also.  the best part for me though is the ability to play virtually any music i want just by asking and have it actually sound pretty good.  in short,  do not let the early reviews complaining about sound quality sway your decision.  all the issues have definitely been fixed."
1039,10,"i enjoy it.  she has not done that evil laugh i have been hearing about..which i am thankful for, but she comes in handy, espeically with timers, reminders, alarms, simple research, real time sports scores, music, etc.  good investment.  will def purchase next gen."
1040,0,i love it for music but i wish it was better at answering questions. tonight i asked her for ideas for leftover manicotti stuffing and she told me some weird stuff about some new zealand cheese farmers.  makes me wonder if i should have gotten a google home. i do like alexa though....i just have not found a ton of things to use her for. i do love that she will add things to my shopping list as i am in the kitchen.
1041,14,"love the echo! we actually purchased an earlier version and found it frustrating, so it went back to amazon. this time, they got it right and we are keeping it! alexa is smart and she can hear us from across the room! setup was super simple, too, and i¡¯m not so techy!"
1042,14,"we found this product to be lacking in knowledge when questions are asked. does not play songs asked, not as informative at siri!  all in all a total disappointment and we have given it an opportunity thinking the problem might be a lack of understanding on our part.now after our initial purchase we find that ""some window of opportunity"" to return the item has expired!  the item has simply sat on a mantle, not soiled our used, as if daily handling would have soiled the exterior!  and it is not like the echo will ever get better with time, so what do you suggest we do with it now?regrets"
1043,14,"so far so good. i would like to see what else she can do.my only issue so far is when i dictate a shopping list, if i say ¡®add milk, eggs, and bread to my shopping list¡¯ it adds ¡®milk, eggs, and bread¡¯ on one line. so when i go to the list i have:hairspraytoilet papermilk eggs and breadpeanut butteri could easily miss the list of items on the same line."
1044,14,"just bought this as a replacement for my tap that sadly died after 6 mos.  set up w/out issue, ran update, restarted... i started my playlist.  almost fell off the chair hearing this $100 device sound like a $5 speaker.  went through a few different artists/songs/genres trying to find improvement.  came here & read reviews on the sound before/after update. i checked several times if software was current, and it was.  i know what my 1st gen echo at home sounds like, this was not even close.  last hail mary was unplugging for a couple mins.  first track, no improvement.  headed to the returns page when track 2 came on.  holy cow.  not sure if it took a while for the update or what.. but finally it sounded much better.  minus a star for frustration.  while the sound quality still does not seem as good as the 1st gen, this newer model cost me $80 less."
1045,14,i am enjoying all the ways i can use my echo. only problem is with the timer. if i am in the next room i can not hear it even with the sound turned up. i am going to try to utilize the light and amazon television features as soon as i became more familiar with the echo.
1046,9,i had echo dots which i loved until i went to a friends house and they had the echo. love the sound quality and had to have one. i have a bose system and i can not till the difference when i listen to music. now i have echo in the living room and put one echo dot in bedroom and the other in basement family room. with free app i can ask and make request all over my house. worth the money even though i got a great price on the holiday sale.
1047,10,"received this as a christmas gift. love it even more than i expected. the sound quality is amazing! everyone that comes over comments something like ""wow, that is just that little speaker""..yep! plus alexa is totallt awesome!be sure to utilize her shopping list capability. being able to say ""alexa, add ___ to my shopping list"" and have that list on my phone when i go to the store is incredibly helpful."
1048,14,"first one was defective (would not stay connected).  amazon took it back, no problem.  the second one shipped worked great."
1049,0,"it has been a wonderful addition to the home.  we play games, listen to fun facts, hear jokes, start timers,  it is a fun tool to have if you just need some distractions.  love, alexa is  ability to play games.  occasionally she will not hear our words exactly as we say them.  she heard me say the correct state capital because she repeated back what i guessed, but told me i was incorrect and then gives me the name of the same city i just listed to her. not annoying, just funny."
1050,14,"i love echo. it is so handy, especially if i wanted to check how the weather was, play music, turn on/off the lights, and ring anyone on my contact list. this is my third purchase of echo, have this in 3 rooms. slowly accumulating, so i can have one in every room."
1051,10,i am seriously in love with this thing! i fully intend to totally equip my house for the echo to control. i am so happy with this purchase. it is an awesome example of technology making our lives (and online purchases) way too easy but with a busy life like mine i need that.
1052,10,"i was pleasantly surprised by the sound quality, it definitely is room-filling and clear. i am not a connoisseur of audio equipment, but i can say that the echo fulfilled my need for a speaker for my kitchen and dining room that would play music from different genres and always sound great. plus the whole family has had a lot of fun trying out different skills and discovering new ways to use it."
1053,14,"before i even get out of bed, alexa will turn on my lights, play music and tell me the weather. she is actually quite robust and can even lock my car, play games, become a sleep sound machine etc. my only complaint is i wish i had gotten one sooner."
1054,14,"like the sleep sounds most and the smart home device voice activation controls. but this system has a loooong way to go. often alexa does not understand what i am saying, and if your in same room while music on her is playing you have to yell alexa for her to hear you. sleep sounds times out often with a loud message from alexa waking you and our baby up. often requests for certain sleep sounds are suddenly unknown to alexa or she will play something else. calendaring is very basic and you cannot ask, next thing or next 5 appointments on calendar. she even misses the mark on voice activations for smart devices we use often and suddenly it does not understand or says something went wrong. $100 down the drain! we are looking into google."
1055,14,"i love the new echo to be honest i can not tell much diferanse in sound quality , but i like the new size and the ability to change its look i have a oak shell on order i have had a echo sense they were offered by invitiaion and hase used it as a base to make my home smart."
1056,14,"for this review i am going to be talking about the phisical product itself. not the alexa ai. the speakers are great! i think it sounds really good for the price you play. it can get very loud and go really quiet. it has great base and looks good in my opinion. the buttons on top are nothing special. they work. they do their job. the light ring looks pretty good. not as bright and vibrant as they could be, but that is a very minor complaint. i also like how you can change the shell of the echo as well. overall an amazing product and i highly recommend it."
1057,14,"we have a 1st generation that works fine.the 2nd generation can not play 10 seconds of audio without cutting out. sometimes it will time out trying to process a question. ""alexa, what is the weather like?"" ""it is cloud with a-"" ...10 seconds... purple light... ""alexa, what is the weather like?"" ""it is-"" ...5 seconds... ""-cloudy with a chance of rain."" we have got a zillion other wifi devices in our home that all work fine, including a google home and echo 1st gen.fired up a support call, they told me to send it back for replacement. they said it was working fine, and returned it to me... without a power cable. so now i can not even confirm that my defective 2nd gen echo is still defective, which i am pretty sure it is, assuming it is the same device."
1058,14,"i enjoy all of the alexa/echo products up to this point. i have the original echo, a dot, the second generation, and the tap. they come in very handy whether i use it for timers or mostly the music. i do wish that amazon would allow the echo music plan to play on all devices instead of choosing one at the same price instead of having to pay more for multiple rooms. i mean we already paid a lot for the devices and we are prime members why not just let them all play it?"
1059,10,"she is a handy helper, and actually helps with my dog is stress whilst away! i play audio books through her during my work hours, and the pup keeps calm (for the most part)i use her as a kitchen tool, for her timer, and reminder, and weather assistance!"
1060,14,"i enjoy this way more than i thought i would. i have it in my kitchen pass-through to the open living and dining area (as close to the center of our main level as i could get) and alexa can hear us from basically anywhere in the house (even the bedrooms as long as the door is open). having it near the kitchen is great for adding items to our shopping list as we run out, and the speaker is very powerful for such a small device. and i really love the walnut finish! overall very happy with the purchase."
1061,14,"we are getting used to echo and it keeps getting better. the wood grain design could not get any better. nice fit for our decor. very entertaining, indeed. did not have the first gen echo but the sound quality on this one is good enough for a room....kitchen, dining room. do not expect to rock it for a party. go ahead. play with alexa...she might even let you win a game of tic-tac-toe. i can use all my music apps  (amazon, pandora, google music) which is even better. i am now controlling my lights with this unit as well. fun!"
1062,14,"my 11 year old daughter and i love our amazon echo. i got it for christmas from my goddaughter. i never would have thought to have made this purchase, but i am glad she did. my favorites ... turning the channel on my fire tv stick, keeping track of the weather, daily reminders, wake-up alarms, bedtime stories (my daughter loves them), shopping lists and alexa can even say a variety of prayers, which tops everything else for me. i just ordered a smart lock for the front door, smart doorbells and several echo dots to put in every room so we can maximize the drop-in/intercom feature. i went out and purchased 4 smart light bulbs, but for $150 (for 4 bulbs) i wish i could remember to tell alexa to turn on & off the lights. i guess i am a creature of habit, because i continue to turn the lights off myself. i know now investing in more smart bulbs will not be put on my echo shopping list. :-) i do highly recommend the echo."
1063,14,love the echo!  sound is great.  plays music really well.  love all the skills that can be programmed.  works with fire stick too.  i would recommend it to others.  get the dot too.  that way you have alexa in another room.  surprisingly you can stream on both at the same time.
1064,14,"not sure how i lived without alexa all this time. that being said, the app leaves alot to be desired. you would think with all of amazon is tech skills they would figure out how to streamline and make more functional the essential infrastructural component that makes your echo tick. i am tech savvy, and i  had to screw around with this for awhile. they should include video tutorials on how to do things like make her do lists, access your calendar, etc. you need special apps to do that, there are several that say they do it, and no good way to know what works best for your needs. echo involves lots of trial and error to do the kinds of things they should make intuitive."
1065,14,junk junk junk! this unit will no work with a macbook pro! can you imagine that! it also will not set up with amazon prime account if you want to attach another phone number account! these people need to really go into common sense mode.... right out of the box it is pure 100% garbage.... really shame on you!!!?
1066,14,it would appear that saying alexa and alexia are very close and i might be guilty of doing so without even thinking.  saying alexia will cause echo to light up in a circle but not answer the question or command or not even respond at all.  i am going to rename my  alexa and call it  [or her]  echo and see if perhaps my initial reaction to alexa not responding was wrong.  i hope so as i like  the device so far.
1067,11,"bought as present for my mother.  i have the original echo, this one is smaller but does have better sound quality, though it may not get as loud as the original cause the speaker is smaller.  so if you want a loud system then consider something else."
1068,14,nice speaker with too much bass. needs more treble. other than that it does what and echo does. needs better voice recognition and search capabilities.edit: really poor technical support! the support is offshore and apparently provided by people reading from a script. there seems to be no way to actually reach someone stateside who knows more. be prepared to do lots of problem research on your own!
1069,9,my son loved my echo for when he came for a visit and so i purchased it for him. he is having fun with it and has figured out how to do so many things with it.  best part is leaving the messages over it. now i actually hear his voice instead of getting a text.
1070,14,"i have the 1st echo and it hears me fine...  this one does not hear me unless i am right on top of it.i received a replacement unit and it does the same thing, i have to be right on it for it to hear me.update:i got on a call with customer service, struck out on 1st girl..  finally got to peggy, she had me do a factory reset. it is working much better now. i think 1st gen still hears me further away. but at least it is usable now.well that only lasted a few days, now not hearing me unless right on top of it again..  plus alarm is so low i can not hear it. this unit is a big let down."
1071,14,"i got an echo dot for christmas and loved it, i bought this, another dot and the telephone echo to work with my ooma. when i went to connect it was not the same experience as the dot i got for christmas. after a few hours i gave up trying to get it to work. it maybe hit or miss with echo. i will wait until they improve. the idea is great but frustrating."
1072,14,"did not think i would like this at first.  it is become an indispensible time saver now.  do not have to stop and look things up on my phone or computer anymore. did you know alexa can look up recipes? she can also send the ingredient list to your phone to make buying them easier.  this is what technology promised bit was never able to deliver...before now.  convenience, time savings, money savings.  i love it."
1073,11,"i love this new echo. i like the size and the fabric cover. the speaker sounds great. my only reason for not giving it a 5 rating is because i was expecting more bass built into the small woofer. otherwise the speaker sounds great, the setup is easy and the functionality is fantastic."
1074,14,"the buttons are nice but i like the dial for sound better on gen 1. it is a little smaller. i find that i must talk louder to be recognized and that sets the 1st gen off in the other room. when that happens i have noticed the 1st gen is faster in response time to the question asked. i think the sound is not as good as the earliergeneration as well. it is ok but would not call it an upgrade over the previous generation. i can not give it lower than 3 but wish a 2.5 was available.i would stick with the 1st generation at this time and wait for them to make upgrades to the 2nd generation. so, up date, it is now 3/21/2018 and the speaker is failing, of course the return period is over now! not worth the money, will never buy again!"
1075,0,"i love it!  it is so fun.  i have heard some people are hearing things that come out of nowhere. i do not know how it happens, but i did hear something one day that sounded like part of a word.  i did not understand it, and i had not been talking to alexa.  all i know is i will not talk about very personal things or mention passwords, etc. while it is plugged in!  sounds like amazon needs to fix whatever hacking that may be going on."
1076,14,"i have 2 of the 1st gen and love them,1 dot, echo plus, and now echo 2nd gen... the 2nd gen is compact which is neither helpful or hurtful but i am still out that it is improved?  i gave my son one of the gen 1 and am now considering trading him back with the 2nd gen..  i miss my volume dial during the night... and several other small things.  if you did not own the 1st gen you should be very impressed... i¡¯m giving it the old college try..."
1077,14,"we¡¯re loving the new echo. the sound is significantly better than the 1st gen when listening to music. i have noticed this one is not quite as sensitive in regards to me speaking to it, i do sometimes have to repeat myself which i do not feel i do with my 1st gen echo. i love the color options too. such a convenient device that the whole household uses daily, i do not think we could live without alexa anymore!"
1078,11,"i love my original echo and i had high hopes for this product.  i ordered it on the day it was released!  unfortunately, the sound quality is not nearly as good as it is predecessor.  i wish i had spent the extra $50 and bought another original."
1079,14,"i have the original echo, in fact was one of the first ever sent out.i placed my original order two months ahead of its release. i have just purchased 3 additional ones for my daughter, son-in-law, and grandson.  we are all syn would, and enjoying the new tasks. i also pre ordered the buttons to be in the first release.  we are enjoying them and i have ordered two additional, as i know you will continue to add games to be played on them. i respect amazon for continuing to keep my original echo up to date with all new downloads."
1080,14,"the echo does what it is designed to do, and does so well. however, my home is not yet equipped with enough smart devices to justify my purchase. i bought in on the hype and, though i do not regret it i probably should have waited until it made better sense to buy it.i have found it useful to ""drop in"" on my echo from my phone. getting my daily updates is also useful. there is a feature that details your daily route that will be more useful one day. currently it allows you to input a single destination address and whenever you ask it details your route. one day i imagine you will be able to input multiple frequently-visited addresses and specify by saying ""work"" or ""church"" or ""golf course.""overall, i like the echo. it is a pretty good music player thanks to its powerful speaker. but i feel that without smart appliances it is like owning a 4k tv without the 4k content so you are still watching everything in 720p."
1081,14,"i bought this as a gift for my mother and i have to say, despite all the negative reviews, i am so happy with this! she has been wanting one for a while now and i opened it to set it up and it is too cool. it plays music perfectly, i am not all that into specifications and what not, the sound quality is amazing and it is so easy to use. will probably buy myself one soon as well!"
1082,0,"the sound is excellent, but alexa does not seem to hear or respond as well.  it just can not hear me.  the technology is amazing, and i own two of them, but it needs fine tuning.  it is a frustrating item at times.  i find myself apologizing."
1083,14,"the product description page and it is specs are misleading.  after calling echo technical support several times and asking a million questions about the unit and my music, i did buy the echo (2nd generation to listen to music, specifically my music from my itunes account.  at no time did anyone ever tell me that i would have to have an ""amazon unlimited"" music subscription (not the same as prime music) to be able to listen to my own playlists or even listen to music bought from amazon!  now, i find out that i have to keep paying and paying forever to get the most use of this product.  i also found out that amazon did support itunes playlists and purchased amazon music, but discontinued these services in favor of a ""forced"" $10/month subscription.  at $10/month, you could have a new echo every 12.5 months.  nice.  what a great way to milk loyal amazon device customers.  what a massive disappointment."
1084,14,"very disappointed!!  alexa offers very little in the way of informational resources.  i was hoping to get much more than, ""i am still learning"", when i ask a question.  i am considering returning alexa & purchasing the google device.  the sound quality is pretty good for playing music but it will not link to my tv or play songs from files on my laptop for some reason.  not worth the money & the commercials are very misleading as to what alexa has to offer.  learn faster alexa.  also, learn to speak other languages"
1085,14,"love our echo. the heather grey looks really nice. the sound is really good. of course did not really buy it for the sound, did you? you bought it for everything that it is capable of doing and it is capable of doing a lot. !5000 other reviewers can not be wrong. if you want to get the news or the weather or make phone calls then this is what you need. if you are really into music then buy a stereo."
1086,10,"wow - this thing is amazing!  i would been wondering why i would need one of these, since i do not have smart light bulbs or thermostat.  well, it does so much more than that. tells me the weather when i get up, gives me a timer for brewing my tea, plays the news, tells me jokes, tells me about the traffic. i immediately ordered another echo and a dot. i really like the play music ""everywhere"" feature."
1087,14,"this thing is amazing. favorite feature is telling it to read me self improvement audiobooks while i¡¯m waking up and eating/cleaning and what not. because that time is now more productive, i find myself cleaning my studio and eating healthy food that takes longer to prepare/eat a lot more just so i can listen to a book. only thing i¡¯d like to see is a battery that would last an hour or so so i can take it into the shower with me. other than that, a+ amazon."
1088,0,"you can set things up and it can do many things. i, however, have not used alexa to her capabilities. a book on echo for dummies might be appropriate. she is easy to use, but for you out there who are conspiracy theorists and paranoid, she is always listening. she (alexa) will pop up all of a sudden during a conversation if she thinks she has been summoned. (scary, i am already referring to her in the third person)"
1089,11,"we have a 1st generation echo, which sounds very good.  our new 2nd generation echo was just delivered.  after setting it up, we quickly realized that the sound was muffled and of noticeably lesser quality than the 1st generation version.  the sound lacks definition.  it is as if the ""treble"" level is turned all the way down.  there are no clear highs and the mid-range is not that much better.  also, recent reviews refer to a firmware update that supposedly improves the sound.  our new echo updated on its own (though i do not know to what version) but it does not sound any better.  i think this one is going back."
1090,14,"i bought this speaker for my office where wifi is scarce.  it is replacing a sonos play:1.  i was prepared for a reduction in sound quality, however, the difference was more than i imagined.  the sound quality is ok but falls way short of what sonos delivers.  the sound from the echo is nowhere near as full or powerful as what my sonos provided.the bluetooth range is lacking.  i get about 10 feet away and i start losing music.  connecting to the speaker has to initially be done through the alexa app which is annoying to say the least.when is amazon going to start including a battery in these devices to make them portable???"
1091,10,"alexa is quite amazing. sound quality great and love having her play my music choices of the moment  have not begun to utilize all her talents. got it for my 85 year old husband and he finds her to be entertaining and informative for his basic need such as what day it is. and, as per the snl alexa for seniors, remembering her name is problematic.  i ask her most things i used to google. love her."
1092,14,"with no prior experience with these types of devices, we were not sure what to expect, but it has turned out to be quite useful and entertaining.  we now are on the lookout for other ¡°smart devices¡± for use in our home.  alexa has quite a range of capabilities and she is getting smarter every day.  the response time is quite fast considering the range of inquiries <u+2014> well done, amazon!"
1093,14,"what is there to say about alexa that has not been said. well probably nothing, but here is my take. alexa is fantastic and works great on this echo. i usually use the dots but i bought this echo to give superb sound in my kitchen where i routinely listen to pandora and was not disappointed. works just at good as the dots when it comes to controlling wemo devices just has better sound."
1094,14,"have the 1st generation echo and really liked it, so my hopes / expectations were very high.  purchased over black friday weekend, so got the unit for $80.  initial sound was so-so, but had read that after the firmware update things would sound great.  i am pleased to report that was precisely my experience.  love the smaller footprint / fabric surround as it blends into the room.  highly recommend this product"
1095,11,"sound quality is superior to the echo dot but certainly not as outstanding as described. it does not fill a room with clear, crisp sound - but its not bad. we love the echo devices but if you are buying this for the superior sound quality you may be disappointed."
1096,11,"the echo 2nd generation very good upgrade, sound a lot better than 1st one , price very reasonable for look n sound. if this 1 wireless it be prefect. my sons love the 1st echo, this 2nd they not even touch it, because it not wireless. too bad i may return it later for the wireless 1.(love the sound)"
1097,10,"alexa is such fun. i received this as a birthday gift from my kids.  i am still learning how to utilize echo more and more. it is very clever, and very easy to set up and use.  i highly recommend alexa -- even when you think you would never use her -- you do."
1098,14,"love the sound that comes from this small device. i always thought there was no reason to purchase the echo, since the dot was loud enough for my small room when i wanted to listen to music. man, if i had only known the clarity and bass that came from the larger echo, i would have purchased sooner. if you want to listen to music daily, or occasionally, then you need to purchase this."
1099,11,"much better sound than the echo dot and i think a bit better than the original echo.  size is nice.  power cord sticks out the back a little, so you can not place it flush against the wall.  would be nice if there was an ""off"" button and i miss the rotating top for volume.  overall, a good solid product and probably the best echo yet."
1100,11,"i original echo sounds better.  this does sound better than a dot, but nowhere as good as the original."
1101,14,"it is a fine product but know the limitations of it. in order for this to control things, they must be bluetooth enabled. this is for the very casual user or the very capable hobbyist. people in between will feel this product is not ready for primetime as you will have to work to get it to do the things you imagined it would do. the product itself is well constructed and sounds great."
1102,14,"just another way to  milk money out of customers. sound is great but only plays songs if you subscribe to the service! ( and pay a monthly fee) for most questions you ask you get ""i do not know that"" . i guess its better than a dog ,but not much! once you establish a conversation with another person the dialog flows without a personal address . with alexa it requires that you continually preface with ""alexa""......for it to respond.  i received this one as a gift. would i buy one for $5.00 .  no!  just read an article that indicated that the unit may mess up your internet router and we have been having computer problems since we plugged it in. we are on dsl frontier and normally have some problems so not sure on that . if get the courage to unplug it  and plug it back in to test that out i will let you know . (am fearful of having to go through the set up process again!) i gave it 1 star  for its good morning greeting!!!"
1103,14,"microphone is great.  picks up my voice from further away, even when there is music or tv playing in the background.the speaker is pretty bad.  i would not recommend if you plan on using this for audio purposes.  bass response is non-existent and highs are bad."
1104,11,"this is better than then original in every way. it is smaller. it looks nicer. the wood grain makes it seem like part of the home, not just another bluetooth speaker. the warm color also goes nicely with the blue light. the unit also sounds better and clearer. and alexa seems to hear me better too. perhaps there is a better mic in the unit. i will likely be buying another for my office soon."
1105,14,"first time i have used echo. i like the ease of use and how responsive alexa is. i found it very easy to order a music service. i use the echo mostly for listening to music and while working at my desk i can change volume or music choice. had only one problem. alexa refused to talk to me one day & would not follow any commands. i tried calling her alexa and she started following directions, it seems she did not like me calling her alexis."
1106,11,i have been a fan of echo is since i received my first on.  this new 2nd generation has better sound and a plug for external speakers.  i love it!
1107,10,set up was straight forward.  we enjoy selecting and listening to music.  great sound for such a little device.  i can now get a verbal response from my outdoor weather station.  added a couple of smart receptacles to control lights.  probable will add more.  using alexa to add items to our grocery list using a separate iphone app.  our granddaughter enjoys playing games with it and hearing jokes.
1108,14,"so far, so good, i guess? i¡¯m not really sure why i got it. it is a fun little thing. still does not make me breakfast in bed, but that is okay. however, i wish the flash briefings were more customisable. i prefer different information in the morning before work than in the afternoon when i get home from work. maybe amazon is working on that? the sound quality is not as good as i expected and when using the aux output, it mutes the built-in speaker which sucks. other than that, i¡¯m not sure what else to use it for other than hands-free music and news in the morning and setting alarms and such. my review may be premature, but i¡¯ll figure out a proper use for her eventually (i hope)."
1109,10,"its fantastic! i use alexa all the time all day long - she is my alarm, my clock, my calendar, my radio, my dictionary, my news source, etc. i really do not know why i have all the other machines that i have (my phone, my ipad, my laptop - just a slight exaggeration!)! the echo is life changing and so easy to set up and use. you just get the app on your phone, follow a few instructions and you have your assistant set up and ready to go. it is truly remarkable!"
1110,14,"seems to work well.  my wife loves the grocery list feature.  only problem is my 5 year old twins boys heard her add something to the list and now our list contains items like ""butt cheeks,"" ""boob butt,"" and ""wiener""......"
1111,11,waited 'til after the update to order. am not disappointed at all! this thing is louder and has more bass than my larger jbl bluetooth speaker! this replaced my echo dot. very happy with the price and output! bought two more for my hard at hearing grandparents!
1112,14,"we have been using our echo 2nd gen for a little while now and it is quite enjoyable.  compared to our dot that we would used for much longer, the sound is better (though not unhappy with the dot).  it is a little heavy, but not too tall.... about the size of a soda can or slightly larger.  we mainly bought it to listen to music about the house.... but there are many nice features.  we would purchase again."
1113,14,i think this has the potential be a great product but you need to go in knowing what this device is capable of.music: if you do not want to pay for music you are pretty much stuck with pandora. you can still use your phone as a bluetooth device you can not play directly from the device. you also cannot upload your own music to amazon music without a subscription.knowledge: this is not a google device and the questions that you ask cannot always be answered correctly. this device is great for weather and random notifications but not great for asking questions.all in all if i could go back i think i would have purchased the google device due to the music and question aspect.
1114,14,"i do like this product. it was very fun when it was first introduced into the family. i have had it for about one month and it has lost the interest of my family members. it is rarely used unless company comes over and they ask to see what it can do. last night alexa was not responding well and kept telling me to ""try again later"". so i unplugged it and tried again. still not working properly. kind of disappointed with my purchase. but it was fun for a while."
1115,9,"love, love, love!  alexa is fun, helpful, and entertaining. we use the echo and alexa for music, recipes, answering questions, and smart home uses (turning on/off lights, heater, plugs)this echo sounds great in our bedroom, we have dots too, and love both, but this definitely has a richer sound than the dot, i use the dot in another bedroom and office and it is perfect for background music, go for the echo where you want a better music experience"
1116,11,love the new echo.  i still like the sound of the original one better in some ways.  i like base on the new echo but i do like some of the mid and high range on the original echo.  overall it sounds great.  however it still does not hear you if the volume is up too high.
1117,10,"i am having such fun with the echo. i never thought i would care for one, but received it a a gift and it is great for timers, reminders, flash briefings, answers to questions, to do list, shopping list, and it will play my audible books. we have been listening to classical music while having dinner, too. my favorite new toy."
1118,14,"alexa is the wife who does not argue, ask where you¡¯ve been all night, or whose lipstick that is on your collar. she is the best friend who does not smack their lips when they eat, or fart in the car. she is the dog who does not lick himself next to your bed all night, and does not smell like garlic boloney. she is the employee who shows up on time, stays late, and does not steal cigarette money from petty cash. she is the girlfriend who does not mess with the car stereo, put her feet on the dash, or complain about her cramps. she is the father-in-law who courtesy flushes, leaves the exhaust fan on, does not eat all of the beef jerky, or park in the garage. she is the five year old boy who does not wizz all over the shower curtain. she is the butter to your toast, gravy to your mashed taters, chocolate syrup to your ice cream, and backside to your kardashian. alexa, will you marry me?"
1119,14,"this echo is so much fun. i bought it to use as a room to room intercom paired with the echo dot. it works perfectly for that function, but it is so much more. while it took me a while to figure out the various setups, i now have that under control. i'l continue trying out additional functions. i love it for playing music, creating lists, setting reminders, asking questions, even telling jokes (albeit lame ones). still working on setting up my calendar."
1120,12,great item lots of fun lots of information unbelievable how much alexa knows great gift for anyone you will not be dissatisfied
1121,14,"i love everything about it except the lack of tone controls. the sound is punchyand sounds best loud. at lower volumes, the bass drowns out the higher frequencies(treble and midrange). an online equalizer or tone control ""skill"" would make this perfect.the sound on this thing goes through walls--you can feel the bass.a lot of sound in a small enclosure--amazing...will add star when the tone controls become available--i suspect they will.oh--some people have reported ""undocumented"" tone controls. these controlsonly alter the volume on my echo.my echo dot is envious. it is been relegated to reminders only."
1122,14,"the amazon echo is amazing.  i keep it in my kitchen and use it every day while i cook dinner.  it is incredibly helpful because in the kitchen, i usually have messy hands and can not touch anything to switch the song.  all i have to do is ask alexa to change the song or station for me!  in the morning i will often have alexa play music to get me up and energized for the day.  it changes my whole mood!i am amazed at how well the echo can understand my voice!  it almost always understands what i am asking.  the sound quality of the echo is very good as well.  i am surprised at the volume and bass that come out of this little speaker.  i would definitely recommend this speaker.  it is worth every penny!"
1123,14,"i really like the echo 2. it makes a great speaker and i am excited to find everything that i can do with it. my favorite use is the sleep sound skills, they are very relaxing and the speakers fill the whole room with sound. i am still getting used to using echo but using the echo has allowed me to cut out some of the apps on my phone with the different skills it has."
1124,14,i have only had this for a few weeks now and still getting to know all the features.  a super vast improvement over the older versions that could not answer any questions.  sound quality is good but not great ( much better than the dots).
1125,9,it is hard to imagine my life without my echo dot and my echo. i use them multiple times everyday.  the heather grey echo is beautiful and works perfectly.  it really looks like a designer piece on my nightstand. i am going to give my friend a white echo dot for her baby shower to use in her nursery.  i am sure she will love the sleep timer and the hands free ability to play a lullaby or nature noises.........
1126,14,"my first generation echo works perfectly! i bought this one for the kitchen (and moved the 1st gen to mba)--put it in the same exact location--but now i have to stand over it and yell out instructions to get it to work!! also, i will be playing ""my"" music library, or just a random station, and it just shuts off automatically after 15-20 minutes...no instructions, no power outage...just shuts off.  idk if i got a lemon or what, but it is going back! not a 2nd generation fan. :-/"
1127,14,love it! there are a few things i wish alexa understood but i am just being picky.  we do not have a smart home so we bought the tp link smart wi-fi plug to have alexa turn the lamp in our bedroom off and on.  i also tell alexa to start my day and i will receive the weather forecast for the day and the quickest route and estimated driving time to my work. i like to play deal or no deal with alexa as well.
1128,14,great sound - can be nice and loud  for those with impaired hearing . the echo dot i was given last year needed speakers for me to enjoy it . this echo ( 2nd generation )  can be adjusted to be much louder . i just hope it lasts aa long time !
1129,14,"this is fantastic and works greatusing it in a small study/office area and the sound from the unit is perfect - just right for the size of the roomjust wish there was a way to make it link to a wider ""news service"", like bbc, euro news, etc - but overall, it is great!i also love the smaller more compact size and the color choices"
1130,14,this is just the start of machines taking over the world i¡¯m pretty sure as adding to this is so addictive .. now why would i get up to turn off a light when i can have alexa do it .. pretty soon it will walk my dogs lmao .. serious fun
1131,14,love it.  purchased on behalf of a friend who saw and experienced mine.  she absolutely loved mine and the thought of being able to place orders without having to touch a computer or hear music at a whim.  alexa does so much more.  i will purchase again.
1132,11,"sounds quality is good after software update but still not like my 1st gen echos.  however, it is prettier."
1133,14,"difficult to hook up using a computer, called amazon and the tech helped me to get it to turn on but it could not connect to my wi fi without the amazon ap. found out that either you use your cell phone to get the ap or buy the amazon fire 7 tablet with alexa. i managed to download the ap with the tablet but still had to contact amazon customer support to help me hook it up to my wi fi.never could have done it without the assistance of amazon customer support and the purchase of the tablet as we do not use a cell phone."
1134,14,"when our new alexa was not as response as the first generation one and seemed a bit more buggy.  we called it the slow alexa but the initial humor has passed and now we¡¯re just frustrated with this generation of alexa.  frequently i¡¯ll have to say alexa 2-3 times, despite sitting directly in front of the unit.  when it does respond it will often go into listening mode and then immediately go back to playing music.i liked the first generation echo and was so excited for this model that i ordered it a month early and talked about it to anyone who would listen.  now i am disappointed i did not keep the packaging because i doubt that i will end up keeping it."
1135,14,love it but it does take some set up on the ipad to get the music you might want to hear.  i use amazon which has tons of free music from which you can choose. sometimes i just talk to her to see what she will say. there are sites that will give you clues on things to add and offer downloads for echo.  i¡¯m enjoying it.  voice sometimes hard to discern some words she says.
1136,14,"there is a huge learng curve with echo gen 2. spotify hooks up seemlessly.. i use it every night for sleepunfoutuatly spotify voice rec needs a lot of work.i have 2 wii fi switches for my lighting.there is a great number of skills echo has from stupid to seriousi am always learning more thingsthe buttons go on top. when you are setting it up you need to know that you are seeing an orange ring and not a red ring, if you see a red ring tap i do not see an orange ring and press the action button on top of your echo for 5 seconds and you will go into set up mode and will be all setvoice messages can only alexa to alexa and has to go to registered useri am trying to find out how i can call without a smartphone (as my mom does not have one.)i rent so my smart options are limitedi do want to be able to keep a/c off until i decide to come home, so it is nice and cool when i arrive."
1137,14,"first time user of echo and not to shabby alexa becomes a family member for ton of stuff, i hooked mine up to my bluetooth home theater so sound is great, on its own not bad but what do you expect for a small speaker.  over all great no big issues at all."
1138,9,"i love this echo there is so much you can do with it. i am using it mainly for radio stations i can only get with an app on my computer orphan. now i just play it on the echo. i got it for a great price and will order another one fore the bedroom when it goes on sale again. its super easy to set up if i could do it, anyone can. i love it, buy one."
1139,14,"love the ease of just speaking my preference and getting music and radio with great sound!  the physical footprint of this echo is minimal and i am happy that i purchased this for the express purpose of getting fuller sound for my music choices.  i also love that, though it has buttons on the top to raise or lower volume, i can just tell alexa to adjust the volume if i choose."
1140,14,"great sound from a small package, wish i would have purchased more of these instead of the dots because i find myself wanting better quality sound for music than the dot can manage without an external speaker attached.  would buy another."
1141,14,"good sound, a bit stodgy when it comes to some recognition of pronunciations, a great addition for simple conversion in recipes, would like it if the traffic skills were more comprehensive. it only allows for one route to be set, really not that useful as there are frequently multiple destinations that would be helpful to be checked on. make those improvements and the rating would easily be a 5."
1142,10,"wife loves it in bedroom for playing music...not the same quality sound as we get on our echo plus, which is our main 'alexia' contact in the living room..when you want more out of this product than just music or weather; you will have to spend some time researching all the cool stuff the 'alexia' ai can say and do...almost endless fun and uses, plus entertaining for kids and even your pets."
1143,9,"yes without a doubt this has a much better sound quality. i have the first echo,spot,show and tap  it this second generation echo has the best sound. i¡¯m definitely going to order two more of these for my other rooms. i love how you can group them all together and listen to music throughout you house."
1144,0,love it! the sound is great and it is fun to learn new skills with her. i have had a few frustrations such as not remembering wifi is at different locations like my phone and computer will do. it has also had some issues canceling alarms. the alarm will go off and mute music playing and will not recognize the command to turn off the alarm. i would give it five stars but i have had frustrations with it.
1145,14,"descriptions of the gen 2 model say improved sound and that was my biggest draw. i cant say i really hear any difference. if slightly smaller size and the interchangeable covers are important to you then go for it, but if you have a gen 1, there isnt really much advantage to upgrading."
1146,14,"still need improving when speaking to make the conversation more personal like google home, seem to be as well in form compare to my google, cortana, and my siri. also like that it has interchangeable covers. and with amazon tap charger and cradle can be use outside. con: mic sometime do not pickup as well as i would like, not sure why with 7 of them. but i believed it will continue to get better."
1147,0,alexa started out great. now when i ask it to tell me the news i get ads for online gaming. if i wanted that then i would search for it. i have not been able to get it to stop. quite annoying. almost to the point of returning alexa.
1148,10,"my wife bought me the echo for my birthday....i love it. alexa does everything from play music, tell us the weather and stock market, timing our meals in the oven to predicting the eagles will win the super bowl (which i have may have a few doubts about). it is actually a very useful tool.....next up for alexa....ordering from amazon through the echo. highly recommend...fun and helpful tool."
1149,11,"this is my 6th echo device,1-dot, 1-tap,2-1st edition and 2-2nd edition.i am running out of rooms. loli am very pleased with this purchase.the sound quality is superb and i really like that it is smaller in stature."
1150,11,i pre-ordered this for a friend because it said improve sound powered by doby and it appeared to be larger in diameter so i thought the speakers would be larger therefore better sound very disappointed in this product sound is not equal original echo.  echo first generation is an excellent product shame on you for introducing something new calling it better than the original is truly not. larry
1151,14,"oh alexa, how i love thee.  i had worked at apple, and have the entire ecosystem in place.  but i have to say, they need to step up their game with siri.  i know homepod is around the corner, but can it order me dog food?  a pizza?  for the price point, echo is also a winner. can not wait for my echo spot to arrive."
1152,10,excellent sound. so convenient! with amazon music unlimited you can literally ask alexia to play anything! i am so pleased with my purchase! you can use the app to set your location and ask what the weather is like right now and the weekly forecast.
1153,14,"i like this better than my amazon tap, sound is good although a bit on the bass side. i have bought a couple of these, compared to others on the market by other brands i liked the sound of the echo best. i can only give a 4 star because of the bass sounds being so prominent in my music. it is great for nikki minaj, but not so much for some rock or country songs. wish it had some adjustments for the tones."
1154,0,horrible!  every time i ask alexa to play music it plays songs  with totally explicit lyrics and it is not only offensive to myself and my children but embarrassing when guests are at the house.  no matter how i try to repharase her playing music without explicit lyrics she either says i do not understand or.....so you want me to play explicit music?  i end up cursing at the stupid thing worse then the lyrics!  so annoying and stressful!
1155,0,"app on i phone does not work, cannot delete it, information on amazon does nothing....frustrated"
1156,14,"unless you have smart appliances or thermostat or a tv that is compatible with the device it really is silly because it does very little can remind you to do things call people if it is hooked to your phone otherwise it is not very good reference for the internet, it cannot distinguish between a simple word like oregon state versus organ in the human body.  just a novelty for now, even playing music, unless you have a subscription for the music service it is quite limited"
1157,14,"after being super active, i have had to stay home most of the time due to chronic back pain. i love ordering alexa around to fill my home with music. the small speakers are much better than i would have expected. i got the trial for the extended list of music. it is worth the $3.99 a month. when playing a ""shuffle"" of songs by an artist, you can tell alexa to skip if you do not care for one."
1158,14,"after 2 plus hours of excellent customer service from amazon to get it to work properly, it quit about 3 hours later.  now i have to hold a button to make sure it is listening.fairly sure that is not the point of the device."
1159,14,"i held out for a long time before getting one of these, but now that i have one greatly enjoying it.  it is pretty cool to be able to tell alexa to play bob marley, and she fills your living room with great sounds.  i just have amazon prime music and no other services, but so far i have found a great deal of good music on that.  also like the alexa, add to list and add to to do list functions."
1160,10,i really was hesitant in buying echo as i really saw it asa bit frivolous. but i love echo and alexa!!!! she is a wealth of information .... and i get to access all the music i like right away! no searching for me !!! also so much more information i can get right away as i plan my day. !! i really can not imagine my day without alexa. ... well i can be you get what i am saying ...this echo is awesome.!!!
1161,14,"great product for hands-free music, weather, recipes--but i especially appreciate the ability to communicate with my disabled relative.  thanks to drop in, we can have instant conversations without her having to do a thing--she just starts speaking when i say ""hello""!  she can ask alexa what day it is, what the weather is, what her calendar holds--as many times as she likes. great product for elderly/disabled consumers.  could be improved for that population with higher volume, slower speech."
1162,11,the echo works great for a living room or kitchen area. the sound is good if you do not put the volume up too high. the bass is distorted after volume 9. i prefer to use my bluetooth bose speaker for music that i want louder. overall good spread of sound for everyday listening.
1163,11,"going from an echo dot to echo i was not expecting the much deeper sound, and bass. took a little getting use to over the dot but sound is good for music and nature sounds, sometimes it is harder to understand alexa due to the bass but it may just be me adjusting to the depth of the sound. easy setup like the dot. nice weight wheralexae it would be knocked over easily."
1164,14,is not compatible with my phone. was on the phone with customer service for almost 2 hours to resolve the issue and in the end of it all they had to submit a ticket. they told me they would get back to me within a few days. well it is been well over two weeks now. i was able to link up to my home network just not my mobile phone...which i personally need it to link with my phone because i always travel. another thing i dont like is you have to program and ask for the direct website to find out information. with google you can ask a question and it will pull up its own source of information.
1165,14,"the sandstone fabric is perfect for a light colored room! adds texture and i do not mind the black cable since it is up next to my black tv on the mantle.i had been going back and forth between getting a full echo or a dot. my main use initially is for music so i decided on an echo for my living room, and ended up getting a dot for the bedroom since they were on such a great deal when you buy both. the speakers are definitely different! the echo has great base and depth (especially compared to my normal tv speaker), where the dot sounds super shallow. that is fine for certain uses but if you want to hear quality music, go with the echo (not the dot)."
1166,14,"a great sounding desktop speaker.  alexa seems to understand my voice better than siri.however, when the echo 2 is connected to my apple mac mini via bluetooth, the sound is not as loud and it sometimes crackles and sounds sluggish.  i have found two workarounds to resolve the crackling.  first, unplug the echo and plug it back in.  second, under apple > system preferences > bluetooth, delete echo and then reconnect it.in a future alexa / echo 2 update, i would like to be able to ask back-to-back questions after one ""alexa"" waking.  after alexa answers a question, echo / alexa should give a person at least one second to ask another question before going back to sleep."
1167,14,"i am truly enjoying  it a lot. it is what i expected out of the echo. my grandkids are having a blast because now they can ask alexa to tell them a ""joke"" after a joke. i am having fun because i can listen to my music thats when my young grand daughter is not asking her to play her music so she can dance for us. i like very much that i went to buy another one for my personal use and put it on my bedroom. now, my three sons bought their own and they are using it to help them with their home-work. it is a lot easier for them to do their home-work.thank you ""alexa"" you have made me happy. now i am working in controlling  all of my equipment with ""alexa"""
1168,14,"another female in the house--yay!  i am still getting used to what alexa can do (she has not been able to sync with my smart tv for some reason because i refuse to purchase any ""auxiliary"" apps to make it happen), but other than her inability to understand my diction (she no speak da boston), she is okay.  used mostly for creating shopping lists or amazon purchases (which is why they created her, right?).  i do like the heather gray fabric...i got the prettiest alexa they make."
1169,14,"happy with my purchase is an understatement. the 2nd gen echo is great. the new speaker packs a real punch for such a small device. the volume can be raised to a very respectable level, and alexa is functionality is only going to increase as time goes on. i will say, there was a bit of any issue with setup. specifically with connecting to wifi. i am a college student that lives on campus and takes advantage of the free wifi offered to students. there is a capture web browser page that students are redirected to in order to provide login credentials. when trying to load this page via the alexa app (on ios) the app would give an error instead of displaying the page. thankfully, i was able to work around the issue by having the devices mac added directly to the network. hopefully a fix is found for the issue soon. other than that, love the product."
1170,14,i¡¯ve had my echo for about 2 months now and have even purchased an echo dot as well. it really generates great sound quality and responds well even when you whisper to it. i¡¯ve have had other smart home devices for a while and not only was this a great addition to the lineup but it paired right up with my phillips hue lights.i highly recommend this product.note: reason i am giving 4 stars and not 5 is that there is sometimes a misunderstanding when you ask it to do the same tasks with different verbage
1171,0,fun...the speaker sounds way better than expected.  now part of the family even though it may be spying on us.  we love it.
1172,14,the bass is not good. it was a good product at $79 but not at $100. i would never in a million years purchase this thing for the current price. wait until it goes back down. i think that the original one had much better sound.
1173,0,"i love the idea of alexa. asking her simple questions like the weather stuff works out fine. she struggles to understand us when we are in the skills section playing games so we get a lot of the answers wrong which is frustrating, trying to get her to play certain songs with non explicit lyrics is a big issue as well.  simple commands she does not understand :asking for duets or asking playlist to be stored is also an issue."
1174,14,"great side kick for listening to your favorite music, getting a morning news briefing, or asking for basic facts. i have to google things a lot less now. i am sure i have only scratched the surface of the echo is capabilities and it will take a while to realize its true potential. i did notice that artificial intelligence has only gotten so far, as you can not ask complicated questions to alexa."
1175,11,this thing sounds like a high end bose speaker i also own.  even if you do not want the alexa business .... get it for the bluetooth speaker capability !  room filling sound ... and a fraction of the price for a bose !
1176,14,amazon unlimited $4 per month for device works well or twice price for multiple devices on one account or 15 for family plan with 6 devices.  spotify works well too with same prices as amazon unlimited except $4 device only option is not offered with spotify at this time.  commect to iphone and android well.  bluetooth or can connect by 3.5mm wire to other speakers. sethkolodny.com
1177,14,"i have 1 original echo, 1 dot and 3 new echos ... love them all but this ¡°ok¡± is getting annoying. especially the kitchen dot connected to my nose speaker. i have 45 controllable devices and she screams ¡°ok¡± after every successful task like ¡°look i did it !!!¡± i¡¯m ordering a google home and see if it can quietly preform task."
1178,14,the sound on this device is outstanding and rich. i love how it can play multi room music now that i have 2 echoes.
1179,14,"this device is fascinating.  i love it.  however, i have one insurmountable challenge with it.  i live in the country and must use satellite internet.  as a result, in my first month with this device, i used up my data allotment in less than 20 days.  i do not want to spend any more money on internet coverage, so i seem destined to use only a fraction of this device is capabilities/"
1180,10,"i am having so much fun with this.  while working on my computer i ask it to play music for me, it plays whatever type i wish.  i also, when needing to spell a new word, elexa tells me how..  she gives us the weather each morning, even the news if we ask.  she will even play games with us.i think everyone should have one of these.  we now have one in the den and one in the living area."
1181,12,i am very satisfied with this new echo! sound is crisp and clear. it is pretty easy to setup with the amazon alexa app and i am still learning a lot about it. definitely worth every cent!
1182,10,"oooh the best speaker i have ever brought. alexa is a favorite in my home. my kids (ages2-10)love playing rock paper scissors with her. when ever they say they are bored i just tell them to talk to alexa. they will ask her to tell them jokes, sing, or even ask her a questions like how far is earth from the moon. she will come back with a paragraph for an answer and from there the conversation continues."
1183,14,"i am writing a 5 star review for our amazon echo because it has actually changed my moms quality of life. she has ms, and is bed bound: unable to do simple tasks like pick up her tv remote or call her friends and family. since receiving this for christmas, my mom has gained independence once again. she uses alexa to play games, to change tv channels through dish network, and even make phone calls. she can order snacks off amazon, make notes to remind us for medical supplies and appointments, turn on and off her lamp, and even more things she has not had the capability of doing for years.thanks amazon, and every other company, who puts out products for the general public that do more for them than they intended. you have given my disabled mother a little more independence and freedom. and as her caregiver, i am grateful for this product for making my job easier. best present ever."
1184,11,"easy to set up and works great.  i do not think the sound is quite as good as the echo plus, but very close.  the echo 2nd gen has more microphones listening so it is much more responsive than the echo plus.  if you have music turned up loud on the echo plus many times it can not hear you when ask for something or give a command.  the echo 2nd gen seems to be much better in this area.  even with the music at full volume it will still hear you and respond. purchased one for each of my sons."
1185,14,"amazon echo, while providing right at my expectations, has provided me with a lovely addition to my office. while allowing me to remember trivial or small things like, a timer for my oven, or a reminder to check on the dog outside, allows me not to have to worry about the small stuff. echo is also a much better speaker than i would have imagined. while providing brains, and functionality, amazon has impressed me to say the least. as far as cons? probably additional functionality, like being able to send and receive messages through sms, play my voicemail, or things as simple as that. given that it is a new and emerging technology field though, and given it will eventually be implemented, i can not really deducted this small flaw from the overall experience. truly a wonderful piece of technology."
1186,14,"nice product. very unobtrusive design, disappears in its surroundings. i do not use it anywhere near its potential and my wife absolutely refuses to use it. i use it most for simple requests like ""what time is it"" or turning on a few smartthings controlled lights, or playing ""background, white noise"" sounds. audio quality is adequate unless you are a serious music person."
1187,14,sound showed up with a firmware update.bought this as a gift and was anticipating better sound. love the features but not the sound. i have it hooked to the home audio to make it tolerable but i could have done that with a dot.
1188,14,"alexa is just a lot of fun. she takes a bit of getting to use. when jimmy fallon was showing alexa video (i do not have the video, just the tower) on tv he asked alexa to play japanese water music. when the skit was over, my husband and i heard strange noises coming from the kitchen. we were in the bedroom. we went out to the kitchen and alexa was playing the same music. she must of heard her name... scary. we love her!"
1189,14,"th bass on this echo is super good. at first alexa lagged with responding but that could have been my internet or something.the set up was super easy. we have an echo and a first gen echo and they all work great around the hosue.it is waaaaaay louder than google voice. my wife is parents have a google voice and we compared with this echo, blew the google home out of the water!"
1190,14,"speakers are great, but it has a hard time staying connected to wireless. i have tried everything and followed all of amazon is recommendations to solve the wireless connectivity issues. it still cuts out all the time.i have it on a 5ghz wireless signal, and nothing else on that channel. my wireless router is new and higher speed than i need. there are no other competing devices in the room. charter is my internet service and it is wicked fast. so, i am not sure what the issue is.my mother. has the first-gen echo and it works like a dream."
1191,14,very good sound for such a small unit.in larger rooms buy 2 and get a nice sound in the room for music. no they do not go into stereo mode but with 2 it adds to the fullness of sound in larger rooms. just name them both different names so they both do not answer you at once.  also use the app to set up a play music everywhere/sync with the 2 units when you ask it to.
1192,14,"the sound quality is much better than i would have expected.  i have got to say, this thing is everything i hoped it was.  ask it what movies are playing, to play you a certain song, or to turn on the lights in the kitchen (with some additional products set up)--and it does it!  so awesome.the only issue is that sometimes alexa will not understand you.  it will make you furious and you will scream at alexa.  but she can take it."
1193,11,amazon said the sound quality was better! so i thought i would upgrade. the 1st generation sounds better. back to using the old echo.
1194,14,"being an alexa fan, the new echo 2 has all the features we already enjoy. amazon is claim that this unit produces ""improved sounds"", however, is a gross exaggeration. it sounds better than a dot.. i will give it that. as of now the best sounding echo remains the tap."
1195,14,"great sound, needs to be compatible with google play music rather than just with amazon music. works for blue tooth but would be excellent if telling alexa to play a certain song by a certain band with google play music would be great and i would give a 5 star review. if you mainly want a music platform get the google home. does the same thing as alexa but you can use google play music on more than just one device"
1196,10,we got this as a christmas gift and we are still learning how to use it.  what i mean is what types of information can be retrieved from alexis.  so far it is great for the weather info and giving me the time in far away time zones.  it also gives current news information and is a great way to play all of the music in my amazon account.  it also does a good job of playing my audible books.
1197,14,"sooooooo cool. amazing life changer--and so much fun--seriously!get help if you hit a snag. then--get an amazon echo connect--then go straight to heaven!amazon rocks and it is the only way to buy--shop! ***24/7--tech support will walk you through!***amazon--where have you been all of our lives! amazon/ (mr jb), rules, and this is the only way to shop!"
1198,11,this little echo 2nd generation looks really good and sounds amazing. i am very happy. i would buy again. amazon great job like always keep up the amazing work. i listened to music all day and boy this goes all day up all the way with no problems. i love it.
1199,14,"i honestly did not see what all the hype was about the echo. then i played with the one my sister in law had. now i own an echo. i am amazed by the sound quality that this little speaker puts out. alexa has no problem recognizing voices. my whole family has been having a great time using this! our favorite thing is to have alexa play ""rock paper scissors lizard spock""."
1200,10,bought this for my wife for christmas. she loves it. said it is the best present she could get. alexia is fun to interact with and reminds us to do things we for get to do like take medicine at a certain time.  when you get older you sometimes forget. she plays pandora for us  and what we are doing now is just the tip of the iceberg as what she can do. she does have a personality the more you use her. love it love it love it  john and deb thomas
1201,14,"had the previous version, usb port came out. got this one and surprised it does not have a port. disappointed by that."
1202,14,love it love it  love it love itonly negative is the whole produc set i did not put in is rating because it has nothing to do with this actual machine always with any of these product set it is more like talking to the ineptness of apple is siri than the android google voice search product. a better search engine better be created and search skill or this product set will having people shortly moving to the google products as soon as their integration goes live. the voice training has not helped and misunderstanding of even i am searching for leads me back to finding my phone searching google. and it was a huge feature marketed that is supposed to be its main baseline and selling point!!!! and how many skills i have to add is overwhelming even to the point of remembering for each information point you what you have to say open them
1203,14,"i do not know if it is just me... but alexa can not answer 90% of the most simple questions i ask her. example: what can help ease nausea symptoms? alexa: hmm i do not know that one.but then if i ask her why the sky is blue, she goes into depth describing the molecules and everything else that makes it blue. basically she only knows useless information besides knowing the weather. she can only find the songs i request on spotify half of the time.. or she¡¯ll find it and an hour later she says she can not. amazon music does not have most of the songs i request either. she also can not hear me a lot of the times or she will start to answer a question before i¡¯m done talking.she is more frustrating than useful.however, the sound quality is amazing. would be a great speaker if she could find any of the music i ask her to play."
1204,11,i have both 1st (tall) and 2nd (short) echo. the 1st gen has way better sound. maybe that is why 2nd gen is cheaper.
1205,14,"i was skeptical at first but asked for the smaller echo for christmas. after setting it up and finding all it could do, i moved that one to the bedroom and ordered this for the main living area. they are much more useful on a day to day basis than i had ever imagined. especially like being able to do voice control for home automation devices. also nice to wakeup and ask alexa for the weather and what is on my calendar for the day!"
1206,10,my husband loves his. the sound is great and with prime unlimited music you can listen to anything you want. our son loves to ask alexa for jokes. i like using the timer in the kitchen. i know there are a lot more features we have not even explored yet.
1207,14,"not really recommended, it is not recognizing my voice and some of the features are not working as i thought they would. the speaker is not worth the price difference over the echo dot. i am returning it for the dot. i was disappointed"
1208,10,"we love alexa.  i have it in the kitchen, and it is so handy just having her add things to my grocery list as i discover i am running low or need something in the coming days for a recipe.  many uses we are still discovering.  :)"
1209,0,"i am still trying to figure out everything alexa can do, without me having a ""smart phone"".  i really enjoy listening to the ocean and other sounds of nature. i ask a lot of questions that alexa does not know and if i ask alexa to play a song, she will not play it unless it is in my music library on amazon. i am waiting to learn more about alexa in the future."
1210,10,"works great for amusement.  purchased for amusement and for help if i fall.  hav not had to try that out as yet.  i have a dot in the bathroom and intend to get another one for the bedroom.my granddaughter got one from ""santa"" and we had lots of fun with it.i hope this works so i do not need to get one of those annoying things you need to hang around your neck."
1211,14,"the echo is amazing.  first of all, it is a terrific bluetooth speaker.  the sound easily fills my medium size living room.  it has an audio output plug, so i can play it thru my stereo if i want to.  then there is the idea of having a companion who can answer questions, schedule my appointments, add items to my shopping list, etc.  i am sure alexa has many ""skills"" that i have not discovered or mastered yet.  i am very excited to have an echo in the house!"
1212,0,"love the voice and basic abilities and also know that amazon is coordinating additional features but as for tying it all together and or asking ""alexa"" a question... barely better than siri.be prepared to spend a great deal of time in setting up and ""learning"" what alexa can do and not do.simplicity is key and for the lack of current features, i subtract 1 star."
1213,14,works and sounds great. very easy to setup and works as described. highly recommended. other reviewers that had sound quality issues i¡¯m guessing was fixed with latest update like they said it would be so would not worry about that issue if your looking to purchase.
1214,11,looks nice but the audio is much worse than original or even tap. very disappointing.
1215,0,"sometimes, alexa talks without being spoken to. we are still trying to get the hang of it. alexa can do a lot of things but she does not offer anything that you cannot live without. in my opinion, she is overrated and over priced. we mostly use her to play music which can be achieved with a portable bluetooth speaker for much cheaper. worth the hype? not really."
1216,14,"i bought this to replace the echo dot i was using on the main floor of my house. it was not loud enough on its own and the bluetooth connection with my tv soundbar was flaky. sounds fine for my purposes. i listen to a lot of radio and podcasts. i streamed some music from my phone and its was ok for that as well -- but no $99 speaker playing compressed audio is going to sound like a concert hall. my only concern was that it kept losing connection to my wi-fi network the first time i connected it. i removed it an re-installed and it is working fine now. i have it since monday -- got it a day early, so props to amazon for that!"
1217,14,"alexa is a lot of fun to have around.  honestly it is still early in use to fully have utilised all of the great features.  having that knowledge available when you are in need of quick information is always useful.  someone will bring something up or you may hear something you do not know about and it is as easy as ask alexa.  also  many of today is electronica can be aided by alexa if you choose to have it so, making it much easier to use.  soon you will wonder what you did before she was around to help.  new skills added are a bonus. it seems like alexa will continue to grow in the future and that is a great investment.our family loves it."
1218,14,great sound! thought my unit would be some what independent of my roommates unit. not so. have registered units several times with little success. each time to old names we registered under was still there. could not drop in without problems of a contact being added to both units or their friend coming in on me. support was not helpful in clearing problems. then we decided to add me to roommate is amazon prime account... that is when we were told by support everything pretty much would be shared.  drop in is out due to never know which unit will receive it. even stopped drop in to each other... unit would say the other one was busy. yelling back and forth works better.the last two weeks my unit plays music  and stops after about 10 minutes.bought three units as gifts for christmas. would do it again. just wish i had known the problems in a single household! and removing both on prime account does not help.
1219,14,"purchased this mainly for my wife who has vision problems. being able to contact me buy simply saying ""alexa call mike"" or ""alexa what time is it"" makes life much easier for her. when she was in rehab i could check up on her with the ""drop in"" feature. the sound quality is fine for a speaker this small and the system has a ton of potential."
1220,11,"what a great speaker! we have the original, the dot,  and now two 2nd generation ones. i love the sound of these. they fill the entire house with music. the fabric looks awesome and matches our couches. i could not be more pleased."
1221,11,"my 4th alexa device, first echo. the sound is pretty impressive at lower volumes. anything over 6, the bass falls off and it gets tinny. my bose mini 2 running off an echo dot sounds better, but this is more convenient."
1222,14,awesome technology!  alexa had many skills but i am most impressed with her ability to integrate into my adt pulse system which is adt is smart home platform.  i am able to tell alexa to turn lights in and off and arm and disarm the system.  this is just an example of many skills she has and all she can do. on the down side she is not always able to perform the skill the first time.  you have to ask her the same thing 3 and 4 times in a row before it works.  that is frustrating.  she has learned my voice so that is not the issue.  overall this is very cool.  hopefully in time the software will update and get a little better at recognizing things the first time.
1223,14,"echo is a lot of fun for the money. it is instant and informative and humorous at times. one thing to know: alexa got a little screwy once. could not answer questions. i googled and could not find a solution. i reset the modem with no success. but when i unplugged the echo for a minute and restarted it, it was fine. it is like powering down your phone or ipad from time to time."
1224,14,"i bought these as gifts for christmas but ended up taking one for myself.  i do not know why someone would need to use a hub as this system seems to be usable with other devices.  i especially enjoy telling it to play music, different music types, different singers and well, i have not yet discovered all that it is capable of doing. easy to setup and use."
1225,14,here to balance out the reviews. i have had the original and a echo dot. i have read people were complaining about the audio quality and from what i have read amazon pushed out an update and the quality is great for a 100 dollar speaker and you get alexa.
1226,1,"nice size, good quality"
1227,14,"while the speaker quality is not good enough for the living room for me, it works well in a bedroom. i am deep into apple is ecosystem, but eventually went over this over the home pod and really happy. yeah the home pod might sound much better, but i mainly wanted a smart home speaker and this does the job, and plays music for a bedroom or small room very well!"
1228,14,"excellent piece of technology!  customer service is easy to contact and available 24/7 which is a major plus!  the speaker is outstanding in every way mentionable. it is not a portable speaker, although you can buy chargable battery packs for it to easily turn it to a portable device.  the only portable alexa is ¡®alexa tap¡¯. tap has a bigger bass sound as for echo having a clearer crisper sound. both are great products, i own both and am 100% satisfied with them!"
1229,11,"not a huge upgrade over the dot, but enough of an increase to justify the purchase. the style we got was very nice (grey fabric), and definitely gives it a higher class look. the convenience of this little guy will beat the quality of a bigger sounds system for me 10 times out of 10. just being able to issue a short command is great."
1230,14,"nice looking exterior -  i like the bluetooth capability -  the sound quality does not seem to be improved over the original echo i have -- i most definitely  do not like the change on top of the unit - the original with the rotating volume control is much easy to operate, especially if you are in a hurry to adjust - its not easy to find the correct buttons for volume up/down unless you are looking directly at it and harder at night.  i also thought that this model was supposed to be more responsive to the alexa command if the volume was turned up loud.... have not seen much improvement there.overall, i love the echo product, i just think my original was a better more usable unit and has great sound.  i heard there may be a software update that can cause better sound, just not sure how to know if its been updated."
1231,14,"pro-alexa knows a lot. con-alexa does not know a lot until you program that skill you want.  for example when first asking for current wind speed alexa would answer she did not know. you must go into the alexa app and select one of the many wind speed ""skills"".  once you enabled the skill she can tell you.  their is a lot she knows out of the box so do not let her fool you.  reminders the timmer and shopping list are the things alexa does everyday.  even when i am away from the device a reminder will notify me on my phone.  we use the timmer every night while cooking.  you can ask her when the next newest episode will air of your favorite show.  i think we will keep her if not add to our smart devices in the home."
1232,10,love this!!!  had lots of fun with it initially asking questions.  one of my favorites now is asking alexa to play praise and worship music when i first get up.  starts my day out with a thankful heart and love for my creator as i make breakfast and get ready for the day. as i leave the house i say stop.  i do not have to go over and turn some button off before i grab my coat and purse. i know we¡¯re so lazy are not we?  wow!  so happy for a great product.
1233,14,this new echo generation 2 has difficulty responding to commands. it does not hear it is wake up word very well and it has to be repeated several times. at other times it starts talking when i have not asked anything of it at all. it took my original echo awhile to recognize the wake up word and my voice but this one still has not gotten it down yet. i have had it for over a month.
1234,0,still trying to figure her out. with trivia she does alot of the same.  i thought she would remember stations etc. but still have to tell her the same shit. might be my fault. also i guess i am too polite so do not say please or thank you. ugggh.  like her though still learning. also she tells me to go to my account and i there is not a way to do what she says.  ugggh.
1235,14,"i really love my echo gen 2.  alexa is used everyday to provide us with music, manage the complete lighting arrangement of our living room and dining room.  i,ve purchased alexa capable smart bulbs as well as smart outlets.  i¡¯ve also synced alexa to my iphone, so i can send and receive calls just by speaking commands to the echo ii.  next i want to set up the two alexa dots that i purchased.  i¡¯m having a blast converting my home to a smart house."
1236,14,"i love my echo! i have the second generation. it was easy to set up. i also subscribe to amazon unlimited music which makes it extra nice because it has everything! it can play entire albums or what i like is folk 70s music just ask it. i have listend to smooth jazz to classic rock you name it! i might ask whats the weather or ask it a question but for the most part i just got it for the music. it sound good its not a bose so its not that quality but its good to relax to or  clean the house or if you have company just ask it to play something specific or say alexa play classic 70 rock and it gives you diiferent artist. and of core its hands free, also its very responsive to your voice. i am very happy with it"
1237,14,"love using alexa, this echo the bigger and i thought would be better device than the echo dot has a much slower response time, have not tried rebooting yet so maybe that will help!  anyway i love the alexa app!!  however it have found that siri is working as well as alexa, but siri can not contro lights, home security or other devices on my home!!  so alexa is the winner!!!!"
1238,11,"bought two, one for the bedroom and one for the living room. the sounds is great for the bedroom, ok for the living room but not great. the biggest problem i have with them is it seams that it does hear the activation word as well as the smaller echos of which i have three. we are always saying the name twice because there is no response on the first try."
1239,14,"save yourself the headaches and get a google home.the best part about the echo is the line out port. everything else is meh. search results are poor. when you ask it to play something from spotify, 90% of the time it is wrong, or can not find what you are asking.even with learned skills, my results are hit and miss... mostly miss.you can not stream from spotify on your iphone to echo in the spotify app the way you can to google home which is a huge pain. you have to use the alexa app, which again, usually does not work.the audio quality is meh as well. thankfully an audio out port is on the back, so you can plug it into another set of speakers.the best thing about echo is that my son can send voice notes to my parents whenever he wants, and that is enough reason to keep it around. at least it looks good on my dresser!"
1240,14,"while alexa has become a member of the family living in two rooms of the house, she is not yet as smart as she could be. the skills are limited. jeopardy only allows 6 questions. she is not sure about any famous black women. i would like to be able to ask a follow up, but there is no recollection. i wish i could use her as an intercom between the two. while she answers the basics, like time and weather forecasts, she does not know specifics and i need to research on my own. decent for playing music, but i would like to transfer my itunes library to amazon so she can play specific songs i ask for. if i did not get a bloomingdale is gift card (i do not shop there very much), i do not know if i would keep her - until she gets more ways to provide information."
1241,14,"i think the sound is very good! placed in a central location i can hear music all through my house...i love it! how times change. now you do not need to have a stereo system and a gigantic library of cd is! all you need is the echo and amazon prime music! we have asked some questions that alexa has no answer for, but i think she and i will keep learning as time goes on. i like that the wake word does not put every device in the house on alert as would be the case with ""ok google""."
1242,10,"my son and daughter-in-law purchased this for me as a christmas present.  the learning curve was not bad, and my wife and i find we are using it on a daily basis.  we use it to tell us the time, the weather first thing in the morning, to play music on, and even have our grocery list on it, which we read on our i-phones at the grocery store.  this was the very best gift we received for christmas!!"
1243,10,"i love my echo¡¦ and there are new things coming out every day that she can do...games, weather, timer, music, radio, and dozens more¡¦what more could you want!!???¡¦ i especially love being able to put a grocery list on my iphone......so incredibly handy because i was always forgetting my grocery list when i went to the store and now i¡¯ve got it with me on my phone.........i love amazon!"
1244,11,"i thought the speaker would be better than the original one, but it actually is not better. and, i like the volume control on the original one better too. otherwise, the small size and fabric cover i sleeker looking and more decretive."
1245,10,"christmas gift for my family. i already own one and use it nearly every day.  we initially only used the echo for ""rain sounds"" when we had trouble falling asleep. now, we use her daily for music, weather, current news, its great!"
1246,9,i bought this for my front office since my office manager likes to listen to music during the day and thought it might help her with a few simple tasks while working....best plan ever! it is the hit in the office!
1247,0,"later i might rate it a 5 star, but the learning curve that we are going through makes it only a 4.  what we say must be exactly what alexa has learned to recognize.  she does not recognize words or phrases that are only similar.  i wish she were a little more trainable as as the voice in our phones.  so the learning curve is for us and we are slowly getting there."
1248,11,"the great: the sound from the music is a big improvement from the echo dot, drop in feature from the echo to the echo dot is great.the good: the added microphones pick up your commands betterthe bad: the speaker for the alexa voice is much worse than the echo dot, it is very difficult to understand and hear the new alexa. if you crank the volume to compensate, then the music is way, way too loud.maybe the super echo solves this problem ?"
1249,14,"this puts out pretty great music quality. it sounds good and is quite loud! it is very easy for me to set my alarms for work, also. i bought this model for myself and 2 dots for my kids. the dots are not as loud.the only con is that it will not work if you unplug it.i plan to buy at least 1 more echo in this size for my home and have already purchased some smart hubs so that i can control lamps using voice and my alexa."
1250,14,"the feeling of independence that alexa  gives me is what i like best.i will keep my background to myself,  but to any person who depends mainly on they are voice this is a great product.there are problems with every new product.  so far,  the most difficult issue i am dealing with is setting up my phone adapter.i am sure over time i will figure out how.  one more problem exists that is quite frustrating..why can not you play double jeopardy and other skills by using an amazon gift card.if you can truly cancel the skill at any time, why am i not able to use an amazon gift card for an amazon product .to sum up, best invention i have ever gotten access to .  company logic and joint promotion  not so good."
1251,14,"my son got me this for christmas, but because i had two internet settings, it took a bit of time to connect it. i decided to put on a beatles medley, and was surprised how many songs i could sing, and started bopping around the kitchen. i love it. i listened to npr today, and just found out i can use my sirus with it, too. i will give that a try tomorrow."
1252,10,"we love our new friend alexa. we bought her mainly to play music and were surprised at the great sound quality. since we are both in our seventies, we ask her to play a lot of really old selections and we are amazed at the wide selection as well as the rich sound of even the ones made back when recording was pretty simplistic..the speed with which she comes back with answers to even the most far-out questions never ceases to amaze us. we feel like we have a new friend in the house."
1253,11,"the newest generation of amazon echo is okay as far as i can tell. i would not go as far as saying the sound quality has been ""improved"" however. it is just ok and sounds slightly muffled. but overall a good product, gets the job done and responds just as well as the previous generation of amazon echo. have not had any real technical issues with it yet but i would still take the first generation over this one."
1254,14,"i love this new toy! i did not buy it for personal use, but for my business to help with finding information quicker. it still needs fine tuning to find local addresses, but its sound is unbelievable and the alexa software is easy to use! please buy you will love it!"
1255,11,"good looking unit. the speaker is solid for music, but will not blow you away. i adore alexa."
1256,0,"it is a great ""gadget"" even for those who are not tech savvy.  great speaker sound.  the only drawback is that i do not entirely know what it can or cannot access.  i have more access to features now that i have amazon prime.  i would recommend it to everyone who wants a news, weather, info and entertainment source, but i think it would be helpful to get a tutorial from someone you know who is well versed in what it can do."
1257,14,"an attractive upgrade for the original echo. the v2 sound might be slightly better, but i was already happy with v1 sound. since i have my two units in different rooms with different acoustics, i can not claim to have made a fair comparison. regarding other echo skills that i have enabled, particularly control of my many smart home devices, v1 and v2 behave identically."
1258,14,"i got the echo as a birthday gift from my sister and i have to say it is one of the best gifts i have ever had. not only is the echo abundant in app add-ons  (it has a little something for everyone) but it is overall look and multi purpose skills are the best out there. the volume level is perfect and the echo can be heard all around the house at its loudest. the voice detection range on the echo is also unbeatable, i can be three rooms over and still alexa can pick up my requests with no problem at all. overall this is a great product and i highly recommend getting your self one :)"
1259,14,"i purchased the echo on a impulse not knowing why i would use it. well i now know why, it is great. i am still learning all of its features but the ones i use work well. it plays my music on demand and the sound is fabulous, i do not know how such great sound can come from such a small device. i also purchased smart devices for it however have not connected with them yet. it finds programs on my fios and saves me time manually searching for them. i am hooked and recommend it highly."
1260,14,love this! the volume is way louder then the dot. i was disappointed in the dot but the echo is awesome. i use it (which you can use the dot for too) to set reminders for me for my work deadlines and since i also have amazon prime it is hooked up to my music so i can hear my playlists while i work. i use it everyday and do not have a bad thing to say about it.
1261,14,"the only thing i do not like is that the 2nd gen does not come with a volume control ring but with buttons instead. it was a gift for my mom, and she does not mind the buttons (you can also control volume with voice)"
1262,10,"love learning all the ways echo has made simple ordinary tasks even easier.  echo was easy to set up and is very user friendly.  i wanted it thinking it would be most helpful to my physically disabled husband and to my surprise it has been just as useful to me.  timers, alarms, weather, music reminders, calendar keeper, we are still discovering new uses.  best christmas gift to ourselves!"
1263,9,this is my second alexa-one echo and my son gave me a dot for christmas.  i am almost 80 and cannot believe all the wonderfulinventions and new products in my lifetime.  i especially like the music unlimited and the wonderful sounds that can put you to sleep.there is not anything that i do not like about it.  alexa is our future and i hope everyone gets the chance to enjoy it.
1264,14,"audio quality is far superior to dot, but echo2 needs to visit an audiologist.  perhaps more moody than alexa bedroom and alexa florida room... possibly bored with inane queries.  maybe just not as smart.  no question her hearing is not nearly as acute."
1265,10,"i really love alexa.  she keeps my shopping list  efficiently on my phone.  she greets me with interesting facts each morning and a joke and the weather if i ask.  she sounds great when i ask her to play my favorite station.  there are a lot of things she does that i do not even know yet....however, every once in awhile i am denied  because i do not have amazon prime......"
1266,14,i am so happy that music sounds great on this echo. my husband has the little disc shaped echo and i was disappointed listening to music. i changed the name from alexa to amazon because it was easier to remember. you need to use certain phrases when asking for something. the amazon help staff answered my questions. i love listening to siriusxm and pandora.
1267,14,we have an echo dot one and though useful for checking time listening to music and checking temperature outside the speaker just was not loud enough. so naturally we bought this because it was on sale for black friday and we love it.
1268,14,"i went for the ""buy 2 get a third for $50"" deal.  two of them have similar mac addresses (fc:a1:83:*) and work great!  the third has a very different mac address (6c:56:97:*) and has to be unplugged to reset at least once a day, or it says it is having trouble understanding.  i thought it might be a wall blocking the wifi, so i swapped it with the office one that was not having problems, and the problem followed.  i am assuming it is a refurb or something.  rather disappointing..."
1269,14,"i love the way alexa responds even when there is loud noise in the room, the jokes i could live without, but they are pretty funny. i tell her te play xm radio channel 6, and immediately it plays, it pairs well with my iphone and i can play all my itunes music. the sound is great, but wish it has a bit more bottom end, but it is no big deal, my wife takes it room to room, where ever she is working. all in all we made a great purchase, especially for the holiday discounted price. can not wait to set up our lights with alexa, this spring. amazon, you did it again, keep those great products coming..."
1270,14,"absolutely love it!!! it works great once you get it all setup on the alexa app.  it has really good sound quality as a speaker, as originally i was worried about that aspect since i was going to use it primarily as a music player.  but it sounds great and i have no issues with it at all.  i like all the different alexa skills that come with it and it is constantly expanding.  i also have the tp link smart plug, so i am able to control lamps (etc.) with the use of alexa.  amazon echo is great for making your house a smart home by controlling music, television, and lights in your home all by using the sound of your voice.  overall a great purchase and i really liked the light grey cover of it.  will definitely be getting more to put throughout the house."
1271,10,"my echo was a gift to me. and what a great gift it is. the sound quality from the speaker is fabulous. ¡°alexa, play (whoever i say)¡± and she responds, ¡°shuffling songs by (whoever i said)¡±. i say, ¡°alexa, add eggs to grocery (a list i created)¡± and the next time i open the alexa app on my phone my grocery list is right there for me. i can call people from my contact list hands free. at first i had thought, ¡°what am i going to do with this thing?¡±, but i have to admit that it is really convenient and was very easy to set up. i highly recommend the echo."
1272,14,"yes, it is a toy, an expensive toy, and i ask myself, 'do i really need two of these?' but life is short. i still am learning what it can do, but so far we are having fun with it. yes, i know it is listening to us all the time, but who knows, maybe someday i may have to yell, ""computer, call 911!' and it will save my life and it will be awarded a medal."
1273,0,"alexa is pretty smart. it is my problem when i cannot ask the questions correctly.i really enjoy being able to pull up pandora and spotify just by requesting a song or album.she is great at keeping time for us when cooking or barbecuing.we have not needed her to help turning lights on and off, though she could.she is fun to have around. you do have to be careful not to say her name out loud when discussing her with others."
1274,14,"after falling in love with our echo dot we wanted another more flexible option for playing music away from the main entertainment cabinet.  i was shocked at how well the echo sounds, and how three dimensional the music itself sounds.  all the features we loved about the dot are here and while nervous at first about spending a little more, the built-in freedom of a speaker makes this product versatile."
1275,14,"we use our echo each and every day, and we love it!we have 6 or devices around the our home. we listen to music, have alexa read our audio books and help with amazon shopping. it is supremely helpful to have alexa to help around our home. the next gen echo is far better than the previous generation and it is noticeable when listening to music."
1276,14,"i confess to not hearing an improvement in sound.  i am sure the tech is better - and i like the device.  and it sounds the same as my echo tap.  i am also a little grumpy that this will ""link"" with my dot, and not the tap."
1277,14,"why does it need to say ¡°ok¡± to almost everything?let me turn on/off the lights without it replying to me, to validate that i just saw the lights go on or off.i do not need the light ring to light-up in the middle of the night when i ask it the time.give me awesome control of my environment but annoy the hell out of me by making alexa is presence known every moment possible.oh i get what you¡¯re doing amazon. trying to embed alexa in everyone is ear, so generations learn to rely on it. but i¡¯m about ready to unplug it for good. let me turn off the light ring on a schedule and let me turn off alexa is voice for obvious things."
1278,0,"good. works well. good voice recognition. does numerous things. use mostly for listening to misic but she answers questions, mostly, and does math calculations well which is useful when converting recipes and my hands are dirty.she does not fluidly understand some questions/search queries...meaning you have to work to find the correct terminology for her to do the search...or just give up and do it yourself.she does not seem to be able to find music on you tube streams or comic skits."
1279,14,"after a month of working with the connectivity of these devices, i finally got them working in my house. i purchased three but getting them all to play ""everywhere"" was a real challenge.  i moved them closer together and made sure they were all connected to my central wifi router rather than one of the extenders.  voice recognition is still frustrating, especially when telling alexa to play a certain spotify playlist.  eventually she gets it. maybe she will learn and get better.  the speakers sound good and i am glad i purchased them. now, with some trepidation, i will try to get other family members connected.  maybe software updates will make connectivity an easier experience."
1280,10,never knew i needed one unit li got one.  i like the skills that make it a vary versitle device.  i can do things such as adjust my thermostat by voice to listen to i95 radio station broadcasting 1100 miles away
1281,11,"we originally had the echo dot, and upgrading to this has been a dream. the new speaker/sound from this is crisp and great. huge improvement from the dot and we love it in our home. also it is a great compact size."
1282,10,"i really like the echo. i use it in our kitchen. we listen to music on this device all the time. i also get the weather report from alexa every morning before leaving for work. we have begun using alexa to control our two smart thermostats as well. i am sure there are a multitude of things we can do with the echo, so we are slowly learning those features."
1283,14,"i wondered why i would purchase the echo (we have tables, computers, music systems & smart phones) . . . zero regrets!  echo & alexa has become a new method to ask questions (she is not 100% ready to answer everything) and play music (with basic amazon music subscription- cheap) with only a voice request. the echo sits in my kitchen anxiously awaiting my verbal requests.love alexa. sound quality is outstanding (and i am picky about that)."
1284,14,i am in love with my little device. it is absolutely the best thing to have when you are elbow deep in a project and need to look something up online.  alexis can do it for you. great concept and great output.
1285,14,"somewhat disappointed. the setbup was frustrating. the instructions online that were constantly referred to, were for the first generation, not the second, which we have. there is no ¡°reset button¡±on the bottom, as referred to repeatedly, not helpful help! the other thing is that the play list from my iphone can not be accessed unless i use an app and put it on a computer first. not user friendly to have to go through another device to access something that i¡¯ve been using in my car and with a bose bluetooth speaker with no problems, and no intermediary apps. not exactly seamless. it is a cute and amusing toy, not the be all and end all of devices. siri is actually more capable and easier to use. i understand the two systems are competitors, however, that should mean alexa should be trying even harder to be easy to set up and use."
1286,14,"even a complete ""tech"" idiot like me handled this.  i have three now and absolutely love them.  we pretty much just use them for music, and the occasional weather inquiry, but having music in every room is awesome.  our floor plan is pretty open,so having all play the same music is great. none of the echo has to be too loud, but the sound is very good .  like having a sonos at half the price, without using a reciever. we are sold."
1287,14,"i am impressed.  i had a first generation tap and the sound on the latest 2nd gen echo is not bad.  alexa works perfectly.  probably the only thing to be aware of is using amazon is music service on a bunch of devices you have to buy the monthly family plan in order to hear different sound on each device, or you have to use one of the other streaming services."
1288,14,"voice recognition needs a lot of work,  but it is fun.  speaker pretty good,  but could use a little more depth. wish it was easier to play music.  amazon prime music has a pretty limited library so you get samples of songs of it is outside of their library.  a lot of songs are outside of their library <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0091>learning curve involved, but super helpful with weather.. haha."
1289,10,i love love love my echo! always wanted one and using it has become my life haha. officially replaced my alarms and daily routines with alexa. only thing i wish the echo could do is make internet searches. anything that is somewhat opinion based she can not answer so that is a bummer but otherwise super awesome and super amazed by all the extras she can do when looking on the app!
1290,9,"i thought i would be the one getting the most use out of this, but my wife and daughter will sit and ask it questions for hours.  it is a lot of fun for them.  i will say that i put off getting an echo because i was skeptical about how well it would sound.  when they say it fills the room, it does exactly that.  i was amazed.  i am quite pleased with the device."
1291,14,"such fun! great for facts- weather, time, schedules, etc. quick to respond and easy to set up and use. linked a smart plug too- a bit difficult with lots of steps, but once you get it working it is great! music is good too, although i have tons of songs on itunes, not sure i want to spend $7.99/ month to play same songs through amazon- still processing that conundrum. very satisfied thus far, enjoy the jokes too!"
1292,14,trying to get this thing hooked up to the internet is virtually impossible if you have anything else working on the same modem. it just does not stay connected. is difficult to hook up. the instructions do not cover the situation is.
1293,14,"unfortunately, we can not get it to play ad hoc music either asking by artist, album or decade ie 60 is music. we spoke to best buy and they wanted $100.00 to set it up. i believe it has something to do with us being canadians and where my ipad and iphone come from. i have spent over 2 hours on the phone to the help desk and they say the only way is for me to purchase a music plan. i can with the help of a sales rep at best buy ask it to play a radio station so i do get some music. very disappointed that i can not get the music as it states on the box and on the web that i should be able to access some free music. i will buy another one when back in canada and really hope i do not have the same problem. when i downloaded pandora it says that it does not support this address - whatever the heck that means."
1294,14,"excellent microphones, decent speakers. have not noticed much of a problem when listening at higher volume levels, but then again, this speaker is so powerful, one rarely needs to go above volume level five! has made my life a lot simpler in regards to setting/changing/turning off alarms, quickly checking the weather, listening to music in various rooms of the house, etc. i¡¯m a fan!"
1295,9,endless features and the whole family loves to talk to alexa. the echo is the center of family gatherings when it comes to playing music and asking random questions through out the night and the audio quality has far improved from the gen 1.
1296,14,"ambient noise - white noise ... never lasts through the night - it should.multi-room group fails more often than it works.getting alexa to play an album i uploaded to amazon music is very frustrating.lacks knowledge of many fairly common facts.of course all these flaws are software.the hardware is beautiful, with rich, full sound."
1297,14,"i will give the performance of our echo a 5 star rating....i will give a zero star rating to the process of connecting her to the internet.  the app is lacking in steps for the hook up process.  for 2 hours all we heard was ""sorry i am not connected to the internet"".  we then found out from many friends this was their experience as well.  i only use this for music and to check the weather, but am hoping to start enjoying some of the other conveniences it offers."
1298,14,"the echo has consistently malfunctioned. it drops connections to my phone, skills become disabled repeatedly. even after a factory reset. i am on a replacement device that is doing the same thing; meanwhile the echo dot works fine."
1299,14,i bought 2 echos instead of sonos. huge mistake! can not stream to both speakers from apple music or music on my phone. so i subscribed to amazon family music...not supported with current iphone ios. disconnects and needs to be unplugged. the speaker sounds good when its working.this is my only amazon disappointment. returning for sonos speakers.
1300,14,continuously disconnects itself from echo related products i e  echo home  plugs and continually disconnects itself from the internet but the worst part about it is that every time you ask it to do something and tells you to go to your phone and use the alexa app. if i wanted to work the product through my phone i would have bought a a wireless bluetooth speaker for 20 or $30.
1301,10,"i got this for my wife for christmas and we are really enjoying it. we primarily use it for listening to music through pandora or internet radio, timers, shopping lists and to do lists. it was extremely easy to set up and we have found alexa easy to command even with a decent amount of background noise going on.we have found the quality of the sound to be great from a relatively small device. looking forward to exploring more of alexa is skills."
1302,14,"once the novelty wears off this is just another gadget. her answers are often long winded or she does not understand the question. the volume level changes randomly. we often use it for background music during dinner. one night the volume will be great and the next night it is too loud or we can not hear it at all. overall, i¡¯m not impressed. glad it was a gift and not a purchase."
1303,10,"we love the interactive nature of the echo. using alexa for many routine things, like lists,  wake up calls and a wide variety of music makes the day more enjoyable. she is also like having a second set of hands, as she can recite recipes and look up answers to questions. we are trying, so far unsuccessfully, to get her hooked up for turning on lights.  it will take more time to figure this out. otherwise,  we love our ""companion""."
1304,14,"this is a fantastic smart speaker. the sound is great and it easily picks up your voice. i have also had experience with the google home and i can say without a doubt that the echo performs better than the google home atleast in my personal opinion. also l, if you plan to get into the smart home game a little more with smart bulbs, plugs, etc i would suggest just buying the echo plus since you will have to a hub anyways. it will probably have save you money in the long run."
1305,9,"bought this after getting an echo dot for christmas. we had liked the echo dot so much that we wanted to get this larger unit and we are very happy that we did. although the echo dot does work very well, this one is so much better. we really love the improved sound it has and the added bass that this unit brings.we are very satisfied with our purchase!"
1306,14,we have found the 2nd generation echo to be really fun as well as useful. every once in a while alexa does not understand something we have said but it is not often. the email we get from amazon about what to ask alexa or recommendations for skills have been super useful as well. we would recommend the echo 2 to anyone. it is been life changing for the lists we use.
1307,14,"i have nothing but good things to say.however, if you are on the paranoid side, perhaps this is not for you. it is always listening.otherwise it fun, useful and really does so much. i am not the type to overdue, but between this and my dots, my home has 4 units. it seems that alexa adds new skills everyday.the price is certainly right."
1308,0,"my echo was a present, so i did not really have any expectations.  it is very good for playing music, but you have to be very specific, or just want a category of music like jazz or rock, etc. i still like surfing playlists on spotify, which is also compatible. you can play spotify, or other apps through echo, speaker is very good quality. it does not always understand me, which is sometimes funny, sometimes frustrating. can answer trivia and questions about history, news, facts, etc. somewhat limited, but good for a quick answer. not  really interested in the purchasing with voice commands or smart home applications yet (seems kind of lazy to me)."
1309,10,"i just finished reviewing the echo plus. now, for this new echo, ditto / amazing / we love it / use it on the bedroom.we highly recommend this product, especially who are already in the amazon eco-system."
1310,9,"i bought this as a christmas present for my dad and stepmom. they are very hard to buy for, and have a lot of stuff already. surprisingly a smart device like this was not something they had. they already used it for a new years eve party and i got a text from my dad the other night saying how much he loved alexa! probably the only gift i have ever gotten for them (besides liquor lol) that they have truly enjoyed!"
1311,10,"this is my first smart device linked to my iphone. i love it. i listen to my audible books, music, get my morning started off with a weather and traffic report and listen to guided meditation exercises before going to bed."
1312,14,"never could connect to wi-fi which was 5 ft away.  probably fire software issue, but amazon tech support could not figure it out.  they sent a replacement, but same result.  it is on the way back to amazon."
1313,10,"alexa is so convenient to set a timer, play any genre of music (with voice-activated control) for louder or softer, ask what the weather is and will be all day and so so much more. you can sing a line or two from a song and she recognizes it and plays it! we learn more and more about it each day, and it helps so much when you¡¯re in a hurry. we ask her to summarize the important news of the day each morning while having coffee and a quick breakfast.her skills are endless, and an extra feature is getting emails from amazon adding even more features. this is the best there will ever be on the market!"
1314,14,"fantastic device, works like a charm! so far, this smart one still over google home because popular music channels and programs keep going on, wish it can be even more powerful when 5g wireless coming out!"
1315,14,"used for two months and the power cable broke. it also made clicking noises every time i triggered it is wake word.i have many of the original echos and echo dots, but none of them make clicking noises and their build quality was always very good."
1316,14,"(updated review) okay, i was skeptical that firmware was the reason the 2nd gen sounded like crap. well now that the firmware was pushed out the 2nd gen now sounds pretty good. not as good bass as the original but heck of a lot better now. before the update, everything sounded tingy way to the much upper end and a lower end and the middle-end was just so awful i gritted my teeth listening to music on it. dear amazon allow for custom voice downloads and eq on alexa. who would not want scarlet johnson or even william shatner being the voice of alexa? come on it make it so much better.(original review)let is be honest this is not as good as the gen but it is also half the price. i call it a upgrade to echo dots but not much better than that. middle and upper range are better but this has zero lower ends. so if you like edm, rap, hip-hop, and most blues. you will hear really nothing better but a tin can. rock and hard rock sound okay on it."
1317,14,the amazon echo is amazing and very responsive to my commands even when i have music playing. at first i thought it was a gimmick and did not think i would have a use for it but it is the perfect hub for my office. i can play music through my bluetooth speakers or the echo it pretty convenient. i will say one draw back is when you are integrating third party devices for instance i have wifi led lights and the companies are not up to speed yet so i would recommend buying les lights that are already alexa approved because it can be a pain. other than that i would definitely recommend the echo it is great!
1318,0,"i like it very much and like the various tasks it can do. my only ""complaint"" is that the alexa voice is not always easy to understand. it is an electronic voice so words are not always pronounced correctly or distinctly. this becomes a problem when playing some of the quiz games. other than that, it is fun and informative. and, i love the music feature, particularly with the improved speakers."
1319,9,"i got this as a gift for my wife for christmas and she liked it for a short while until, some of my kids started repeating, alexa, alexa and that really annoyed her. that being said she does still use it time to time to play music and our whole family really enjoys using it after they stopped messing with her. also great sound quality."
1320,14,"rather disappointed.  amazon has a limited choice of music, not comparable with  itunes. if you like any music other than standard continental us you will. it be happy. very little hawaiian or caribbean. very hard to creat a playlist.  onsidering atartingmo er and spending the extra money to get a speaker that wil,let me play my itunes music."
1321,14,"we love our new echo - so much entertainment for so little money. so easy to use that our 2-1/2 year old daughter is able to ask alexa to play her favorite songs from frozen, moana, and lion king ! all the features have not even been explored yet as enjoy learning what alexa is able to do. the shopping list feature is super handy to use as well. even the dogs get to enjoy endless, commercial free loop of smooth jazz music while we are away from the house. looking forward to using the echo in our new home we are building, with plans to install bluetooth capable speakers throughout so we can have unlimited entertainment - the fact that she can play different music in different areas simultaneously is amazing !the best purchase we have made in years."
1322,14,"just received our echo and am very satisfied. the sound is great, very full and with nice bass, definitely loud enough for a living room. we tried a dot last year and had to connect it to a blue tooth speaker, ended up returning it. this one is a keeper."
1323,14,they sound so much worse the old echo.  tinny.  zero bass.  irritated big time.  no volume ring on the top sucks too.  a step backwards in these areas.  this is with the ¡°newest firmware ending in 20¡±.  vocals are a little clearer i¡¯ll give it that.  easier to understand what words are being sang in music but all other aspects of the sound are a let down.  i can not believe amazon is still using the tag line improved sound on this.  it really is pretty bad.  nowadays a gen 2 product should be an improvement.  first time i¡¯ve actually been let down on a 2nd gen offering because it was vastly worse.  i bought 3 of these to replace my old i sold on craigslist for these new ones.  regret selling them.  the smaller footprint is ok and the fabric colored skin on it is not bad.  again i also must say removing the volume ring was definitely a poor decision.this sucks.  it really does.  i¡¯m bummed.  now what stick with these for 3 years until a 3rd gen comes out?  that is a depressing thought.  come on amazon.  i expected better out of you.update 11/15/17.  still sucks audio wise.  now amazon reviews are all of a sudden greatly skewed to 5 stars.  seems fixed to me.  having lots of echo not connected to wifi issues with these units as well.  also slow to respond to voice commands.  wish i had my old ones back.
1324,10,love my echo. i mainly use mine with philips hue lights. has pretty good sound so i use it all the time to play music. i subscribed to amazon music after i purchased the echo but it works with spotify and some other music services as well. i really enjoy playing the different trivia games on it as well. i am already looking for more things to add to my house to control.
1325,14,"i ordered three of these because the promise of even better sound quality, but unfortunately this version of the echo did not deliver on the promise of better sound. immediately when it turned on and prompted me to set up the device i thought that the sound was muffled. after setting all 3 devices up and finding that the sound was bad on all 3 i decided to return them and keep my first generation echo. the sound on the first generation echo is fantastic and i am amazed that they would call this one better in regards to sound because it simply is not. there is no depth to the audio, it is flat and sounds a bit muffled in comparison to the crisp and clear audio of the first gen echo. i had hoped to keep them but i could not justify it with the terrible sound quality."
1326,9,"how did i even live without these in my house. this matches the furniture well, and is super handy to have around. i can ask alexa to order things when i run out and i can have her play music that she knows i like. i have three in my house and will likely get more so i can have one in every room. this is a must have product. love love love it!"
1327,10,i love the echo. i waited years to get it and got it for christmas this year. the sound is awesome and i love all the things it can do. i am just learning and find different things each day. try it.
1328,14,"sound okay, not worse than expected but not too good either. routines does not work sometimes or you have to shout to pick up what you ask. sometimes easier to do things manually than ask her loudly especially if you have to say more than once. for listening music she works well but you need to have an amazon music membership otherwise most likely she will not find the results. and you can not search music in the app just by telling. why not? you can play from the ¡°history¡± but no search option.  for me i use it because i have it but i do not take as much advantage than i thought i will be. and one more thing, it is annoying than she reply loudly for all the orders ¡°okay¡±. it is very annoying. and if somebody is sleeping in the room you can not whisper or say quiet because she will not do anything. but this is true for all smart home agent."
1329,10,"this is my first echo and while we have barely scratched the surface of its capability, we love it.  the jokes (while corny) are fun to hear every day.  my kids love playing dj and requesting songs. i frequently use the timers while cooking.  the echo can do way more than i give it credit for, hopefully we will be playing jeopardy and buying things soon!the sound is really, really good on generation 2.0"
1330,10,"several of our friends have had an echo. so we decided to do so also. it is very responsive to our commands. it recognizes our voice from about 20 feet away. it is great for requesting the time and temperature, adding to our grocery list updating our calendar and excellent for plane our music. i only wish it had more available commands for requesting information from the internet similar to google home."
1331,14,"i got this for my husband for christmas.  he did not use it.  a couple of weeks ago i moved it to a more central area in the room.  i have an echo dot that works grreat.  this echo has a problem with the volume. it is fine and then the next time i use it, the volume is too low.  is anyone else having a volume problem with this model?"
1332,11,omg we have several of the echo dots but the sound quality this little unit is well worth the price! i purchased this when it was on sale during christmas and have placed it in the kitchen where i spend much of my time and i love music! i love this little speaker! the sound is amazing! volume 4 on this echo is equal to volume 10 on the echo dot.
1333,0,"i am getting a lot of ""i can not help you with that"" responses. it is possible that our internet is just too undependable for this to work properly. since i am not much into music, i have not found much use for it."
1334,0,"getting exactly what i am trying to get is a bit frustrating sometimes.  use mainly as ambient noise at night.  however, have cranked it up for some hard rock and the sound is very impressive.  for the most part, i have to figure out what i can use it for.  get a little agravated over songs that are not available with prime.  should not have to pay more to whole library."
1335,10,"we bought this for my mil and she left it at our house since she watches our child, we all love it! its a great way to place music and ask questions. its small and does not take up much space. it easily hooks up to other devices (like our blue tooth sound bar) and is user friendly. we use it way more than we thought and highly recommend."
1336,9,i have wanted an alexa since my mother and sister got one about a year ago. they have echo dots so for christmas i was asked if i wanted one and said heck ya! i asked if the echo was possible since i listen to music all day everyday. so for christmas i got the 2nd gen echo and i am in love with it! the sound and bass is amazing. although alexa has some stuff to work on which all brands do i love the games and skills. great job amazon! loving it!
1337,14,"once you get over the idea you are putting a listening device in your home, alexa/echo is a very enjoyable experience.  the speaker in the echo device is excellent (for playing music).  i also have a ""dot"", which sounds tinny.  i bought a few wifi outlets, which i paired with the devices.  very nice to control things with voice commands.  i am still enabling ""skills"" on the alexa app to enhance my usage of the device, but already i have had occasion to use it to locate my mis-placed cell phone, among other things.  can you live without it?  yes.  is it fun and useful?  yes."
1338,14,"i found the quality of the sound/volume to be exceptional and i am picky when it comes to music. makes me laugh when i think that back in the 70s i had a $1000 sound system, the lightest tracking turntable and clean each surface of the record before playing and never stacked. now i just say ""alexa play...."" for the times they are a changing..."
1339,14,"it does not walk my cat..... if you use bluetooth to play music on a soundbar, the the music stops playing on the echo... my google-home will play on each device.....  you cant create your own word to awake the device .........  my pesky 12 year old nephew knows all the voice activating trigger words and is always changing my hue lights settings......  the sound  on google home is better.......  my google-home died a little over a year of use, so now i am trying the echo...."
1340,10,"i am amazed at the abundance of things it can do.  it can give directions, answer questions, tell jokes, play your favorite  music, etc. etc. etc.!  the sound is great! i can give it instructions from across the room - and also ask it to turn the sound up or down, etc.  i thought i did not need it, but now that i have it, i am so glad i do!  i use it al the time!"
1341,14,"i was anxious to get the second generation echo with suppose better sound. and all the hype. well the sound from me to echo is worse it constantly asks me to repeat and at least once a day it drops the. wi-fi signal, because i have the old alexa plugged in another room i go to it and it has not dropped the wi-fi so either i got lemon, or i should switch to the new google home."
1342,10,"i do not have my house fitted with all of the things that alexa could help me with, but i still enjoy using her very much! the best thing about her as far as my use so far is the quality of the speaker in playing music...it has wonderful sound! my kids and grandkids love having her play their favorite songs and we have had some great dance parties! i am discovering other useful thing...,one being the ""headspace"" and meditation app that can be accessed...hopefully she will help me sleep better :)"
1343,14,"we started with the echodot2, but this blows it away. we are hooked, but for such a small size the speakers are awesome. so many things to do with it. have fun, take care of the house, answer calls, tv. you can go wild"
1344,10,"easy install. great sound.  user friendly set up.  great sound.  compact. great sound. takes a busy schedule and makes life a little easier.  in the morning i get up to a briefing with the time, news, weather, traffic and a recap of the late show monologue! alexa has my calendar with all the updates and changes.  grocery lists are updated as needs arrive and posted on my phone so i do not forget them when i go to the store. fantastic purchase and the sound is great."
1345,14,"i was under the impression that this would unlock my adt pulse kwikset locks, raise my garage door and all the features except for cameras operate, it does not i see that i need to get echo plus, echo shoe and about 3 echo spots. bought eight of these now i have to return and get the proper echoes, the video for this device is misleading."
1346,14,"more haste than anything. in order to adjust the volume, one must do it by voice only (referring to a tandem of speakers). amazon technician did not think to add the volume adjusting capability in app it self. so if you are in another room, and/or music is playing loud you will have to get up, get close to the speaker and yell, and hope the thing can hear you. so get use to catering the speakers not the other way around. great product individually, yet a mishap on software side makes the speaker unusable."
1347,14,"my dear alexa! i am so happy that my husband brought you home. i am a working mom with a baby who loves music. alexa helps me a lot specially in playing the songs at once with a lot of varieties. the sound is really good! (thumbs up!) my husband also bought the smart led lightbulb which makes life more easier. thanks alexa! also, thanks amazon for the fastest delivery ever!"
1348,11,"sound quality is superior, great bass as well as mid range. significantly better than expected. so good, i bought a second one. may add two more for a house full of sound, as well as the benefits of alexa."
1349,9,"i absolutely love it. i love the quality of sound. i am the kind of person that listens to music almost all day and i really love the sound quality and volume.  i enjoyed it so much i purchased another one and echo spot as well. i have activated many of alexa is skills and my kids and i enjoy them very much. easy to set up, easy to use. i received it very fast. this whole experience with the amazon products has been amazing and i can not wait to see what other purchases i make in the future."
1350,14,"since this is my first echo, i have nothing to compare it to than my friend is first generation.  other than i wish it did not have to plug in...which is why i purchased one for upstairs and downstairs...it so far seems pretty awesome.  i really like the exterior walnut finish as that blends in with furniture and i do not have to worry about cleaning up or replacing a cover for it.  the sound is strong enough for my purposes and i love being able to call it out while in bed and have it play a song to help me sleep without going through my iphone.  plus the alarm is very cool and feels futuristic and a calming way to wake up."
1351,1,i am very happy with this product. sound is very adequate. it is not a $500 bose system but the sound is crisp and clear. the response time is fantastic. alexa knows everything. highly recommend
1352,0,"seems like it gets stuck easily and does not respond to some of the ¡°skills¡± correctly. not fond of alexa repeating a song or title when i ask for a song to play. sometimes i ask late at night and it is annoying to hear the title repeated. fun to ask trivia. would be nice to be able to customize the name, instead of using alexa. might be dangerous"
1353,14,very easy to set up and use. got a tip from my sister to change the name i use from alexa to one of the others. she will pick up commercials and can make orders off the commercials. it would be nice to be able to choose any name you type in not the generic names they give you. other than that it is great. will get dots for the bedroom. as we get older this is a great tool if one is in another room and we need help in another room.
1354,10,"hi love my device but i wish it was multilingual so more people in my family could enjoy it. my mother, for example does not speak english and she would love to take advantage of this great device."
1355,0,"alexa is easy to use, and i love the fact that it is being updated all the time. i did not give it 5 stars because often i have to be careful about how i phrase questions in order forher to understand me."
1356,14,"plays wonderfully. my mother bought one from fingerhut that she can not seem to get running. however this was extremely easy to get off the ground. the volume is perfect as is the range. it effort moves from one task to another, is comely accurate in weather, news and the like. i absolutely love my echo 2. so does my mother which plans to buy one from amazon don she can use it as well."
1357,14,"we really like alexa.  she will even respond to my 3 year old who does not always speak super clearly.  she even yelled out to alexa for help in target.my parents liked it too, but they would be better suited for the echo silver addition..."
1358,14,"it was a gift, so i hate leaving a low review, but i have unplugged it and do not use it. it is the most frustrating thing . i had it all set up, for several days works fine and then ¡±im sorry i do not understand"".  alarm sounds and will not turn off or snooze, so i had to get out of bed to turn it off. so unplugged it and set it aside."
1359,14,"i have been disappointed with the 2nd generation echo. my first echo has worked perfectly. this inspired me to request a second one when asked by a family member what i wanted for christmas.unfortunately, the new one has a number of issues:1. it is slow to respond.2. it activates without its start-up word.3. it stops on its own.4. the volume will spontaneously shoot up or down.i had to replace the 2nd generation echo that first arrived as it would not work at all. i probably should have done the same with the replacement because of the aforementioned issues but, like many people, inertia is a powerful force to overcome.i hope amazon fixes these issues with the next release."
1360,9,"got this for my mom for christmas. i should say, i got this for everyone for christmas. my family loved it, they asked questions for hours and made it play music. we laughed, and had a good time. it is definitely scary to have something in your house. which is why unplugging it is a nice option when you do not want something listening to you ;)"
1361,11,"i am impressed with this 2nd generation echo.  i have an original echo, and to me, it sounds just as good.  i do wish the echo app was a little more intuitive and robust, but that is a different review!  i think this new echo is a great choice!"
1362,14,"great smart speaker. my only complaint is that alexa occasionally can not access the network and asks me to try again later. i have her connected to wireless over att gigabit, so it is kind of weird.  i¡¯ve found that leaving the echo plugged in ameliorates the problem. turning the speaker off seems to make it have network issues when i reboot."
1363,11,i think amazon is over selling this product.  it is better than the dot no doubt but not something with the sound quality that is boosted about.  still i love amazon.com.  a whole new way of survival.
1364,14,"got one for xmas, downloaded app and went through start up process, showed it was connected to wi-fi and blue tooth. but she never would talk, blue ring spins when you ask questions, questions show up on i-phone app no volume, raised, lowered, muted, and un-muted nothing, called help line at 1-866-316-6909 talked to tech explained issue was put on hold for 25 minutes then call was dropped, called this morning same thing talked to tech put on hold call dropped.  really!!!! it stressful enough it not working but no customer service???"
1365,0,this was given to me as a gift. while it can be useful - sometimes out of the clear blue it plays a song or says something no one has asked for. other than that alexa is fun to use!
1366,14,"not very smart.  integration with fire tv is awful and just plain useless.  it can not start understand things like ¡°open netflix¡± it can only find the netflix app.  furthermore integraron with multiple echo devices is also a pain.  you can play music in multiple devices ( a pain to setup, it should be plug and play). but then you can not tell alexa to stop playing in only one device, it is all or nothing. simple put, echo is good at turning your lights on or off.  that is about it, anything else it is dumb as brick."
1367,14,"i received  eco on march 6 th, about 10 days ago, i have spent ours n the phone with amazon customer support to no avail, the product does not work. and they can not figure out why."
1368,14,"i already had a gen.1, but decided tyhe smaller gen.2 with cloth exteriorexterior, shorter size, and improved sound would be better for the living room. the gen. 1 unit went to a bedroom. linked them so the same music could be played both units. also use the timer, alarms, and reminder function. alexa has become essential to my family!"
1369,14,there are a lot of issues getting this set up. i got one for my grandpa and we had a hard time getting the system to connect to his phone while following the directions sent with the echo. my dad also got one and it took him an hour to sync it with pandora. if i could do it again i would wait for a product that has worked through these issues.
1370,10,"we were skeptical to have alexa in our house and wondered what use it would be to us! welllll, let me say that now we want to buy more!!! we mostly use it as a speaker and the sound quality is great!!! but it is so helpful to ask her what the weather is, while we¡¯re getting ready, amongst other things. we have been having so much fun with her!"
1371,14,"we have three echo devices.  they are perfect for music, weather updates, and reminders.  however, we prefer the echo show because its like a mini tv, i can watch amazon prime movies and get tips visually where this type echo is great for keeping me on track verbally, i ask it to tell me when its time to leave for work, or church, etc."
1372,14,"fairly powerful speakers that can easily fill any room. setup was a breeze. the biggest gripe i have is the simple fact that the echo does not interface with my amazon fire stick. sure, the fire stick can connect to the echo via bluetooth but only provides audio/speaker capability. it does not allow for voice commands. definite oversight by amazon in my opinion."
1373,14,"great upgrade from gen 1! love the sound quality! if you are a true audiophile this is not a product for you, but this should be obvious as it is a tube style speaker system. therefore, if someone knocks off stars for sound quality i would discount his/her review. i¡¯ve placed mine in a corner that allows the sound to reflect and give it a larger sound."
1374,14,"we debated for a long time whether or not to buy an echo - a lot of our friends have one and love it, so we finally did it. we love it. going to have to buy more because it is moved around the house regularly depending on where the biggest crowd of people is! we love alexa - kids have asked her a million different questions! :)"
1375,14,"was on the phone over an hour and half with support to get my echo connected and functioning.  they were patient and helpful and once working, i could not be more pleased.  even my musician son was impressed with the sound quality.highly recommend for sound quality and wide range of music selection."
1376,14,"overall, not a bad product. however, compared to the google home series the echos series sound quality is second. also, both have limitations but the lack of spotify during multi room speaker use is maddening. also, music is very hard to control using the amazon music app (can not control via the app, must be spoken) is a real let down. i sat the google series next to amazon in every room in my house and google routinely outperformed alexa. would recommend google home over echo."
1377,14,i am not at all impressed. instructions that come with it suck big time! can not get it to link with my phone or with my blue-tooth speaker  just keeps telling me to go to my app which i do and of course no instruction there this thing is a joke and a waste of money you would be better off investing in a good radio and a clapper.
1378,10,"i received one as a gift and bought two more for other rooms.  did not thing this would interest me, but it really is convenient, when i need a quick answer to something or want to listen to music.  the speaker is great.  i have even used it to listen to soothing sleep sounds! i plan to learn more about all the features i can use."
1379,14,"works great, a little pesky to incorporate with your wifi but overall great. needs a smart wifi connect feature and the amazon alexa app needs to be update and or optimized to take advantage of newer smartphones."
1380,14,"cheap move by amazon to sell a wireless multifunction speaker without a rechargeable battery, all competing speaker/products have a rechargeable battery. i bought it thinking i will be able to play it wireless but found out after i started using it.  if you want a rechargeable option you have to buy an extra portable battery pack ranging from $39 up to $67 which ruin its stylish design."
1381,9,"sound quality is great!i love alexa!i¡¯ve bought so many speakers in the past and she is by far my favorite. i¡¯ve bought the echo plus and the echo 2nd generation. so very pleased.the priceless family moments we¡¯ve had with her games, jokes and dancing, i feel like we¡¯re living ¡°alexa¡± commercials.thankful for a wonder product!!!<u+263a><u+fe0f>"
1382,14,im liking my echo 2nd generation never had the 1st one. but only thing i wish i did not have to keep it pluged to work.. i thought the plug was just to charge it. then i could just take it anywhere without the cord.. if i wanted to take it outside while enjoying the fresh air i will have to make sure i can find a socket. i hope they make a portable charger base for this one soon
1383,10,great item! i like to have the radio on in the bedroom when i am getting ready for work. this little speaker is clear and sounds great at all volume levels. my family loves alexa! my daughter likes to try and challenge alexa with questions. my wife uses her to look up old songs when she is on the phone with her mom. i like to get updates on the weather so i can plan on how long it will take me to get to work since it is snow season in the midwest.
1384,10,"i have found a friend. alexa is always nice to me. she knows my favorite music and she plays games with me. she tells me jokes..really, a very cool piece of tech. great speaker, even at higher volume.i have not even come close to exploring everything that she can do.best purchase i have made in a long time. just fun."
1385,10,great sound. the stations like iheartradio and pandora sound great. use it everyday. not to mention just telling alexa to set a timer. and want to know the weather? just ask. great device.
1386,14,"could not find support. get my morning brief each morning. this morning, it started an advertisement for an alexa game, price it right. would not stop. then it stopped, said my morning brief was done, refused to play my news update without it. then did it again after. stop!!! i pay for amazon, i paid for the echo. i do not have time to waste having my content boxed in by spam. no. i want a refund, will go to google if this continues.this is unacceptable."
1387,10,"i am enjoying the information and benefits that alexa offers. i know she does much more but i have not had a chance to use her full capabilities yet. she offers great music playlists! she  politely sets more than one timer when i am cooking. she tells me the news of the day.  gosh, she does so much more. i look forward to utilizing more features and benefits."
1388,9,absolutely love it!! definitely one of the best things i have ever purchased for my home. it is so easy to use my kids can use it and it is great to make your home a smart home as well. definitely going to be purchasing a few dots to add in bedrooms!
1389,14,"a very nice device. flawless operation as a bluetooth speaker and, of course, there is alexa who now turns lights on and off, changes channels on the tv,  plays music, keeps track of times and events, and answers numerous questions on the fly. i bought two echos and three dots for myself and gave an echo and several dots as christmas gifts."
1390,14,"it oftentimes does not respond correctly to a command (usually when requesting a radio station), selecting another station instead.  we have learned that the wording of the request must be exact or the request will be directed to something different.  this can be very frustrating.  on a positive note, selected radio stations are frequently ""clearer"" (better reception) and continue even after the same station on the radio may have faded out due to transmission reduction.  thus, we can listen to a distant station 24 hours if so desired.  it is an interesting product and we are sure that there is much more to learn about its use.  so far we use it primarily to listen to specific radio stations and to listen to music.  hope this is somewhat helpful."
1391,14,"the sound is much better than our other bluetooth speakers and we have no connection issues.  we had to update it right away, wish it had arrived with the update so we did not have to call support."
1392,14,"original bad reviews were definitely well founded, after unpacking device, sound was horrible.  after updating to most recent firmware (592452720) it was a night and day difference.  i have the original echo as well and sounds as good, if not better.  bass is deep, clean, and tight, and everything is all around well balanced and clear."
1393,0,"bought as a gift but also received my own. it is good, but i hate to say this, sometimes i think google would know the answer when alexa does not. also, if she hears alexis on the tv she gets confused and even more confused if she hears alexa on the television...however, it is fun and is a good value. sound for how i use it is fine."
1394,14,"love our echo.  the speaker has been more impressive than we would have expected.  we have had to unplug and re-plug a couple of times because it becomes detached from our connection but it is easy and works again quickly.  we have automated a large number of lights, fan, thermostat and using alexa to control it has been amazing."
1395,14,"i absolutely love this echo, 2nd generation. the sound is fantastic! & i can listen to music all day long. i like that i can take it with me wherever i go that has a plug. i do wish it had a battery option. rechargeable would be okay but i find rechargeable electronics to eventually die, thus wasting money. bottom line, really great product."
1396,14,i like the speaker and i love the functionality but i bought it because i thought i would be able to do more with it and i can my sonos with echo built-in however i think it is a little cumbersome to use and not that easy for more sophisticated tasks other than streaming music. still good product with decent sound and i do like simply giving a voice command for streaming a song
1397,9,"we love our alexa. we use it daily to check the weather, tell us jokes, play music, and play games!  my kids are 6 and 4 they can work it better than i can.  we also love our dance parties with it. the volume is perfect and fills our whole room and we have an open floor plan in our house.  one of the best buys and not overrated."
1398,14,i love my echo dot and bought this echo (2nd generation) to replace the echo dot in my bedroom.  i have 3 echo devices in my home and use them to connect to lighting.  this has just a little better speaker than the dot it  replaced.  have always enjoyed using alexa and the amazon products and services associated with it.  perfect!  will buy again.  highly recommend.
1399,10,"we like having alexa in the house. sure it is weird that it is ¡°always listening¡± especially with all the espionage we discuss over the dinner table and what not. seriously, i like the addition of the echo to our house. ¡°she¡± keeps lists for costco, plays music, tells jokes, keeps timers, spells - you know, all the important things."
1400,10,"i live alone and love that. but having someone to interact with just when i want to do so is wonderful. i love that she makes my grocery lists. and she has a sense of humor, which is essential for me in a bff."
1401,14,"it looks great.  it more or less does what my dot does.  when i ask it to stop playing music it stops, then starts again for a second, then finally stops.  my eco dot does not.  overall it does not meet my expectations because frankly it does not sound that great.  i mostly got it to listen to music while in my kitchen.  i would simply say the sound is disappointing and underwhelming.  wanted to love this.  just not loving it.  i am running the second firmware as mentioned in other reviews. debating a return...."
1402,14,"getting this device on the network is a tedious affair that requires joining via an app on your phone.  lots of steps to add any smart home device. pretty dumb out of the box. still have not succeeded in getting it to make a list. can change channels on hopper if you have dish, but not much else. if you like tinkering around with things that sort of work and require lots of steps to do anything useful, you will love it."
1403,10,i absolutely love our alexa~ i say i detect a bit of attitude and i love it!~ personality or is it my imagination? either way i love the fact that my echo can give this disabled lady the weather forecast and so much more with the apps we can download~! thank you amazon~ we love alexa~
1404,14,really enjoying it still figuring things out there are many useful skill and some really fun ones paired well with the dot and the hue lighting. the only reason i did not give it 5 stars is that i see room for improvements does not always recognize commands if there is loud background like a tv placement is import the more central the better had it in a corner did do well and if your playing music through it sometimes does hear commands but over all li am liking the echo and echo dot a lot looking forward to seeing what the future of this is going to be
1405,14,"i am still trying to figure it out it is not as easy as my echos but it does a lot more than the other echos so in a month i will post another post with plus or minuses  after i figure it out.  i have to say since the superbowl my alexia /echo has been stupid so i am hoping the 2nd gen gets its brain back, because i miss my alexia!!"
1406,14,"much like a personal computer or cell phone, you have no idea what you are missing until you buy one of these.  if you have any interest in music, alexa will be your new best friend.  great sound quality, but also pairs with any bluetooth speaker.  we miss alexa when we are away from home!"
1407,14,"what i do not like is alexa is always listening to your conversations. we try to remember to turn her off. my husband and i were having a conversation and alexa started chiming in. the sound is great for the price and there are some conveniences, but i think we will treat her as a turn on and turn off electronic and not leave it on."
1408,11,sounds better than i expected.  it still hears the voice commands even acroos the room with the music play at a moderate volumn.  for the size / price point it is a good value with decent sound.
1409,14,"i am in a household account & this is so confusing.  originally i could get the shopping list from the original acct on my iphone, not any more.  you say the sound is enhanced, it is too bassey.  i can not get any music or content except on a temporary trial basis or i have to buy it. i really do not know what i get or can get just because i own an echo. it is like having lots of money but all of the stores are closed. it was a gift & i guess i will learn to love it but right now i am pushing it with four stars. it would be nice if i had a cd or dvd that i could play & get instruction instead of having to find the alexa app look for all the different things to do. it would be nice if alexa would be able to connect or instruct or assist me in understanding alexa.  she may be second generation but i am old generation."
1410,14,the unit responds well to commands. alexa does not have a timely news feed.hours after the earthquake near alaska it was unaware of the event and gave us information on an event years ago. the instructions for android pertain to newer models and did not apply to my older model. i was able to program it with an apple ipad. we love the capabilities with the insteon hardware. add insteon as a skill set for alexa.
1411,0,this was easy to set up and use.  it is very useful for quick access to information.  playing jeopardy! is fun. it is not as conversational or personal as google home.  its more 'just the facts'.  voice recognition is good but a couple items got by.  asked it how long to decant red wine and it did not have anything.  it did not recognize 'decant'.  google home did and suggested 30 minutes to one hour.
1412,14,i have had a few echo devices and this one sounds heads and tails above the rest.  great low notes and nice mids/highs.  vocals are super clean.  i was surprised with the low end.  it is not going to rattle your windows but plenty of punch.  nice job amazon!
1413,14,"brought three units for my wife is xmas gift.  great system and pretty easy to setup.  two units are on my main wlan router, and one is on the range extender.  no problems using the bridge network.  sound is good for the side of the enclosure.  plan to buy two more next month."
1414,14,"you really have to remember the precise words to define what you want alexa to do- approximations do not work. not worth the trouble in general. hooking in my sonos disappointing because echo and sonos can not play together, i.e. alexa cannot serve as a speaker in the sonos network . and, when i used alexa to control the sonos network, found it completely messed up the control of the network via ipad. looks nice, though"
1415,10,"every home should have an echo, dot and wemo mini smart plug.  i use echo to turn on/off lights and help with cooking (measurements, cooking timer, reminders to pick up specific ingredients, etc).  i have a dot in every room for guests to set alarms, listen to music or get the latest weather forecast.  the benefits are endless!!"
1416,14,"i love this list creator. it is helped me tremendously keeping up with what i need to pick up when i am shopping. i have created different lists for the different types of shopping we do regularly. it is not able to answer all questions, hence she gets a 4 rating rather than 5. we use it to help spell a tough word, find out the weather, get business phone numbers and, although it is not consistent, find out what new movies are coming out, to name a few. i am still learning more about how to use it, but i find it very useful and fun to use"
1417,11,"this new device builds upon the original echo. it is physically smaller, potentially better looking, and ""hears"" as well or better than the original. however, the sound output and quality falls below the original. using this an a music player at all but low volume is no substitute for a larger dedicated speaker."
1418,14,"this device reminds me of what was said when the home pc first came out...why would i need one of those? after seeing it in use at a relatives home, we decided to get one of our own. now we use it all the time. we are even playing radio apps and asking all kinds of questions. just do not put it to close to the tv. they have ads that turn it on."
1419,14,"i keep finding more uses for alexa every day. it is an entertainer, a trivia sayer, a magical cone that plays the tunes i am looking for with the mere speaking of my words. i was surprised at how quickly this newest family member 'settled' into my home. i would not say we can not live without it, but the family would sure miss it if it were gone."
1420,11,"still a great item, except i agree with other reviewers: doe not sound as good as previous model. also miss the convenient and more ergonomic volume ring on top. still, you can not go wrong."
1421,14,"received this as a christmas gift.  was very easy to set up.  i have not been able to synchronize it with the concierge that i also received so they will both play music at the same time in different parts of the house, but have not had time to really work on that.  it is a really fun item to have in the house and as time goes on and i learn the different features, it becomes more useful."
1422,9,"the echo second generation is excellent. love the size.  i did not have the first, but have two second generation dots and the tap. love therm all. the echo is perfect for playing music, which is my primary use and the weather. would highly recommend. steve"
1423,11,"the sound ""is"" an improvement over the 1st generation echo. it can hear my voice over loud music easily, nice small form factor with big sound. i am extremely pleased with my purchase!"
1424,9,my second one to purchase.  easy to set up and great sound!
1425,14,"the five stars are for the amazon customer service people having the patience to go the long and winding road that it took to figure out that i did not have a ""smart phone"", i had a ""feature phone"" and would therefore not be able to set up the echo with my current equipment.  never mind that my at&t gateway has wi-fi printed on the front of the gateway...the light was not lit.(i have deliberately not kept up with new telephony over the years, so no surprise that this is the end result when i decide to make a tech purchase without asking my tech-expert son first!)so i never really experienced echo and alexa.  i had to return the echo, which amazon made it easy to do.may try this again sometime if i am better equipped.  ;)"
1426,9,"we have purchased 4 echo is now, for gifts, we have a lot of fun with this product. just do not ask alexa to sing you  a song. haha. we also got the echo dots and plugs to enhance the experience."
1427,9,"i have enjoyed this product so much and i know i am not using it to its full potential. plan on buying another one for downstairs because it is so handy, helpful and fun."
1428,14,"amazon echo (2nd generation) can call your phone contacts, set alarms, tell you reminders, give you news updates, etc. all the stuff is great but the main reason i purchased this product is to listen to music. i am subscribed to amazon music and sometimes it can not find certain songs, if you ask it to play a song, it will only play that one and that is it. i wish it functioned more like the youtube app. other than that its great, but that is why i rate it 3 stars."
1429,14,incredible device for the money.  i have purchased several of these (4) and highly recommend them to anyone that likes a useful ai tool in their house.  listening via the mic does not bother me as the advantages outweigh whatever conspiracy people are out there. i would say this rivals the invention of the smart-phone.
1430,9,excited to begin playing with alexa. i¡¯m still learning the ropes but i¡¯m very pleased so far. i¡¯ve used my oldest son is when visiting with him. bought an extra one for my youngest son.  i think he will enjoy it too.
1431,14,i  ordered this echo primarily  to listen to iheart radio.  the alexa app does not  recognize  the voice commands and repeatedly goes to the wrong station  i have tried various ways to make the request but the app always gets it wrong and have to listen with my phone.
1432,14,"i have one of the old echos and 5 echo dots. i decided to buy one of these new ones since the sound quality was supposedly better. although you can hear some more bass in some songs, it is not worth the upgrade. additionally, this particular echo seems to have many firmware bugs. when i tell alexa to play music, she starts for one second, and then stops."
1433,14,"amazing sound, still learn something new every day!  i ordered a day late so i did not get the amazing deal that ended on december 31st, but i am still very pleased with the product.  was able to tell me how long it takes to get a perfectly hard-boiled egg and then set a timer for me to ensure that perfection!  actually keeps me company and makes me chuckle at times.  well worth it!"
1434,14,i bought 2 of these after reading the other reviews i was a little concerned with the sound but after setting one up for my granddaughter it was no concern at all. my granddaughter is quadriplegic and this works out to be more than a toy to her but entertainment for all of us. now i am going to start working to install some lights and tv to help her turn them on and off. my son received the second one from me for his christmas he is also impressed on it capability!
1435,11,sound is great.  it downloaded and updated twice in first hour of use and you could actually hear the improvement in audio balance and tone.  much better overall than the smaller dot.
1436,14,"love the concept. still getting used to it. would love a more detailed guide. she does have trouble understanding a decent amount of questions. overall, happy with it. love the gray. it looks great."
1437,14,"good speaker, smaller than my other echo that i got when they first came out. very user friendly to set up and use.the controls on this echo are not as user friendly as my one i already owned. you cannot control the volume from the app, you have to either do it via voice or the buttons on the top of the device.the other complaint that i have about this echo 2nd generation is that as you turn the volume up, the sound becomes distorted, and the bass becomes very cranky on the speaker."
1438,10,"love love love this product. i find i use it all the time. i love listening to music on it, the sound quality is fabulous. i also love putting my lists on it, putting my timers on it, putting my reminders on it, putting my calendar on it, and more. i would highly recommend reading the tips that you get via email to get the full use out of this fabulous product. that only what i recommend i bought several of them for christmas gifts... but after i saw how much fun everybody was having with them i had to get one for myself."
1439,10,"alexa has become one of new best buddies :)  she is like a personal assistant, i use her to set multi timers: for kids activities, cooking etc. , for my shopping list, for playing both pandora and amazon music, for the weather and news in the morning. plus she has some fun features. i loved her so much that i ended up getting 2 echo dots for different rooms of the house."
1440,14,"my first entry into this market, as a tech, i usually wait for the next generation and i was happy with purchase.  i got an echo and a dot, plus several tp-link outlets.  all worked great.  still working on verbal commands, but watched lots of videos, and set everything up within a few minutes, (not counting for having to move furniture to access outlets)."
1441,14,"it is the first time having a device like this at home, mainly bought for playing good quality music, checking weather, traffic and news flash without fiddling with my phone or laptop. everyone is enjoying it so much that it is like having another family member in the living room now. i had a little trouble getting it up running due to the security system in my computer, but amazon customer service guided me through the steps for about 30 min to get it started. since then, it is rocking. the sound quality is amazing. i have not taken it up to the smart home control levels yet, but being able to play josh groban in a crisp, space filling music is a good enough reason for me to have this echo!"
1442,14,"this is the first echo i have owned so i cannot comment on the first generation. i will say that i love this thing. it does everything i want it too. unlike some reviewers have stated, i think the sound is really good. the only reason i have knocked off a star is due to the fact that i have an amazon unlimited subscription and everytime i try to listen to it through my echo, the music plays for 5 sec then pauses for 15 sec all the time. now that could just be my crap internet (which is getting upgraded soon) so who knows if it is the device itself or not. it could also be amazon music servers. either way i would recommend this to anyone i spoke with about it."
1443,10,its a clear winner..i am listening to it now..wakes me up in the morning..reminds me of appointments..etc..weather..plays my amazon music..my xm music..i can not figure out why i waited so long..lol..easy setup..just load the app from the mac store..or google store..set up your links and your on your way..
1444,14,"love this unit. sounds better then the 1st gen.prettier too buy gave up the volume ring for looks. in addition to the ring the home wide broadcast command ""everywhere"" confuses echo; i wind up hearing a song called everywhere.  i also wish there was a polite button to she would function properly when hearing thank you and please. i feel rude. :)"
1445,14,"seems like whenever a great new product is introduced (echo) they seem to miss the boat.......in this case i cannot play any of my itunes playlist or streaming radios stations unless they are from amazon from my iphone, laptop or desktop using 2 echos or echo and dot for a fuller stereo like sound.....they need to incorporate itunes and streaming stations into the equation....having 2 speakers instead of 1 ....for a fuller better sound quality ( would sound close to an expensive bose system....would be a definite home run for amazon if they could do that.....get on it boys.....i may even buy amazon stock if you do....."
1446,10,"i¡¯ve been procrastinating buying one of these things. do i need it? what to do with it? well, i have it in my kitchen and i love it. i use alexa as a timer for cooking and baking, morning weather reports and music! sound is very good. i can even give alexa instructions from my loving room and she hears me! my husband was amazed!"
1447,11,the 2nd generation echo is all anyone could expect. alexa updated the firmware after initial activation which improved the sound considerably. the treble and bass are great for such a small system. i have two echo dots and decided i wanted an echo for my collection. i highly recommend this unit if you are seeking a nice all in one system.
1448,0,i love my echo! it does not always know what i¡¯m talking about though. i can not imagine my life without it... at least for now. i named it echo but i¡¯d name it a dude name if i could.
1449,14,"love alexa... stop asking you do not pay for a service, buy alexa and do everything we use grocery list across family, play music from music unlimited which cost $4 and you will never find a song she can not play. but she will play music with music unlimited. we have three of these and use as an intercom system which those cost a lot."
1450,14,"so far my wife and i have only been using the echo for basic things.  like setting a timer, or asking it to remind us to do something.  we have listened to some music on it, and it does a good job of that.  sound quality is what you would expect from a small speaker.  we hope to get a smart plug or two to control a lamp or two in the future.  my wife has also asked it about the weather.  i even got it to sing happy birthday the other day on a friends birthday, although it will not insert the person is name into the song.  i think as time goes on we will find other uses for it.  i gave it 4 stars because it is  still has room to improve, ofcourse that could be us not using it to its potential."
1451,14,"received this as a gift (12/25/2017) and immediately subscribed to umufe. it will likely have more uses as learning (which is not yet well facilitated by azn) goes on. perhaps something like the ipod manual (instruction book) [sold separately, of course] of 2007 will be developed (""echo for dummies"" ?).sorry, i do not know the ""product is web address.""  should i?"
1452,10,"we bought the echo show and the echo 2nd gen.  the show goes in the kitchen and love it for recipies and music. the other unit goes in master bathroom and while i am getting ready for work each morning, i check the weather, make lists of things to do, call people from my contacts list, etc, i love to multitask and this really helps!"
1453,0,love the idea and the ease of talking to her. love the ability to set multiple timers for different things.  she sometimes admits she does not know the answer to some things and can not always search the internet and read off all she found. just hard when our phones are at our fingertips and siri is so intuitive.
1454,10,"it can hear us so clearly, it is almost unsettling! i do not have to shout over the music when i want it to lower the volume. we mostly use it for music and weather updates since we really have not taken the time to discover all the functions. although, it did once tell a joke that absolutely made no sense. still working out how it works. best sound quality i have heard in a while!"
1455,10,"works beautifully and really excellent sound. i am just beginning to learn all of capabilities. i start off each morning asking alexa to play whatever music i am in the mood for - broadway, rock, christmas, sinatra. she has it all, plus the weather report! and she never complains."
1456,10,"amazon echo is amazing. i love music, and have it on all the time. amazon music has a wide variety of playlists, and i like a wide variety of genres. it is fun to have the weather forecast always available, and i am looking forward to doing my amazon shopping by voice rather than keyboard. the tutorial emails are very helpful."
1457,14,"my son and i fight over alexa.  the only con is the lower volume button doesnt seem to work and sometimes alexa doesnt adjust the volume when we ask her to. thats the only reason i am only giving it 4 stars.  we wouldnt let you take alexa from our home if you tried.  we bought a ""used"" one that was $25-30 cheaper than a new one.  the only thing i can imagine is someone bought it and changed their mind and sent it back.  it looked brand new to me."
1458,11,the new echo is awesome.  i waited to purchase one for quite awhile and i am glad i did as i understand the sound quality improved.  the small speaker is great.  the echo stays on our kitchen counter and the speaker plays decent quality music that can be heard in the living and dining rooms.  very quality sound for a small speaker.
1459,14,"this thing is great, i am still learning.  set up was not easy for me.  seems like everyone else just breezed through and they were finished in 10 minutes or less.  i guess i fought it and being 80 years old probably did not help.  i installed a new modem and router and it still took about a week to lock it in.  i think i just aggravated it so much that it gave up and connected on its own.  i also connected two dots.  they did not take as long, but did not exactly just fall in that easy.  if you have a problem, do not give up nor listen to the guys that tell you how easy it is."
1460,11,love this 2nd generation. can not really tell a difference in the sound. however like the fact it is shorter and packs the same sound as the basic echo. aldo designer cover is a nice touch. good job
1461,0,"i love that i can request songs and turn lights on and off. alexa is learning my household more and more. sometimes she does not get my command right, and when she shuffles a playlist she repeats songs while skipping others."
1462,10,"amazing device. very sturdily built, and looks good too. has amazing sound - as good or better than my old bose system. but the functionality is amazing - streaming music, news briefings, timers/alarms, stock quotes, ingredients for a bourbon manhattan! i love echo and alexa - most amazing technology i have run across in the last 10 years."
1463,14,"every so often, while playing music from my amazon library the echo stops. i use all my devices for playing music via whole house use. the echo is the only one that exhibits this tendency. the sound is better than the dit, but not quite as good as the show. all in all i am happy with the echo, but the music issue is annoying."
1464,10,"echo has changed the way we track many things in our household! shopping lists, to-do lists, timers for cooking, bedtimes, etc. are all now done by the sound of our voice. echo family trivia night has become a favorite for everyone as well!with echo plus two echo dots, we can easily communicate from upstairs to the basement or play music through the whole house!the only downside is that we can never watch another movie or tv show with a character named, ""alexa"" or anything close to it."
1465,14,"it refuses to properly pair with a bluetooth speaker.  i have tried multiple bluetooth speakers at various distances but it will not continually connect.  the amazon customer support was garbage as their only suggestion was i permanently use an aux cable and reset the device.  as a stand alone unit it is fine but if you are hoping to use it with a blue tooth speaker, look elsewhere.  this thing sucks. i do not understand how in 2018 a company as big as amazon can make a device that is unable to connect to a bluetooth speaker is completely beyond me.  get a google home"
1466,14,the sound was much better than expected. really blew me away with the level of bass and quality of the sound. alexa u understands me very well and is almost instant in responding and completing my requests properly. lots of nifty stuff she can do at base. but the things she can not do that you download the apps for is what kinda is a missed thing. the apps are bad there barely work and that really sucks. this is a really great product but not perfect. i hope there will improve more. if you want something to make your life easier and more comfortable then here you go she is a good bet.
1467,14,"there are some things - reasonable things - it can not do, but that list is short. it gets confused when you ask how many reminders it will accommodate. i use it all the time for reminders, and it is wonderful. you can even set reminders for other days at certain times. and the reminders can appear on your phone!"
1468,14,i thought the echo is could run without being plugged into an outlet.  i am a little disappointed that it does not.  if it does mine must be messed up because it will not work without being plugged up.  with all the technology now i would have thought that this would have been a given on the echo.  everything else i have similar charges and you can move it around to use without the plug.  amazon needs to get with the program on this feature. if anyone knows anything different please let me know.
1469,14,"hi, i have recently got one of these as a gift. i have no problems with the product whatsoever, but it would be rather pleasing if the echo had more language options. in my case when i was setting it up, it did not have the option of spanish built in so i had to set it up in english, there was no problem. however when i request songs in spanish it does not recognize any words and alexa has a bad time understanding the titles of the songs.overall great product but wish it came with more language options."
1470,14,"i received the echo as a gift and i absolutely love it. i use it on daily basis. in the morning i simply say, ""alexa good morning"" and alexa will respond with my pre selected 'skills'  (cnn news brief, local weather and the subreddit of the day). you can choose from 100s of skills and customize your alexa however you would like. for entertainment alexa can play games like jeopardy or 20 questions, as well as play music on command through amazon music, spotify, etc. i personally use apple music so i simply connect alexa through bluetooth and play the music on my iphone or macbook, the one single speaker is enough to play music throughout my 2 bedroom home loud and clear. alexa has 100s of skills and is been developed more and more weekly. i would highly recommend the amazon echo."
1471,9,"i love alexa she is fun and helpful. i wish she could understand more. but overall my family loves her and loves playing games, music and my 2 year old is obsessed with the bedtime stories. my husband loves the gordon ramsey and my mom and i love getting music on command. the small speaker puts out big noise, great bass. perfect for entertaining."
1472,11,"i love alexa, but generation 2 is a step backwards.  the sound quality is worse and the microphones are terrible.  we love the drop in feature on alexa, but it does not work with gen 2 due to muffled sound."
1473,11,"i love the echo devices.  i have two of the original echo and two dots.  this is much prettier, and smaller, than the original echo.  still really easy to use - has great sound."
1474,14,enjoying this new fun device. and it does work on our hotspot. great for rural people who do not have true wifi available. could not get google home to work. echo not only work was very easy to set up.
1475,14,this will be a long review. first of all i am not new to amazon echo. i have had one for 3 years. well i decided to upgrade to 2nd generation echo. hooked everything up. went into the alexa app and linked my echo to my fire tv 2nd generation. now everything worked except it would not launch my netflix/ hulu for example. the funny thing is when i was watching a movie on netflix i could pause and resume movie with alexa. it just would not launch the app. was on the phone for 3 hours with techs. they came on transferring me to a fire tv tech. i new it was not my fire tv because i also have an echo dot. so i connected my echo dot with the same fire tv unlinked my echo and linked my echo dot. everything worked perfectly. so it has to be my new echo with issues. they had me try everything but nothing worked. even one tech said i just need to use the remote control. reall??!!! i am suppose to be able to control my fire tv hands free. anyway i believe the echo is broke. so i will return. very frustrated!!!
1476,14,"it is truly a great concept and so far, decent execution.  i placed 3 stars due to the limitations.  say it can connect to my lg 65"", it does not.  claims to control my nest thermostat, not easy due the the specific commands required.  humans, we have many ways of communicating one phrase.  alexa must learn them all, not us limiting our language."
1477,11,"i love this!  very easy set up.  working great and i am very happy with the sound (which many are complaining about).  granted, it is not on the same level as my bose system but for a unit of this size the music sounds great.  it is convenient, fun and a steal at the sale price of $79."
1478,10,i love being able to ask alexa questions and to check the weather in different locations. love being able to ask for music and boom its available. easy set up and we are enjoying it.
1479,14,"i got this for my wife for music streaming, thinking we would have it unplugged most of the time when not actively in use.  did not work out that way.  it is on all the time for random dumb questions or for a quick check of the weather or to set a cooking timer or for a dictionary question or ...  i am surprised that we like it so much.  we bought an echo and a dot as part of a package deal, and might buy another echo for the office."
1480,10,"i love my echo! it is so convenient and helpful, not to mention fun! i love getting instant weather updates with out lifting a finger. flash news briefings are great, i love how you can pick your own news topics for alexa to share.  my 10 year old loves to learn new jokes alexa gives him. i am very happy with my decision to get one and now i may invest in an echo dot to compliment the echo. no regrets here!"
1481,10,"we love our echo!! ended up getting the dots too.. everybody that comes over wants to ask it stuff...!!! very easy set up, and you can disable any of the apps, disabled the shopping app..:) ... you can ask for recipes, music, directions, etc.."
1482,10,"i love my echo. it was a christmas gift to myself and i love that i can use it for just about everything. makes living life hands free so easy! my fav feature is being able to ""drop in"" on members of my family outside of my home that also have an echo. my parents are 3200 miles away and i can just drop in and check on them and that is awesome!!!!"
1483,0,live the device! very useful in responding to most of my questions and commands. love the sound quality. the only thing that i do/did not like is: at times i would have to reconnect to wifi!
1484,0,"i do like the echo, i just do not think it was/is worth the money.  my 5 year old son likes it more than i do.  i considered returning it but he has insisted we keep it.  it is fun to play with but not something i think i will use very often.  if you are buying this to play music, it will not play anything unless you link another music account or have a subscription to prime or music unlimited.  alexa sometimes does not respond when i clearly ask a question and often does not answer correctly which is frustrating."
1485,14,"i received the 2nd generation echo for my birthday at the beginning of february, and so far, i am loving it! i use it for my alarm clock in the morning now because is uses a sound that is way more gentle and soothing than my iphone alarm. it answers a lot of basic questions which i played around with in the beginning, but i typically just use it to listen to the news in the morning and play music while i get ready, and it is been great. i like the volume that it gets to, and i like being able to move it around my house to where i need it. so far, loving it. the only thing that i would be careful about is a lot of the time you have to say really specific vocal commands for alexa to understand. however, i have not found it to be too much of an inconvenience."
1486,11,"echo has been part of our household for the last three years, and could only be happier with a 2nd generation echo! what is amazing about this device is the vastly improved speech recognition."
1487,14,"we are finding these (we have two) an excellent addition to our home. seamlessly connects with pandora and radio stations we listen to. the sound is pretty good, though obviously not up to the quality of my home stereo systems. but we use them more because they are so convenient. kinda' wish alexa had full use of google searches because some questions do not already have answers in the amazon database. but generally fine for most quick questions we ask."
1488,9,i initially bought this to use as an intercome system for the house.  mainly between the upstairs den and the man cave. great sound when playing music.  still learning all of its used. i use the shopping list feature all the time.  i plan to get the smart light bulbs to try for one or two room.  i like this idea over the plugs.
1489,14,great value for $99 - sounds excellent after recent update.
1490,14,"i love the 2nd gen echo. speakers get super loud and the commands it can do are endless. just like any ai it does require setup, time and making sure things are configured properly. once that is done alexa works amazing. it even knows a spinal tap reference - say ""alexa turn the volume to 11"" and it will go as loud as it can go :)"
1491,9,alexa is amazing. i¡¯m so glad i bought this. our house is full of so much more music and less tv. the sound quality is really good. i have not ordered anything through alexa yet. we enjoy the ability to control lights and play jeopardy. my 4 year old loves the fart feature. if you¡¯re thinking about it just do it. you will not be disappointed.
1492,14,"originally i bought this and several dots as a cheap alternative to a whole-house stereo system. the sound quality of the echo is great and we love having music in every room. but more than that, we¡¯ve found alexa a very useful tool for getting the news and weather, setting reminders, and playing a nightly round of jeopardy together. a great device!"
1493,14,"i received this as a christmas gift. i still have a lot to learn, but what i have learned to do with it so far has me excited. it is fascinating that it will update features and functions over time. i just need to find the time to add more apps to it!"
1494,14,of course the kids love this. amazon should consider the echo silver option from snl because my husband calls the wrong name all the time and is confused when it does not respond.
1495,14,"i was hesitant to order the new echo because of some negative reviews but thought i would give it a go. (can not please everybody, right?)  glad i did.  it is a powerhouse in a little package!  so convenient to get general info as well as whatever music you want without having to handle a smartphone.love it!!!"
1496,7,since the updates i think it sounds good and is very useful <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+008e>
1497,14,"sound is good on this one but it has problems hearing you from across the room.  the smaller dot could pick up speech must better.  do not waste your money, you have to scream at this one for it to do anything.  it is supposed to be able to pick up your voice and commands even in a noisy room, this one doesnt...they need a software upgrade to fix this is something."
1498,14,"i love my echos! i have the echo and several dots. i have given them to everyone in my family as gifts over the last few years and they love them too! i usually give them a automated device to get them started. either a light bulb, plug, or switch. my brother has since automated his entire house. it is fun when people come over and they see you use it with just your voice and they are mine is blown when they see the professional lighting that you setup in just a couple hours over your weekend. they keep setting up more options. these devices, in just a few years, has made home automation and entertainment so easy and affordable."
1499,0,really loved this for the few months it worked well. now it just pauses while playing music all the time. or she randomly says ¡®something went wrong¡¯ i do not know what is going on but really hope amazon gets this fixed :(
1500,14,"love the convenience!  the voice recognition is amazing and alexa has lots of good things to say. the greatest shortcoming is the sound. it is somewhat muffled and bass-boomy. the only place i can put the unit is in a counter-top corner, and that re-enforces the ¡°boom.¡± i¡¯ve tried instructing alexa to ¡°lower bass¡± or ¡°turn up treble¡±, and that works for a while but does not stick. why not have a real tone control (or better, an equalizer) built in to the alexa app that would work all the time?  one other nit: i would like my ¡°flash brief¡± to greet me with the usual trivia bit, then give the forecast, and then read the day is calendar events. i do not see any way to do this.overall, though, i love the device. it is a lot of fun!"
1501,11,"not an upgrade. the sound is very tinny in the second generation. very disappointed. if it were not for the marketing, stating better sound, i would not have been this let down. but it is bad compared to gen 1."
1502,14,"after a lot of research and shopping around i believe the echo to be the best smart assistant catalyst for alexa, which i believe to be the best smart assistant. i bought my echo 2 and echo dot for $115 at meijer.i think the echo 2 sounds great for what it is and the dot is nice to have though it has no where near the power of the echo 2. but it is reasonably loud and clear with no noticeable distortion as well as being responsive and snappy.one product i would like to see would be an echo tower that could have a built in hub for smart devices. help stream line the setup of ¡°the smart home¡± and have good audio power for a home system."
1503,10,this is a fantastic product.  we ask for a song and in seconds it plays it.  my wife tell it to put items on her grocery list and it does.  when she is ready to shop i can print off the list from  amazon.  it also is great when used as a reminder or alarm.highly recommended.  i am sure that i do not know everything there is to know.
1504,14,works great out of the box. simple to set up. i wish it was easier to set up multiple profiles however. it can be done but not so simply.the sound quality of this unit is superb. i am pleasantly surprised at the deep bass it produces.
1505,11,"sounds great upgrading from echo dot. i have not noticed any of the sound issues that many of the early adopters complained about so i guess the software updates fixed it. sounds much better than the dot, i never had a full size echo before. i typically used a small bluetooth speaker with the dot, and with this i do not need to."
1506,10,"i got this for my husband for xmas and he thought it was a bit unnecessary at first but now we can not imagine not having it! the news in the morning, podcast while i am doing sishes, questions at dinner, and music thru the day- all without ever having to touch the machine! we love it!! our kids are obsessed- great price too!"
1507,14,"wonderful and loud sound.  echo is in general are great for home automation which i am using with philips hue stuff.  alexa for the most part is great, but still some things she does not know how to answer.  i have a google home mini, which complements this well.  awesome purchase when echo was on sale for $79, which i also got a dot at the same time."
1508,10,"so much fun! i use the echo and dot for to do lists, timers, music, ask stupid stuff!! i think the to do lists are the best. bought a dot for my office and use it for my work to do list constantly. alexa does a great job of recognizing my voice and getting the commands correct. the sound out of the echo is great for music. fun device and a must have!!"
1509,14,much better form factor. the sound is only a little better and might not be noticible by all. still the sound is excellent. this is a nice addition for anyone that has an alexa and wants to add rooms to playing music on groups of devices. we switched from spotify to amazon music unlimited in addition to adding this and we love it.
1510,14,"i love my echo.  the sound quality and aesthetic value are extremely pleasing.  i often pair to my bose speakers when i am working or meandering around the house.  when alexa wakes me up i get my briefings for the day, then i am ready to start my day.  i have not tapped into alexa capabilities, but i love not having to press buttons...i just ask and she usually delivers."
1511,10,"absolutely love this.  i use it several times a day.  i have connected lights in multiple rooms which is awesome.  i listen to news, weather, music, create shopping lists and get general information to help the kids with homework.  simply mind blowing.  i highly recommend this. easy to use, plug and play!!"
1512,14,"i really lime the way she controls all my smart home devices. i am giving her 4 stars because she has a hard time understanding my voice. when she does though she is awsome. so i bought a dot to place closer to me. between the two they work very well together. i have the dot right next to the ""dad"" spot in the living room, now she here is everything i say and i have them linked together.  works great."
1513,14,"i am enjoying everything about this.  it arrived in good condition, was packaged nicely and was very easy to setup.  it works flawlessly and alexsa has become one of my best friends.  she gives me the weather, any kind of music i ask for, and the sound is great quality.  i also was impressed by the interchangeable cover that is of excellent quality and gives it a very professional appearance.  a very good purchase in all respects!"
1514,14,"i love my echo! the sound is wonderful! as a bass player, i have to say i am extremely impressed with the bass response in the echo! for such a small device, it puts out a huge sound! add to that the functionality and usefulness of alexa, and you have a tremendous value for the price! i had heard the sound quality in an echo thanks to a friend, and since i kept talking about it and talking about it, my girlfriend got me mine for christmas! honestly? best christmas gift ever!!!"
1515,0,"i like that alexa does what i say.  when we go out we always put some music on for our dogs.  sometimes it is a hunt to find the right music station, but now i just say alexa play smooth jazz.  tell me a joke or what is the weather today?  when she flashes green, i have a notification from amazon that my order is on its way.  what is not to like?  a friend that is there for you, keeps you updated on news, weather, tells you joke and let is you know when your items are coming, and she asked nothing of you.  keep learning alexa and show us what you can do!"
1516,14,"i love the sound from this device! also the 7 microphones help out a lot and are very noticeable on this one, than the first generation echo. she picks up every command on the second generation and produces a sound better and on par with the first gen. also the the second gen has different choices to chose from, i love my grey echo fiber because it looks nice in my room. the size on this thing is smaller than the first gen, however it has more weight. i love the second gen echo, i loved it so much i bought another one on sale for my girlfriend so she can feel the experience and she loves it. hands down one of the best smart home devices on the market. i heard some bad things about google and apples home pod. i highly recommend this device!"
1517,11,"awesome! who needs sonos? after two bad experieces with sonos this echo did the job with room to spare. the bass is excellent, the voices sound really good and the response from alexa is fast and reliable. i already bought my second unit."
1518,14,"great product, was leery about getting one with all the negative reviews but the bugs are fixed. i can not hear my 1st generation dot play music while i¡¯m in the shower or having other stuff on well bec it is so underpowered (not so stylish either) so i pulled the trigger and got a second gen echo and i am very impressed. the sound bugs everyone is complaining about are not there once it updates and reboots itself upon set up.the sound quality is much better than the 1st gen dot however a little less than the echo. i own 1 first gen dot and two echos and this has 50% increased in volume from the original little echo and is a legitimate music player. it is a little less basey and clear than the 1st gen original echo in side by side comparison but not too noticeable where it¡¯d really matter because it is still half the price and looks waaaay better. that is the second best thing is the style really is something that looks premium and high quality and blends into any space. with the selection of colors it is a great option for any room or environment and fits better than the 1st gen dot or echo and is not an eye sore.i¡¯m definitely buying another soon for $79 that is a great deal and the performance it gives in comparison to the echo is worth the price especially with how much more eye friendly and stylish it is.pros: 1) price,2) far louder and better sound than 1st gen dot3) sound quality is great, bugs are fixed4) very stylish and looks greatcons:1) little less crisp, clear and basey than the original echoopinion: this is a great investment. it is waaay better than the original dot. it is a legitimate speaker and great for bedroom or living room, especially in an apartment or smaller room it will fill it up. however, i¡¯d invest in an echo or even better, a designated speaker designed for music if your looking something exclusively for music for a larger space or for those who want a premium quality for listening as bose/other brands have better sound playing devices for $100 price range and then just use the dot/echo for your lights, information and commands."
1519,10,"i love it. i bought it mostly for music, and the speaker in this works really great, but i also love that i can ask it the weather, use it to set timers and alarms, and apparently ""drop in on grandma"" for phone calls. i have not used it to purchase anything, but i have no regrets in the purchase."
1520,14,"i was surprised by how great this sounds! i chose this over the dot because i did not want to have to hook speakers up for it. so glad i did. it was easy to set up, and now i just say ""alexa"" and play music, books, news, weather, set an alarm, you name it. i think this would be a great gift for anyone."
1521,14,"the echo has been so much fun. alexa can run the gambit of services for you from ordering merchandise to cranking up your roomba robot. i say well done echo. at night it is so relaxing to listen to "" distant thunderstorms, with thunder in the distance and a gentle rain falling. what a way to relax and fall asleep. we have had great fun with alexa is jokes, weather reports, and tidbits of info she pulls off the internet in a moments notice. i have both the echo and echo dot and have really come to enjoy the service they provide."
1522,14,"fun kind of electronic item to have around,  the amazon app  alexa that you use with it is very poor.  most of the time when you click on settings the app just sits there with 3 blinking dots and goes nowhere for days.  the echo however is fun to have around and amazingly up to date with information."
1523,14,"beautiful design!! love my alexa, has all the answers also very convenient.  never thought i have a use for it but since i got it we use it all the time.  make life easier.  my favorite skill is the alarm clock just say when you want to be woke and bam its done.  no more hassle with setting a alarm.  i know thats a simple skill and you say your phone can do that but if you are a heavy sleeper like my self you dont hear your phone but alexa, omg, so much louder even wakes the dead my wife says.  lol"
1524,11,"nothing more amazing than this echo, is perfect, the size, and the most important, the quality of the sound, nothing to compete with bose, is really really really good audio. 5 start. best product purchased in christmas. recommended"
1525,11,this is my 2nd echo 2nd generation. i returned the first one due to numerous issues. now i know why the 2nd gen is cheaper. it does not function as well as my first one from almost a year ago( 1st gen). i do agree the newer 2nd gen does have improved sound. i also purchased 2 echo dots 2nd gen. can not complain at $30. i do suggest using a better speaker system. until improvement on the echo are made this will be my last one.
1526,11,the gen 1 echo has better sound and bass response than this new gen 2 echo. not sure why amazon says the newest version has better sound. it doesnt.great replacement for a dot though.
1527,14,"i bought this at best buy and i love it. i mostly needed a good speaker to fill the kitchen and living room while cleaning my apartment. but i find a new use for it everyday. from shopping list to reminders , to asking what time the closest liquor store closes ...sky net,uh alexa is one of my new best friends!"
1528,14,i have been having fun with these. i bought 4 and enjoy listening to music throughout the house instead of spending a fortune on wireless speakers. sound is good but not great at loud volume.
1529,11,"i was not sure what to expect with some of the reviews i read saying this version has bad sound. but having used this for some time now and comparing it to the previous version, i think this new version is far better sounding than the previous version. it is been fun to play with. i think it is worth the money."
1530,14,"initial feedback is it will keep your 8 and 10 year olds busy...homework questions, music, who is who, trivia, and they even use it when they are fighting...i.e. alexa.. is ethan a dummy??? alexa pleads the 5th......alexa is abbie a poophead?.....alexa-i cant answer that? i will be linking her to my smart home and we will have updated feedback later."
1531,11,"better bass than the original. can not really tell a difference if the mic is better or not. i preferred the ring style volume over the buttons, but hey it works great otherwise."
1532,14,"set up was a breeze with alexa app and it is a great resource and a fun device. sound is very good for speech, not much bass for music, but very clear. i am having fun learning everything that the echo can do. have set up several smart plugs for lights and entertainment. not too complicated once the plugs are discovered and named."
1533,14,"alexa, how do you spell happiness?  e c h o.  i love my echo, and so do my grandkids.  we try to ask alexa a different quiz every day, sometimes they get a little weird but she seems to do her best.  sound from the echo is good, have not added any speakers to it, do not need them.  i do have a small place."
1534,14,got this for my daughter. i have a couple of dots at home myself. daughter says it is a nice product but concern of the privacy portion and claims it goes on talking on it is own. might be best to turn mic off at night and when not in use. i am having the same issues. dots just start talking on its own.
1535,14,"alexa is very intelligent but needs work on the sound. both this one ""echo"" and ""echo plus"" are sadly putting out lousy sound quality as far as music. the google home is better but not a slam dunk. my solution and suggestion is configure a secondary/primary bluetooth speaker. if you have one then you are set. if not go out and buy one. pair it through the app on amazon and it can send all transmitted audio to the bluetooth speaker instead of the crummy one built into the echo(s)also look for 3rd party solutions like sonos. some use google assistant and others us amazon alexa. good luck!"
1536,0,"i really like the device. it keeps me entertained and i hope it will become more useful in the future as i integrate a smart home system. so far it has done a lot in answering questions, i just think it should pull its information from a different source than wikipedia (it not the most reliable source).."
1537,14,"the directions for this sophisticated and complicated device are abominable. but, the real issue is why. the echo at this price should be self-starting and able to connect to any wifi automatically. i would urge people who are not nerds and computer gurus to avoid this product. amazon is tech team should be ashamed of itself."
1538,14,i have 7 of them ....that should tell you something!  i have two of them paired on each side of my easy chair for a much better music experience than just one.  i use them as a whole house intercom system as well as answering the phone hands free.  i wish they would come out with ones that also have built in wi-fi extending each echo is range... a complete system of paired  a-i-wi-fi  that would be the next logical step.
1539,14,i have had the echo dot for about a year and love it.  this is much simpler because i do not have to turn an external speaker on and off and make sure it is charged properly...
1540,14,well this is a great device alexa i love it what a bunch of cry babies on here reading all the reviews you would never buy it but it works great for me and my friend bought one and she loves it too the only thing that would be improved would be to have search capabilities such as google on questions that she cannot answer
1541,14,playing music on demand. what i do not like is having to prompt alexa to respond three different times to get my request of any action. she says most often she does not understand and to try later. i have already exchanged on echo that did the same thing. i have tested my wi fi signal at the echo location and it is rated fast at 20 to 30 mbps. so i will deal with it.
1542,10,this is absolutely amazing i go to sleep with my thunder storms sounds and wake up to the alarm altho i  have not been able to make my alarm play anything but what i suppose comes with it in memory. not be able to make it play alarm at full sound. so its difficult to hear the alarm . but we love the echo
1543,14,"my family and i are enjoying and learning this gadget.  some things it does with ease, other commands do not take right away.  i¡¯ve purchased the element wifi  hub and bulbs and am having a ball connecting and controlling lights.  i want to get an echo dot to connect with a wifi camera and thermostat next."
1544,10,i really love it so far i have not explored all the features but it is a really cool device it hears me and my kids call its name from all the way across the house even while music is playing
1545,0,"i like this more than i thought. i do not really need it, but it is fun and it keeps the old lady here, mentally active trying to remember the commands for skills. lol."
1546,14,"i love having alexa around to tell me the weather, to turn lights on and off and to answer my questions.  she can order me an uber ride, a pizza or perform many other tasks, as well as play my favorite music with great sound.  she can be funny and actually a little smart- alec-y at times, but that just adds to the enjoyment."
1547,0,"it has been a big hit in our house.  we use it mostly to play music, and the fun part of it is how easy it is to play songs we have not heard in years.  the sound is very good, and responds to most of our commands. however, i was surprised when i asked it to play dixieland jazz, and it no idea what i was asking for. eventually, it tried to play some soft jazz, that clearly was not dixieland.  still, a lot of fun to have in the house."
1548,10,"i love this thing. plays music, sings for me, tells me jokes (gosh i need a life). haha but it connects to my lights, tells me the weather/news. so many things it can do."
1549,14,this speaker at $79 is an absolute steal.  good to great sound with the function of alexa.  sound carries through the entire house.  bigger than a dot but you can still hide it out of sight.
1550,14,"prosvery good speaker quality and i love the way this links to amazon. cons are that i bought it for my father to have the ability to order things he needs but he stutters and alexa does not wait for him to finish he did much better with the google assistant. also, alexa does not know much. we get more answers from the web with google."
1551,14,"the echo is always changing and adding new features. i personally like asking a lot of random questions (shower thoughts), and the alexa continues to learn and able to answer more questions. the voice recognition is amazing. i will be walking towards my bedroom with both hands full, and with my wifi light switch, the echo can pick up my command to turn my lights on from 25+ feet away. i also us the echo as a bluetooth connection to my stereo with it plugged in via aux cord. no more being tethered."
1552,14,"when in group mode, the music is out of sync with the other echo dot."
1553,10,"so easy to set up, links to my amazon echo app on my phone effortlessly, lots of fun games yes sire is a favorite. can read audible books to you outloud, keep to do lists, so much more !"
1554,14,i got one to try and found it a cool gadget . so i got another one in 24 hours for my lady . now i thought of giving one as a gift . its to bad you  cant get a $50 incentive credit if i purchase a third one at a later date  . i ready did not think of buying 3 all at once with a chance of not enjoying it and have to return all 3 . seemed like a risky expense. i am happy with it though.
1555,14,"does not seem to have the same stability as the old echo dot. looses connections more often than i would like. good sound though, which is why i bought it. play all of my music through it."
1556,14,"having owned two echo dots, my wife and i decided to purchase this item to replace the dot in our kitchen and give the sound there a boost. the echo has not let us down!"
1557,14,"bought this so i could access pandora.  it does that and much more.  it is a stereo the size of a tall soup can.  surprisingly strong speaker too.  not tinny, really great volume."
1558,9,i like the new echo.  i use this one downstairs and i use my 1st generation echo upstairs.  it is a real convenience to have them in both locations. the sound on the 2nd echo sounds great too!
1559,14,"it is great!  my first experience with a voice assistance of this caliber.  without being super wordy, i would rate this higher if i could choose the wake-up word.  my only complaint is that it does activate often when i am not in the room due to the way sound bounces around.  it always shuts off, but that does not help my wife from thinking everyone in the world is constantly listening in."
1560,10,"i bought this echo for my kitchen to listen to music...  nice sound.  also you can ask it all kinds of questions. have an on going grocery list, set reminders... just have paper and pen ready when you retrieve you grocery list. it said it once, and then told me the list was empty!!! i had to remember everything i had put on it!!!!"
1561,14,"after the software upgrade i do like the bose sound. however, at first when i i was researching whether to buy  the echo 2nd generation  i read the review about the the volume difference between volume 1 and volume 2.  i thought the critique was quite picky. now i have the echo 2nd generation on my nightstand and i can tell you it is a huge irritant that should be fixed, hopefully through software upgrades.  so one is left  to set volumes i.e. volumes 1 - 10.  herein is the rub!  volume 1 is so low it is completely unintelligible  and cannot be heard while volume 2 is entirely too loud for trying to go to sleep or reading. the volume ring is gone  so now  you have to try to find the volume up and volume down buttons on the top  and this often  in dim light.  for discriminating listeners this is easily apparent.  if you are only getting weather reports, making shopping list, turn lights on, and doing a myriad of other utilitarian  tasks which do not require fine night time or arm chair listening then this volume irritant will go unnoticed. but let this be a warning to others who choose to put it on the nightstand and hope far music to go to sleep by or to even read with. amazon, if you are reading this, please bring up volume 1 a little so that it can be heard and bring down volume 2 so that it is truly in the background. how about this amazon, if you are reading this, allow us to change volume by voice to 1 and 1.5, or volume 2 and 2.5. if there is going to be such a disparity between volume 1 and volume 2 then allow the customer to have a halfway point between each volume."
1562,11,"does as advertised.  i speak from accross any room and it responds.  though the speaker was not ""true high fidelity"", it does sound good at surprising high levels consider it is compact size.  i did have to learn the appropriate phraseology, but it is all good now.  the down side?  not portable."
1563,14,"it was a gift for xmas. oddly it starts to talk on it is own, outta the clear blue, without intentionally being initiated.  annoying. often it just turns on the way it does when it is listening to a direct question, but nobody asked it anything. makes you feel like someone somewhere is listening to our family."
1564,14,"2018-mar-29 revision revision - lost my internet before finished.you can, on the alexa app, delete history, but; you must enter each device, and then each recording, and delete them one by one.  this is slow and very cumbersome.  at the least, i should be able, to select a single device and select delete all.  this is not an option on the alexa app.  i have 5-devices that record.  so consider if i have 5-devices, and each device has 10-to-15-different recordings, that means i have to hit ""delete"" 50-to-75-times before i have deleted all of my so-called history!  if i could do it at the device level, i would only have to do it 5-times.  seriously, deleting recordings is a very difficult thing.and, i am very annoyed at the big glaring red circle on top of each echo, when i mute the microphones!  it really should glow red for perhaps 1-minute, then; very slowly, blink red - where by - it is off for 5-seconds, then slow flash red for 2-seconds, then 5-seconds off, then 2-seconds on.  or something like that.  not that ugly --constant-- red ring on top when ever the microphones are off.  seriously. guys?2018-mar-29 follow on - revised.i still have an issue - but - i must revise my statement.  according to amazon, it does not record unless alexa hears her wake word, and; then you are only going to be recorded for what ""she"" must hear, in order to respond properly to your request.that is what amazon says will happen.  but,it also says you can delete the recordings via the alexa app.  that is not true.  i have the alexa app on my samsung phone, and; there is absolutely no way to delete recordings from that device.  it is not supported there.  moreover, as it appears that i can only delete recordings from my laptop, there is still no feedback that when i ask for my recordings to be deleted, that they are actually deleted.  as i stated before, it says a ""request is acknowledged"" but not actually ""done"".and it says that if you push the microphone button, that it shuts off the microphones on the device.  i am dubious if this is true, and; it is really annoying that it shines red when you do this.  why not shine red for a moment, then blink very slow red, until you turn it on again?  if i want to leave it off, for hours, or even days - i do not want to therefore waste the light - or over time burn the led out.still, when i first reviewed my recordings here, there were several instances where stuff i did not want recorded was actually recorded.  and a lot of crap from my tv, where alexa responded to the tv that was playing, and recorded useless stuff from there.  so, i apologize to amazon for my outburst saying they are recording us, they are, but ""not so much"" as i believed.i am still in doubt, and dubious about delete.  why can i not simply say, ""alexa - delete my recordings.""???********okay, i have a serious issue with the alexa interface.  i just learned, that alexa and my echo devices, are, according to amazon, ""constantly listening"".  okay, i get it.  it has to ""listen"" to know when you are asking it to do things for you.  fine.but, did you also know it is constantly recording?  that is right.  it is not merely listening.  it is also constantly recording everything that is making sound in your home!and, the only way to delete those recordings, is to login to amazon, via a laptop, and manage those recordings.  worse, even when you order them to delete my recordings, it does not do that!  it says, ""your request has been sent""  you never ever get an actual acknowledgement that the recordings are being deleted!there are those who try to draw attention to ""this could be used against you in law enforcement"".i am doing nothing that matters in that regard.  that is not why i care about being recorded all the frakking time!consider the more obvious privacy issues - that have absolutely nothing to do with being illegal or such like:do you want amazon recording you ....  * you reminding the kid(s) of the front door lock code?  * you discussing your private financial facts with your spouse?  * you lecturing your kid about drugs?  * how about you and your mate making love at night?  * that - is why amazon echo recording is bad.  listening?  sure, i get that.  but recording?  and not deleting them easily by saying:  alexa - delete all of my recordings right now!  you can not.  and i, personally, have a serious issue with that.  recording?  that i cannot merely say, ""alexa delete my recordings""?  why not???!!!2017-dec-07 follow onall in all, i like this device.  it plays my amazon music very well, and; the ""daily briefings"" and ""reuters news"" are nice to have.  i hope that as time passes, i will find more things to do.  it is fun to ask alexa things just to see what she ""knows"".  i think amazon should make it more clear where to go to learn more.  perhaps a devoted web page or three.the only thing that is ""funny"" and ""off"", is that i have mine seated near one of my tvs.  and, randomly, when i am watching shows, the sound from the tv activates alexa, and; it is funny to hear her respond to the tv rather than to me.  no complaint about that.  it is impossible for it to not happen.  though it is really funny when it does!the sound quality is outstanding.  and, now i have two of them paired.  they play music very well in sync.  i am a tech, so; it makes me wonder what kind of firmware algorithm is used to make it so perfectly synced.  cudoz to the men and women who made that possible.  i know that it had to be a serious challenge to make it so!if you want a laugh or three, ask alexa to sing and also to tell you stories.;o)2017-nov-22 follow onokay, really, it is a nice device.  it needs more functionality, but; it is overall, a good buy, if you want help with your memory and lists and reminders and such like.  i found that the recurring reminder is there, just not obvious - though - it should be.  search on amazon.  i am working on it now.  as for alexa, for some of us, nice is important.  one glaring oversight...  she does not respond to courtesy.  you folks need to get her to respond to ""thank you alexa"" with ""you are welcome."" or better, ""you are welcome roger."" or ""you are very welcome!""  and best, a combination of either response - or even all three of them, randomly, whenever the user says, ""thanks alexa"" or ""thank you alexa"". or even just ""thank you"" and ""thanks"".  it should be no issue for it to recognize at nice thank you and reply.  the ability to do so would add to the illusion that alexa is your ""friendly helper"".  food for thought.---------------------------------------------------(original posting)this is my initial thoughts only.  i am still getting to know this device.  so far, the pro(s) are, it is smaller than i thought it would be, which is nice.  and, the sound quality is fabulous!  it plays my amazon prime music very nicely.  alexa responds very well to my voice without any special ""training"", from 10-feet away across the room.  i do not have to ""yell at it"" or anything.  just speak to her normally.  that is really nice.  and, the alexa voice is easy to understand, and; well programmed to reply.con(s), though only minor:  i had to eject then, remove the sd-card, and also reboot my phone, to get the alexa app to install on my note 4 running droid 4.4.4.  before doing that, i wasted nearly an hour trying over, and over, to download and install the app.  it downloaded fine, but; refused to install.  and on every failed install, it would ""claim"" it could not download.  my download manager showed clearly that it was downloading fine.frankly, i do not like that i must use my phone to ""configure"" and ""modify"" the settings for this device.  that was not clear online.  i would think amazon would also supply me with a windows application for this.  but, so far, i cannot find one.  seriously, it would be nice to not have to use only my phone for the setup and reconfiguration activities.  yes, i know the children do everything on their phones.  but, i am a dinosaur, and i use my laptop far more than my phone for ""things"".  just a thought.the built in activities are rather limited.  it does news only from reuters, and; will not allow me to re-do the news for ""today"".  that is annoying.  i do not always get to catch all of the information on the first pass.  so, it seems that i should be able to re-listen to the same news cast - on demand - all the time.  but, once you have done the news ""today"", alexa says, ""you have already listened to your news"" and refuses to do it again for ""today"".i have not yet done it, but; i like that i can set up the device to remind me of things, ""to-do"", and; also - to put things in my amazon cart, and; also to buy things without being on the laptop, and; to give me order status alerts for amazon purchases.  i look forward to trying these features.bad bad bad is...she does a terrible job of reading my kindle books.  so bad in fact, that; it is not really worth doing.  you cannot tell alexa to skip over the table of contents, or goto page 1 or goto chapter 3.  nothing like that.  you cannot tell her to skip a page, or re-read anything.  and the biggest problem, she reads far too fast.  and telling her to ""read slower"" appears to do something, but; really - she reads at a breakneck pace, and; there is not way to make her read slower.i will report again when i have had time to try the other things it clams to do.  but so far, i like the echo, and; the alexa app is seamless with it.  if amazon can make it read my kindle books - and not keep telling me to get an audible account, that would be a greatly appreciated thing to improve!2017-nov-19 - additional follow-up:okay, in general, this device works well.  some thoughts about how it can be improved.  when talking to the device, it would be good if alexa responded to polite interactions.  if i say, ""alexa, thank you"", she should reply with ""you are welcome!""  or even ""you are welcome roger.""  another improvement, would be, to allow volume to be software driven.  today, i must walk across the room to make it louder or softer.  by pushing the volume buttons.  but, that is rather counter-intuitive.  since it does ""everything else"" by voice....  it makes sense that it would also allow me to say, ""alexa, volume up please.""  ""alexa.  volume down please"".  and, ""alexa, mute please""  ""alexa, un-mute please"".  with positive reply from alexa, like:  ""your device will be muted until you un-mute or restart it"".  and, ""your device is now un_muted roger.""it could, and perhaps should, also have a few more apps available.  i cannot say, for sure, what they might be.  but, interaction between alexa and the user is the key.  for instance, since it has timer(s) and reminder(s), it would be good to be able to have it, perform actions every day at given times--recurring reminders. the obvious reminders like:  ""roger, it is noon - time for lunch.""  or ""roger, it is 7pm, time to call your mother.""  stuff like that - that repeat - daily.i still think alexa should be able to read my kindle books, with a slower pace.  and, be told to skip pages, or even chapters.""  right now, it annoyingly reads every single thing, including table of contents, etc.  and, it does not remember where it left off.  this would be useful.  to have alexa read a kindle, and; like me, place a bookmark, and resume reading by saying, ""roger, we last left off in chapter ###, page ###.""  being even smarter, would be to backup a paragraph, or so, when resuming.  but, that would be far beyond what i am sure these young developers are capable of doing.in summary:  the echo is a solid device.  it is sound quality is outstanding!  and, it does a very nice job of playing my amazon music.  it should have some improvements like:  (a) allow (also) laptop - not merely phone - to interface with the device; (b) allow (also) for software volume up/down/mute/un_mute; (c) have repeated reminders; (d) have pace variable speed reading of kindle books; (e) have more built-in applications - and perhaps more new(s) source options.i hope to see some of these improvements in 2018.;o)"
1565,0,"i love having it around.  it is useful and fun to play with.  i have a slow learning curve in finding out how to make it understand something -- moy voice is clear; my phaseology often is not what alexa would like, so it takes a period of experimentation.  i would like a small pamphlet or something to help me."
1566,14,"not only does my new echo answer my questions, update me on the news, play my music, run my roomba, but it cooks me dinner and washes my dishes. i think ill marry it."
1567,13,https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b06xcm9lj4/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=utf8&tag=vanessaomarie-20&creative=9325&linkcode=as2&creativeasin=b06xcm9lj4&linkid=6ff3c31535df57c21546195c3d36af85  i love my alexa.  however i bought one for my father and his is so different from mine.  definitely worth the price.
1568,9,"i love this thing! i have it in my bedroom and it does everything from telling me the weather to telling me jokes, from recipes to calling my family and so so much more. also the speakers are amazing for music. for this to be so small it can fill my entire room with music or ambient sound, whatever i need!"
1569,14,"i have two echoes (1st and 2nd generation) and a dot. i mostly love them but they haveh bugs that drive me crazy. for days at a time they will stop playing a playlist after one song...then work fine for weeks. some days the echo does not understand the concept of ""shuffle my playlist xyz"" and will just respond ""playing your playlist xyz"" and proceed to play the songs in order. after it has started, though, the echo does understand ""shuffle mode"". after some time it will again be able to shuffle a playlist when asked.same thing with the alexa app which has been unable to show me any information on the playing and queue pages for two weeks now, but then was fine for a couple of hours."
1570,11,"i am not sure the sound is as good as the original, but it sure seems to do a better job of hearing me when using the wake word, even in noising environments and with music playing."
1571,9,"we were a little leary at first purchasing the echo, but we are so glad we did. the possibilities are endless! my husband loves the device. we play out music, lookbup recipes and other things."
1572,14,"i love the echo.  i got it mainly as i have a degenerative illness and i can order, call, get answers whenever i need to.  the only thing i do not like is the echo occasionally loses its connection with the add on to enable calls to be made. when the connection is reestablished alexa announces it in a loud voice."
1573,14,"while a lot of people are chatting up sonos, i love my add-on echo 2 because it connects with the other echo devices i already own to play synchronized music throughout the home. why replace what i already have when i can build on it at my own pace at a much lower cost and still get great sound?"
1574,14,"revised review....... as of right now this product is satisfactory.  the music finally sounds pretty good? the bass is deeper than it first was. not really sure if the music sounds as good coming out of this as it does on the 1st generation echo? it is certainly louder. i have decided to go ahead and keep mine. i did not enjoy giving this a bad review. but i had no other choice because it was not up to par the first few days i had it. i wish amazon would have made sure the device was top of the line before they shipped the first orders....i am still leaving my negative review up because, at the time all negative  comments were made...that is exactly what i was experiencing the first few days i  was testing this product out.i purchased this new echo with the promise that the sound was better than the original echo. improved sound? well guess what, the sound is no better, it is much worse. i put them side-by-side and the original echo  is better by leaps and bounds! i was excited to get this because amazon marketed this as  ""all-new echo (2nd generation) with improved sound"" ? should not these devices be tested before they put them on the market? i guess,  ""us"" the public should have thought it over before ordering? a cheaper price usually means an inferior product. mine is going back just like the new generation fire tv did!! i have been an amazon customer since 1998, and have been satisfied most of the time? however, with this product, they could have done better. i would have been happy to pay more money for actual better sound. there should not have to be an update to make it sound better? amazon created both the 1st and this 2nd generation echo. anyone with any intelligence would know that this is an inferior product when compared to the 1st gen. echo. it is like they did not even test this or try with it. instead theymarket it as improved sound, now with dolby. anyone that bought this was duped big-time. i am going to keep mine a few more days to see if they can make it is sound improved as they first said it was! if there is not a significant improvement mine goes back. i am glad i still have my  original echo.like i already mentioned. they market this as better sound? after the complaints roll in they say a firmware fix should help? help? why would a band new tested product be defective to begin with??? they cheapened the product, and they know it! it is not better!!!! if it were better it would defiantly have a higher price!!!! i would have been happy to pay a higher price for actual better sound? we the customers deserve some compensation for the damn stress and trouble this lame product has caused us!!!update....a very nice lady from amazon called me to ask a few questions. i basically told her what my review had already explained. during the conversation i found out this lady had not even had  a chance to listen to the new echo herself? i thought that was strange to saythe least? it is like amazon did not even bother to test this product before putting it on the market? i was told on the phone i had 29 days  to send it back. i am going to hold off on sending it back for a few days in the hopes something can be  done to  tweak it up to make it sound like it was advertised sound? so far mine still sounds the same? badupdate....mine still sounds the same....not good!!!!! bad!!! horrible sound. on another note, has anyone else noticed how some reviewers are trolling our reviews, making comments that there has been a fix for this product? do these people work for amazon? i am beginning to think they do? when something is not working as advertised the manufacturer needs to step up to the plate and  do something? this company is huge and they know exactly what is going on here!!!!!!update..wow!  the reviews for this are improving by leaps and bounds...i gotta tell'ya!  unfortunately, the sound has not improved by leaps and bounds! it is still the same, lame!!!!"
1575,14,"every bit as good as i thought it would be.  the only problem is i can not turn utilities on and off because of my router puts out 2 frequencies, and the electric switches only comes in the 2.5 range, and i use the alexa in the 5 gig frequentcy.  changed its wake up word to ¡°computer¡± to hono star trek."
1576,11,"alexa now has a deeper, fuller voice! the bigger speaker (compared to the dot) makes a huge difference. also, the mics seem to work better, even though they are supposed to be the same(?). music however, is what it is all about. this little gadget fills the room with rich, full sound. love it."
1577,14,"makes listening to music so easy and starts my day with top news, weather report & my calendar.  wish my soundlink mini bose speaker would ""pair"" with it....says it should but the bluetooth will not connect.  maybe my 4 year old soundlink mini bluetooth is earlier ""generation""???"
1578,11,"quality unit, alexa functions worked as well as dot.  sound quality, especially trying to get a solid bass sound is severely lacking.  there needs to be a step up to net similar benefits available with quality bluetooth speakers.  the grey/silver fabric cover was also not very attractive.  it did not complement the ss appliances in the kitchen."
1579,11,overall it is an improvement over the dot. the speaker is definitely better but i find myself having to yell at it from a distance to activate it. the mics in it seem to be less sensitive than the dot. if you¡¯re hooked up to a stero or high quality speaker for music do not know if it is worth the extra money. definitely looks better than the dot though.
1580,14,i bought this alexa as a black friday special and i really love it. i also purchased three smart plugs and a light switch to get started. set up was easy and fast.  i went back and purchased two dots as well so i could use alexa in different areas of the house.  i also have the amazon fire stick but have not been able to figure out how to combine the two.  i have no issues with the sound quality and did not bother to hook up my bose speaker to the device.  still have no regrets after using it for over a month.
1581,14,i absolutely love my echo. it is now my fav electronic. i use it everyday. her answers to silly questions amaze me. i love the fact that she does exactly what i say like play this or skip that or what is the weather in this state. very high tech and doing quality is better than the beats brand (just my personal opinion)
1582,14,i love the echo i have several but i hate it that packages when delivered say i handed it to the customer of the house ...to many deliverers do that! covers themselves !
1583,14,"i bought one as a gift for one of my children, while setting it up..which was easy, i liked it so much i bought one for myself. now i will be purchasing another for my kitchen so i do not have to move it twice a day!  i took it on vacation and it was easy to connect to the internet and then reconnect when i went home. it has great sound for music, and is handy when i want current weather or news. i know it does alot more than i use it for and look forward to discovering other features."
1584,14,"i put off getting one of these and over christmas finally broke down and got a full size and a dot, and use both of them everyday.  if you are an amazon prime member you need to just go ahead and get one.  they are very handy.  i bought some wifi electric sockets that just plug into your outlet and use it to cut lights off and on and stream music or just ask questions."
1585,14,"right now i am giving it four stars only because i have had less it than a week. the sound quality is great and the setup was very easy. i have only used it for a couple of things so far, linked my sirius/xm account to it and also my pandora account. i noticed that it picks up my voice even when i am in another room so i have to be careful when i say alexa when i am trying to explain to my wife how everything works."
1586,10,"help!  alexa is taking over our life.... but we have not used it to order from amazon. we use iheart radio, shopping list, weather, alarms and timers... just so easy to speak to it and make it happen.just connected the nest thermostat...my wife was not thrilled when i bought it.. but she loves it to...entertainment value is an 8 - ask for music to poop by..."
1587,14,"for spoken words, the sound is ""too rich"" -- too much bass and reverb -- but for music, it is great.  i have a first-generation echo in a different part of the house, and the ""drop-in"" feature is handy at times.  really wish i could set timers and reminders for one on the other!!!"
1588,14,"this second generation has improved slightly over the first one.  seems like the sound has improved some.  we give it 5 stars as we think overall the echos are a great tool/toy for the family to use.  it takes a while to learn what it can do, but once you figure more stuff out, i think you will be impressed."
1589,14,"i am in australia and bought the echo from the usa.  i am sure it is very good, but i can not use/try it -  amazon has not set up for echo and alexa to be used in australia.  amazon says ""early in 2018""  ... but i cannot find out when that will be.  if apple is homepod is available for purchase soon, i will buy that ... and be able to use it straight away.i realise that i can try to trick alexa into thinking i am in the usa - but why should i have to go through that.dp"
1590,14,"i primarily use it for music, the sound is very good and you can feel some bass.  there are a ton of things you can do with it but i keep it basic.  the function to make phone calls through the echo is a nice feature.  i can not speak for it is durability at this time,  if i have any i will update my review."
1591,10,"thanks to amazon for inventing this womderful.item! i love, love, love it.  i am constantly forgetting to add grocery items to shopping lists on my phone.  or forgetting the written list at home.  i can talk to her from the kitchen and she will add it to my list.  she is a must have for any household."
1592,14,"does what i wanted.  however, looking at next weeks black friday advertisements, i kinda feel bad because it will be $20cheaper next week, i should have waited and you should too"
1593,14,at first i liked the unity until i played music on it. terrible and i was sold on improvement. not so. switched back to my echo 1st generation and returned it. very disappointed.
1594,11,"the microphone is not as sensitive, the sound isnt as good.  i miss the ring you can turn with your hands for volume.  it is nice that its shorter, but i wish i had shelled out for the ¡°echo plus¡±.  my original echo keeps its spot of honor in the kitchen. this new one got relegated to the kids room"
1595,9,"got this for my son he loves it! it is neat he does not even have to look up weather ""alexa"" does it all! ita neat!sound is pretty good!"
1596,10,"loving the amazon echo. great product. amazon echo comes in handy around the house with music, news, weather and other info. its great having all the info within voice reach."
1597,11,echo 2nd gen works great!  alexa voice responses and very fast and clear. echo is speaker is good as a stand alone but i really like the option having my sonos speakers paired with my echo.
1598,14,"we own the first-gen version and while this new one looks nicer, i was expecting better performance. problems include random ""i did not quite get that"" when we were not asking it anything, and very poor ""grouping"" features to make it and the old one play music simultaneously."
1599,14,"love it. the sound is good for listening to music.  while it does not sound audio wise as great as google home, it still sounds good and alexa is the best.  i use it in my dorm room for a variety of functions and could not be happuer.  due to delivery screw up and black friday sale i paid way less than the regular price."
1600,14,keeps dropping wi-fi. useless!!!!!!
1601,14,"make me laugh a lot,,,,and the quality of the sound is very good,,,,,considering the dimensions and features is a good product...i try siri, cortana, etc, and they do not understand because my foreign accent but  this one understand me almost 100 % of the time ...i am happy with the performance."
1602,10,i was skeptical about getting one just because i¡¯ve never used one. i got it for my mother for christmas and during family dinner it was so fun and easy to ask for certain songs or answers to questions. this product is definitely a huge help when your hands are full or you just want to hear your favorite song.
1603,10,i¡¯m thrilled with echo. the sound is very good.  i listen to music all the time. we ask sports questions etc.  it is really great.  best birthday present ever.
1604,10,"really enjoying the echo.  get accurate weather reports upon request.  no longer waiting for weather channel updates.  also, enjoy the music choices from country to pop.  can hear an entire album or the top choices in a music genre.  jokes are corny--perfect for a 7-year-old granddaughter to take to school.  love using the any-do app for grocery shopping."
1605,9,"my dad just turned 74 and we got this for his birthday.  he is absolutely in love.  he loves that he can get radio stations from all over the country and listen to the people he likes to listen to.  he said the sound on it is very clear.  so when it comes to giving birthday presents, i guess you could say we nailed it."
1606,9,"the sound quality of the tap is amazing! we love that it an operate on it is own, or it can play whatever the echo dot is playing. my husband is a big music buff so he often takes it around the house to wherever he is so he can stream music. we love it so much we bought as christmas presents for our friends!"
1607,0,"awesome gadget that everyone will love.  it has descent speaker.  you can ask alexa anything & she will answer you.  find out the weather, play music.  it can connect to my fire tv.  of course it has it is limitations.  if she does not know what you are asking her, she will say, ""sorry, i do not know that..""  it is like having a personal assistant at home."
1608,10,"daughters boyfriend loves it!! bought for him so that he can play at home with his and stop leaving annoying alarms on mine ""about how awesome he is"" and that "" i need to remember to pick up beer for damon when i go to the store "" let is just say he and i are very happy with this purchase!!!"
1609,9,"we love it!!! my husband listens to it everyday while getting ready and every time our little one is in the tub or getting ready for bed. it can tell you the weather and the genre of a song you like so you can listen others like it... definitely a great bye, and possibly future purchase again <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+008a>"
1610,14,"**revision on 2017.11.18 - my 3 echo2s are now running firmware ending in 2720, which is the 2nd post-purchase revision. i am upping my review from 1 star to 3 stars, due to improvements in the sound resulting from the latest revision.i may have a slight confirmation bias to the original echos (i have 2), so i am factoring that in when i say i have a very slight preference for them over the echo2s. but it is close enough that it is no longer an issue for me as to music sound quality. i am calling the original issue fixed. why no more stars then? couple of reasons: i sorely miss the rotating rheostat volume control on the original echos. i know; you can still have that on the new echo plus. i also, now that i have them, prefer the hard metallic finish to the fabric finish. thinking long-term durability and dust-gathering. i do love the ""silver"" finish on the echo plus (i have 1.) it is thankfully not bright silver, much more muted than i was expecting, which is a good thing. but those are subjective, and do not count for the large part of my reason for going to only 3 stars. the real reason is something that can probably be fixed by amazon at some point, and probably will be. but for now: the new streaming music group capability is why i ordered the additional devices; whole-house music. it is wonderful...when it works properly. but the sw is still a bit glitchy. often, one device in the everywhere group will just suddenly go silent, stop streaming, even though it is still on the network, and responsive to queries, so it is not a local network issue. to get the streaming back, i have to stop streaming, reboot the device, then start streaming again. i do not wqant to be a tech...i just want to listen to music everywhere with some reliability. i do have a lot of devices (2 original echos, 3 dots, 1 show, 1 echo plus and 3 echo2s) for a total of ten devices in my everywhere group. but...i have plenty of bandwidth, both wan (230mbps) and lan (2 5ghz channels and 1 2.7ghz channels), with strong to very strong signal everywhere in the house. i have found that they work better and more consistently on one of the 5gb bands, and when they are all on the same band and channel. still, in addition to one of the devices (not the same one always) dropping out of the music stream but remaining online, there is another problem: occasionally, one device (random) will drop off the network entirely, and appear offline, requiring at least a reboot. sometimes, i have to delete the everywhere group and reconstitute it to get all 10 devices back online and working together for music streaming. this is a pita, and as i said, i just want them to work. i do not want to be a tech everyday. third glitch: i start streaming to everywhere from one device, say the bathroom original echo. then i want to change the program material from a different device, say the show in the kitchen. this can result in the seond device to become entirely locked, requiring a reboot, or it can result in a comical back-and-forth with alexa reporting :""another device is already streaming."" or ""i am sorry, i do not know that."" huh? all i said was ""alexa, play enigma everywhere."" sometimes all streaming stops. sometimes it continues playing the originally requested music. sometimes it works! sometimes it goes completely mute. so, long story long, until the sw is smoothed out and the devices stay connected reliably without my tinkering, i go from my original 1 star to just 3 stars. but i would love to revise this to 5 stars, just like i would love to listen to music everywhere reliably, and have all devices remaining connect to my lan. i will keep you posted!**revision: waiting on sw update. i understand an update is available to fix the poor sound performance, so i am awaiting that and will revise again if/when i receive it. devices have to be dormant to receive updates, so all have been muted. if no update by tomorrow, i will return my 3-pack. if the update is received, i will post results as another revision.original review follows: so disappointed! ""improved sound"", we are told. ""features dolby"", we are told. what we are not told is that these new shorties are thin and weak for music. i bought additional echo devices so i could have one in each room when amazon announced synced music streaming to multiple devices. i bought 3-pack of gen2 and 1 new echo plus (with hub). i have 2 gen1 echos, 3 dots, and 1 show. initial comparisons: gen1 and echo plus are very close, but i still prefer sound of gen1. gen2 echos (shorties) are inferior to both gen1 and plus. the show sounds fine if you are right in front of it, but awful from sides & rear. dots, of course, do not compare at all, but useful for other than music. make sure all devices are at least 8 inches from any wall as recommended. that helps. this is only after a few hours comparison, but both wife and i agree on quality of music sound as compared above. no more gen2s for me. they lack the fullness, resonance and roundness of the gen1s sound. for music, the gen1 (tall) echos are superb; but the joke is on us...you can not buy them any longer. the bottom line is that these gen2 echos are in no way an improvement over the gen1 echos; they are inferior in every respect."
1611,14,much better speaker than the dot i have.  same alexa experience and that is a good thing.  i do not like that it has a proprietary power cable.
1612,10,"i received the new echo for christmas, and it is wonderful. our family uses it to search for questions to homework, play music, and add items to our amazon shopping cart. the sound from this device is phenomenal, and now the echo serves as the main speaker in our home. i link my phone via blu-tooth and play songs, and it surpasses the quality i expected. i recommend this to anyone."
1613,10,love this and alexa!  the sound is great and since i have amazon prime a lot of music is available to me.  alexa play... and i am listening to a song i like or a playlist.  it is so easy.
1614,0,"great sound with the music...however, either i am not asking alexa properly or she is having trouble understanding my requests. do i need to request a song title by a specific artist or the other way around? periodically i get a ""sorry, i do not know that one"" i am trying to be slower and more careful when i ask a question. it could be me. otherwise, great help in the kitchen! your almost there--hot tea would be nice :)"
1615,11,ok so i love alexa and how great her voice recognition is with background noise and distance.i had the 1st gen echo along with dots but the echo was loud and did the job.now that i have the new 2nd gen echo i¡¯m mind blown how amazing the sound quality is! it actually has rich deep tones which the 1st did not. i¡¯m sure sonos has great speakers but dang this echo had me keep saying wow!!
1616,14,very pleased with this purchase!  sound is good for me as a person who loves listening to music but does not care too much about the quality of sound as long as it is not bad- and the sound is not bad!
1617,0,"great for adults and children; she answers everything that you¡¯d want your teens or smaller children to know, how to spell, math problems, reads bible verses etc..sports reviews, game stats, gamer questions, anything that can be found on internet that is appropriate, she refuses to be inappropriate.she plays any song you want and sounds awesome.she gives news anywhere, weather anywhere.excellent purchase."
1618,14,"was not going to get one at first, but my parents bought the dot when it was on sale. love the quality of the larger one, sounds better and is louder. still does the same things. only downfall is that we have to spend more money to buy the wifi lights, locks and outlets. which my fiance is begging to have."
1619,14,"i bought this for my parents who prefer flip phones over smart phones.  now instead of calling me with general info questions, they can ask alexa.  i took off a star because it is not as intuitive as google.  for some answers, my parents have to think about how to ask the questions in order to get the answer.  where as google is more adapt at just knowing what you are asking.  excellent sound quality and my mom loves the amazon music integration."
1620,14,"just as amazing as the hub, the sound quality is exceptional. i think this is worth every dollar spent. i have not had a single problem with alexa, understands everything."
1621,14,"been using alexa on echo dots for some time and really like it. so i ordered 3 of these to replace my echo dots.first off, i found that the sound quality was not as good as the 1st generation echo. but worst, had issues with the new echo repeatedly loosing the network. after fighting with them for some time, i put one of my echo dots back in service. the echo dot had no issues, but the echos still kept loosing the network. i returned the 3 2nd generation echos and put my echo dots back in service."
1622,0,"it is excellent! speaks clear, you can understand what it saying even though it is shockingly small but big sound. does not know the answers to some questions that is asked but eventually at a later time it might. i noticed it is learning more, the more i play with it. it also funny some things it says and i tell it so. also will tell story is and read you books, also the music is great. awesome."
1623,14,"my second echo replacing an amazon tap that continually had connectivity issues. setup took just a few seconds, connectivity is consistent and sound is excellent for the size. i like that i was able to connect the 2 echos. voice recognition is excellent and alexa response is quick and accurate."
1624,11,was not certain i wanted to get an echo but i absolutely love it & look forward to added more smart devices. the sound on this is great and easy fills a room with quality sound.
1625,14,"initially i was shopping for bluetooth speaker but decided to try the amazon echo instead of a bluetooth speaker. i¡¯m really glad i made this purchase, the amount of things you could do with this device makes it so much fun and interesting. i¡¯ve enjoyed it so much that i shared my experience with friends and family and they have madr purchases for their homes.  what i really enjoy the most is telling alexa to start my day and she¡¯ll tell me the temperature outside, the traffic report to work, the news flash and just before i head out i¡¯ll ask her to start my car then i¡¯m off to start my day. we¡¯ve also enjoyed family time playing games like trivia and song quiz. i¡¯m so glad i made this choice rather than getting a bluetooth speaker."
1626,14,the app you have to use to operate alexa is the slowest i think i have ever seen in my entire life.  which renders it useless because it can not be set up. once you get it set up it only works for a little bit if you unplug it and plug it back in you go through all the steps again. now it will not even answer anything i say or do anything it supposed to do.
1627,14,"the echo works very well as a bluetooth speaker. additionally, with 2 managed power outlets connected, i can now control the lights in 2 rooms by voice command.  this is handy in the morning after programming a morning routine which turns on lights, tells me the weather and traffic conditions from home to work."
1628,10,"love, love my alexa. i treated myself to this to see if i would like it. i can set a timer, find out the weather, listen to music, play games? terrific product!"
1629,9,have been using the new 2 nd generation echo for three weeks and find it just as pleasant to use as the first generation echo with a richer more bassy sound. my wife and i are very happy to have this as our second echo.
1630,14,"easier connection to my network, i like the smaller design and did not lose sound quality.  great in the kitchen for playing music, using alexa as a timer for cooking, asking inane trivia questions, and much more.  now i need to figure out what happened to my generation 1 echo...(it will not connect to my wi-fi network)"
1631,14,"it takes some time to get used to alexa.  i have a friend named alexis.  alexa starts to respond to alexs... (the indicator ring comes on, but when i finish with ...is, alexa gets mad and shuts down.  seriously,  i installed four light bulbs.  alexa easily controls them.  next to be added to the system is a light switch for my den.  ""alexa, turn on den light."""
1632,14,"is there anything not to love about this speaker? after many deep conversations with myself i decided to give this device a try and preordered as soon as it was advertised. from giving me step by step instructions for a nutella brownie recipe, to being able to conveniently play my favorite tunes as soon as i walk into my house from work... priceless! alexa is response is very accurate, even with music playing loud. sound quality is not the ultimate best but it is very very very good."
1633,0,does not seem to work all the time have to repeat myself a lot to get it to respond but really enjoyed the music plays and it has trouble answering a lot of questions .
1634,10,we love alexa. it is so cool to get a news flash brief in the morning and ask for dinner music at night. the sound is great. and she¡¯ll play the radio too. and serves as an intercom
1635,14,my echo has been working perfectly. i had it connect to my lifx lights with no problem and i have it set to play calming music for my dog when i am not there.
1636,14,"oh my goodness!  it is only been two hours and i am already in love!!!  i had considered just getting another bluetooth speaker so i did not have to tote the one i have all over the place.  after finding that the echo was only about $20 more, i took the leap!  it is amazing! the sound quality is better than my speaker and it is so nice being able to simply say what i want and getting it.  alexa, where have you been all my life!!!"
1637,9,i have had an echo since nov 2016 and love it so much that i bought this one for each of my daughters and mother for christmas. sound is somewhat richer than a dot.
1638,14,"great sound .wonderful,music available.  extremely  useful for individuals with greatly impaired vision. makes available information that cannot be viewed because on poor vision. i found it difficult to set up and program for the average person who has no special tech knowledge, some  features available and calling the help desk was very frustrating. most employees did not know how to help, would leave you waiting for long periods of time while they found  an answer , which often did not solve the problem , and were difficult to understand"
1639,14,the echo works fine butt there is a great deal of information that is not well understood or known.  it was disappointing in that sense but overall we are happy with the purchase and have utilized it.
1640,14,"really fun to use good sounding speaker, use it for spotify a lot.  misunderstands or does not quite understand you quite a bit. if you are looking for something that can answer questions or  quickly get you information i recommend getting a google home instead.  if your home is already set up for an echo or you are a huge amazon customer i highly recommend  this. if you are just now starting out your smart home and are not amazon committed i suggest starting with a google home."
1641,10,"love it. gives me daily news, plays music, reads a book to me when i am crocheting, keeps my lists, easy to use.super easy set up, looks great, works great. really enjoy it."
1642,14,i had a few dots before this then decided to go for an echo since it was on sale and now i dont want anything less than this.  the sound quality is outstanding and it looks great anywhere in the house. i was blown away by the quality when i took it out of the box.  i need more of these now :/
1643,10,"convenient and fun to use.  among other things,  i have alexa play all kinds of music from classical to rap.  whether new or old and obscure,  she always has the artist i request  she gives me the weather, reminds me of my pill schedule and appointments, defines words, etc.  she is really amazing."
1644,14,"i love amazon echo and have them all around the house. i love convenience features like lists, reminders, timers, etc.my wishes are for1. better volume control. it needs better resolution. 3 is too soft, 4 is too loud.2. groups are weak. one echo should be able to belong to multiple groups. i am surprised that all is not a group.3. reminders timers and alarms should be able to alert groups of echos for when i am working around the house in multiple rooms.i love echo but there are improvements to be made."
1645,10,"there is nothing not to like about the echo. i  use it every day for a huge variety of reason. from an oven timer, to answers to questions i have to playing my favorite songs. the speakers are amazing for playing music. ask questions, play games, read stories, meditate etc. etc. the echo can help you do it."
1646,14,"i have two dots and a tap; i like this one very much because it hears me better that my tap (i like the tap because it is chargeable and i can take it to work, which is really nice).  i can use a normal speaking voice and most of the time it responds, speakers are good.  i do like how it looks (got the grey one)."
1647,0,"i would probably give it 5 stars; however, i have only had time to get to know it for limited application.  after a few months, i will try to update.  i have used it to get classical music, time, weather and information re various questions posed,  that is it at this point.  it was a christmas gift from my son and i like it very much."
1648,9,"i love my new echo . my son bought it for me for christmas . i was so pleasantly surprised . the sound is unbelievable , and so crystal clear . i have it in my dining room . i listen to it while i am on my laptop . i am going to buy another one for my bedroom . living on a fixed income , it may take me a bit , but i will get another one . honestly , i can not think of anything i dislike about it . alexa and i have become best friends . thank you amazon for the wonderful piece of equipment my son purchased from you , for me for christmas . again , love love love it ."
1649,10,"very nice product. alexa can here your voice even when the music on or across the room. sound quality is amazing for a $99 speaker. highly recommend this product if you like listening to music and you have spotify,pandora or amazon music. i use spotify and all i have to say is ¡°alexa, play my music¡± and she will play music from my spotify playlist. she also tells some pretty funny jokes and is awesome with reminders."
1650,14,i received this as a christmas gift.  thought it was just another overrated electronic device.  but i have been totally surprised with its abilities.  relatively easy to set up.  very user friendly and actually a pleasure to use.  probably need to get another one for other rooms in house.
1651,14,"another unbelievable product from amazon. the new echo is sleek, compact and rocks in sound !!!!! thank you. keep up the great innovative works amazon!! you guys rock !!!!!"
1652,0,"first of all, i would  like to know how amazon knew that i purchased this product when i went into best buy and purchased it in the store.  second, alexa has turned on for no apparent reason, even if the house is quiet, and says something like ¡°i do not understand your request¡± or ¡°i¡¯ve never heard of that¡±. makes me think someone else is listening and giving alexa commands.but alexa is a great little product in that the speaker sounds great and it answers most any question i have. better than siri.  it makes it very convenient for me to turn on music or get a recipe without having to stop what i¡¯m doing."
1653,0,"i do not know if mine is defective or what. i have to keep repeating myself because it does not seem to hear me. also when music is playing and you say alexa, it is supposed to mute the sound but it does not always do that. very annoying and i feel like i wasted 100 bucks."
1654,9,"purchased this for my wife for christmas. thought it would keep her company when i was out working and kids were in school.  she loves it.  she listens to her favorite music, checks the weather, asks questions to help kids with homework, and many other things.  was a great gift for her."
1655,14,the echo is great. i received it as a gift and when i sigo into alexa it brought the account for the person who gave it to me as a gift. this is a problem. ever since i was forced to then change the password i have not been able to log into any of my amazon accounts. i called amazon and was on the phone on and off for 2 hours and nothing was resolved.
1656,14,"i am basing my review off previously purchasing an echo dot. the sound of the echo is far better, with a good balance of bass and treble. the dolby sound does have a surround effect and sounds like it could be coming from anywhere in the room. i would recommend if you are looking for an accessory to your amazon prime account."
1657,14,"i got these so that my disabled wife could ask for assistance.  so far, it is working exceptionally well.we have multiple units in the home and she can ""call"" to a unit where i am working.  also, now adding home automation where she can turn on a device to get my attention.nice."
1658,10,i enjoy using the echo for listening to my audiobooks.  i use her for the weather and to tell me jokes.  a lot of times i will ask her a question and she does not know so then i have to use siri on my iphone. i am learning more things she can do.  i would definitely recommend this product and i will be purchasing a second one for my bedroom in the near future
1659,14,"the sound is so-so when playing music. otherwise, the echo is used in our home, more or less, as a toy. it is handy for a weather report, but that is about it for ""practical"" functions for us. it has trouble connecting to the fire stick and has successfully only once in multiple attempts. i think it worked after a fire stick ""reset, but  only that one time."
1660,14,"i was an early adopter of the echo and one of the initial impressions was that the sound was muddy sounding. this goes a long way toward solving that with much better bass and cleaner highs. on the functionality side the skills are numerous, in fact it is a major problem keeping up with them. many times they just do not get accessed."
1661,11,i honestly cannot tell the difference in sound from the original echo and this one. both are excellent. maybe not sonos quality sound but i really think they do the job.
1662,14,this thing is nothing more than a toy that can control systems in your house. yes it is very convenient and the things alexa will say and inform you on is neat. we like it and this is by far the absolute loudest alarm clock ever. we love that. plus if you say bad things to alexa she will be a smart ass back to you.
1663,10,this echo has much louder speakers than the last echo. it is shorter and fatter than the last generation. i really like it it seems like it picks up my commands easier. i use my echo for everything from shopping list to playing music while i am cleaning to setting timers and waking me up in the morning :-) oh and also it finds my phone many times during the day lol i do not know what i would do without my echo!
1664,14,i am shocked at how good this speaker sounds.  deep crisp bass.  i will be learning all the things it can do over time.  the intercoms is a wonderful feature.
1665,14,sound is definite improvement over echo dot and very good for general music play. i was a little disappointed with the microphone function vs. the dot as i did not see any real relative improvement. if you already have decent bluetooth speakers to pair it with you are better off just getting the dot and save the additional cost.
1666,10,love everything about echo 2.  sound is fabulous!  the interaction with alexa and amount of things that can be done is wonderful- loved being ableto play all my favorite singers and songs.  all genres of music including dance.  really enjoyed new years eve with alexa entertainment.this devicehas replaced my entire music cabinet
1667,10,"i own an echo and i loved it so much that i purchased one for my parents.  my girls and i use to to keep up with our grocery list, play music, play games, get the weather forecast, place amazon orders and much more. it is a great product that i would recommend to all families."
1668,14,"love my echo! i bought the dot first, but found the sound quality to be unbearable. i considered pairing the dot with a bluetooth speaker, but i decided to give the echo a try. i am so glad i did! i can not wait to learn more about what alexa can do. so far, i use it for music, my alarm, random questions, and listen to news briefings. sound quality is top notch!"
1669,10,it is great.  alexa answers almost all the questions asked.  my wife loves it for playing her music.  it was a great gift from our son and we enjoy it.
1670,14,"the sound quality is very good and the reception of the sound is excellent unlike that of many radios. the installation is more difficult than that of the echo unit that i bought a few years ago but i was able to do it with help from my son (he is an adult). i am very pleased with it. i have not had any problems in using it. i do not use it to control home devices, e.g., garage door opener, because i do not have smart controls in my home.i recommend this device very highly because the audio fidelity and fullness of the music that i listen to while i exercise on the stationary exercise bike in my basement. i recommend this device very  highly."
1671,9,i bought this 2nd gen echo for my brother for christmas and he loves it! i have the 1st gen and enjoy having it so i gave him one as a gift. he plays around with it all the time and is constantly telling me things about the devices that i did not even know. he says it is a great gift!
1672,10,i can not say enough about this little round black pringle s can. lol. i love it. music oncpmmand. any kind.news on command. any kind. meditation relaxation games it is wonderful. thank you so much for coming up with such a great product highly recommend very easy to set up love love love love it
1673,14,"i like all the different music venues alexa allows for. e.g. individual songs, albums, artists, genre, etc. the speaker has a very good sound for such a small package. at times i ask for certain sport results without a result. e.g. what was the psu mens basket ball score last night. is very handy for reminders and to set timers."
1674,0,had trouble at first - when it was set up it worked and then later it would only talk with me after 5pm. turned out to be plugged into a half hot outlet. since we moved it - alexa answers me all the time - i love the ability to play music when ever i want.i am most happy with it.
1675,14,"this device is for bass lovers and book listeners.  it puts the bass up to the top and makes vocals sound clearer. so basically trance,  disco,  edm,  and metal sound great. but hip hop like outkast b.o.b. sounds off because it is instrumnational. i love the bass on this thing, for it is most baller in indeed."
1676,14,"love it.  requesting music is wonderful.  i made the mistake of entering two phones and voices rather than creating a household.  by entering two voices and cell phones my grocery list ended up on the other phone.  i removed that phone and created a household, and i now have ""my"" grocery list.the grocery list and to do list are great.  i now go to the store with my phone and can delete items as i place them in the cart.i now have an echo dot to set up.  not sure how the two will coordinate, but hopefully i or ""they"" will figure it out."
1677,14,great sound as a speaker and the alexa function has really grown on our family!  i now go d myself purchasing all sorts of smart devices to automate my house!  love the ability to link to numerous music services and use the list and timer constantly.  well worth the money. actually bought 2 dots to put in inter rooms too.
1678,14,"i love this device. that does not mean that it is perfect, but it is a great device. the sound is great, being able to use my spotify account on it is awesome. you can even (if you have multiple devices) play music across all the devices. the only issue is that you have to use amazon music if you want to use the multi room function. i use spotify so that function is a no go. a lot of different games and smart house functions that make it useful and fun. plus if you ask it ""what is my purpose?"" it will tell you that your purpose is to serve butter."
1679,11,"nice look and feel! i have both the original and the 2nd generation! they sound really good together! i kind of prefer the twist for volume on the old vs push button on the new, but that is only if you do not feel like telling it what to do! lol overall very pleased! definitely a step up in style!"
1680,10,honestly not as responsive as the dot. but still amazing. love the daily from the ny times and my daily briefing. its fun to know too that this is the only briefing our boi kush is able to listen to anymore. fun having something in common with someone 700 million in dbt. love it!!
1681,14,"amazing device!i still have not learned what it can do..have not been able to get it to give commands to nest thermostat, even though the alexa app says it is connected..my internet is only 2-3 mbs and sometimes it does not respond..the shopping list is one of our favorite skills!"
1682,11,"sound is better on this model. lows, mids and highs ...... are clearer, with better separation. like the wood finish. blends nicely with bookshelf. only complaint is volume control. i prefer the dial, as opposed to push-buttons on this model."
1683,10,"oh my gosh. i do not know how i have lived without alexa for so long. the sound quality is great for playing music and there are also lots of ""skills"" (like games, lists, etc) that alexa can do. i am really enjoying it. so much that i bought a second one and an echo dot."
1684,14,"i love this device. i took a star off because the functionality is not complete, there are times when it does not understand my queries and you have to wait for her to tell you she doesnt understand before you can ask again. that being said...with the amazon music app, i rarely have a song she cant find, i love playing jeopardy and many other skills. this is a 5 star device that is in progress. the sound is good and quality is also, eapecially from a small unit"
1685,14,"i use it to remind myself of meetings and errands by saying 'alexa, remind me i have a meeting at 2pm.'  i also subscribed to prime music and ask alexa to, for example, play led zeppelin.'  speaking to program things is easier than typing or pushing buttons.  i like this product."
1686,11,"i never owned the 1st gen, & cannot compare the two of them, but i can at least say, the speaker on this thing is amazing. its not the best, but it sure is better than a $50 speaker you can buy. i do not understand why people say the sound is not the best, unless they must be comparing it too something like beats by dre speakers. other than the amazing sound quality, this is just simply an amazing product. very imprssed."
1687,14,"i was talked into it by friends. as i suspected, it is not ready yet. my son-in-law has a phone with google and he is always showing how his phone is quicker and more accurate. ask the same question and his is invariably better. so many times i get the do not know that response.on the other hand, we really like the ability to play a variety of music with a good speaker with no problems."
1688,14,"i love this, works great. you do have to do a bit of set up on some tasks but i didnt mind as it is very helpful. im still testing out & learning all the things she can do, but so far i am loving it. my alarm company i saw pairs with alexa so that is a super plus to not have to do anything but tell her to turn my thermostat up & down, lock my doors,set my alarm. i love the music feature. its like having all my music right on hand with no storage."
1689,11,"superior to the gen 1 in every way, except with the removal of the turn-able volume knob on the top. i loved that feature. the volume from level 1 to level 2 and 2 to 3 seem huge on this thing and the ability to turn in down in small increments is seriously lacking. the way the gen 1 had the volume adjustment on the top ring of the device was an awesome feature. not sure why they fixed something that was not broken."
1690,10,"i got this as a gift for my wife. she loves it. amazon music, access to loads of information, games, it is great. sound is very good. it is not filling a room with volume, but is provides a pleasant voice and acoustic background when you want it. very happy with purchase. i would recommend."
1691,10,the walnut finish goes great with my counter top where i have it sitting.  it was actually a gift so i am very pleased with it.  there has not been anything yet i have not liked about it but i play music the most. i do use it to set a timer once in awhile and to remind me of appointments
1692,14,"astounded at the fast response time. with amazon music it instantly responds with whatever we request. it recognizes us without adjusting our pronunciation, tone, volume, etc. we can even give it commands from other rooms. we can ask questions in the middle of a discussion and receive quick responses. this was a gift from our son that never would have been considered by either of us, but know we¡¯re considering additional devices. this is amazing technology. and it is fun."
1693,14,"worked well. i am able to voice control my amazon music , or turning on philip smart light bulb or wireless port. setting up the alarm is breezing and task reminders. love the 2nd generation.comparing to my 1st generation, this 2nd seems more compact and lighter with better sound quality."
1694,9,this is the first alexa device we have purchased and it was a huge hit for my dad is christmas present. he immediately bought the light bulbs and thermostat to go with the echo. i cannot speak to the differences between the first and second gen because we have only had this one. but we love it
1695,9,"this is our 3rd alexa echo.sounds great, amazing features.got it for my girlfriends bedroom as she has one for the 1st floor of her house.i have one in my man cave and am thinking of getting another for my upstairs kitchen/living room area.now part of my daily routine."
1696,14,i feel like i am living the life the jetsons showed in their cartoons with alexa in the house.  now if my grandkids would just quit asking her to play the abc song on repeat all day long.  *bonus-the 1 year old knows the alphabet now! lol now if i could just have one of those flying cars i would be set!
1697,0,"i love the amount of apps it integrates with, i wish i could tell siri to play a personal play list on spotify like alexa..  maybe she does, but i have not figured out how to get her to work yet.  i am looking forward to seeing what other cool things i can get it to integrate with"
1698,14,"the differences on these are not clear and therefore i ended up buying the wrong one. unfortunately my wife through the box away and cannot return. this device will not work your lights and thermostat like i was hoping. with that said it is anwounderful device and love the functionality of the echo. the only reason i gave it a 3 star is because of the ambiguity in the  description. had i known i would have gladly spent the extra, at that time, $10.00 and got the echo plus...."
1699,0,"not really sure what to do with it. i occasionally ask it a question and it answers me, but it has not been extremely useful so far. one weird thing, after i got it i received a system update and it stopped responding to ""alexia"", i have to use ""echo"" to get its attention. we do enjoy listening to music with it."
1700,11,this 2nd gen alexa is awesome. the bass in this is a huge improvement. much smaller the the 1st echo by 2 inch is. the fabric looks great definitely a great upgrade and for the price can not beat it
1701,11,"i bought thinking it has a better speaker, but it is the same as the dot. aesthetically is bulky not adding any benefits to the dot.i am resting now the echo plus, and so far much more happy with it."
1702,14,turned out my alexa was not connected to my acct somehow. they saw my comment and called me to help me fixing it right away. that is what i call a great customer service!! (b4) could not connect to smart home device. tried 2 different brands. alexa just could not connect. useless!
1703,9,i bought this for my husband for christmas and we like it!  so far has been working great.  my husband ended up buying the sound bar to go with it and works well!  we are happy to get this and excited for new apps to go along with it.  the ecobee and light app work great with the echo 2nd generation.  i like it so much thinking about getting another echo 2nd generation for my business room to play music.
1704,11,the walnut finish is a bit darker than expected but still very nice. the sound quality is not as good as i thought it was going to be. it is decent but first gen is definitely better.
1705,14,"the sound quality of this is much better than the ""dot"" (no surprise there!).  it may just be my placement of the device, but sometimes i need to issue a command twice before it works. ""alexa turn on lamps""... sometimes yields no response,other times says ""ok"", but nothing happens. 2nd try almost always works.i have integrated with tuya, hue and harmony hub, with moderate difficulty, but persistence pays off.  overall, great devices! making lists is super useful. the alexa ios app leaves a lot to be desired tho because of its poor performance!  please, please do a rev 2 on that app!"
1706,14,"as far as bluetooth speakers go, this is really good quality for the size and very comparable to other well speaker known brands. it is wired, so it must be plugged in to work. i¡¯ve used it both as alexa, set up with my prime & pandora accounts and also just connected to my phone via bluetooth and had 0 issues. alexa hears you really well even with loud music playing, and it is actually a little more handy than i thought!"
1707,9,"wow.  big hit in my family.  we use it all the time for news, weather, music.  we bought 2 small units so we have 3 around the house.  everyone in the house loves them..  amazing product amazon.  and i feel it is a great price for what you get.  the sound on the big unit is amazing."
1708,11,"works as well as alexa can, but the sound in the 1st generation i think is better. i do not like the volume buttons, the first generation has a ring on top, makes it much easier to adjust volume manually when unit is up out of the way of prying hand, the 2nd generation has push buttons on top so they are harder to reach. works well with 1st generation hub alexa."
1709,14,"i am having fun with this, have had to reconnect to my wi-fi once a day for first four days kept losing connection. doughnut have any problem with the dot that i purchased at the same time. it is a learning experience and the more i learn the more i am sure it will become useful. 4 out of five stars for the connectivity issue. oh by the way it is not bose but a good speaker."
1710,9,i have the first gen echo and bought this one for my son. the only complaint i have is that it is preloaded with my information since i purchased it.
1711,10,"we love this device. easy to use. as i hear a word, on tv, i dont understand, i ask alexa, and i expand my knowledge base!  the  daily tips are very useful in helping expand our world. voice calling, song library....all fantastic...thank you amazon for a great toll to help us old folks (75) to expand our intellectuality!"
1712,9,"i had noooooo idea how much i would enjoy my echo! easy to set up and even easier to use.alexa is response to my,  ""alexa.. good morning!"" always brings a smile to my face. :)i enjoyed my echo at home, so much, that i purchased one for my business, too.and the sound?! impeccably clear! even at volume 10! the sound quality blew me away!if you do not have one yet, for sure get one. if you have one, i recommend getting two!"
1713,14,"love love love love. one issue, i have one issue with this and its that i have a small house, so when i talk to one in one room often times several hear me. also, there are privacy issues, so i just say awful things at it just to be sure i am on every list as a true troll should be."
1714,10,"i love waking up in the morning to alexa softly playing music, or telling alexa to turn the lights off at night, or checking the weather before leaving out for work.  it eliminates the need for me to perform a google search.  i ask the question and alexa will provide the answer."
1715,14,"this is an amazing device that does what it is supposed to do. i see some of the complaints about sound quality but i was surprised at how good it really is. hey, it is $100 and little bigger than a soda can - not sure what you expect? setup was pretty straight forward. be warned that smart home add-ons from various sources may be a pain to set up but can not blame alexa for that. once they are set up, alexa controls them without fail. for me that is just light switches. i also added xm online to my account. alexa controls that perfectly. for $4/month you can subscribe to music unlimited (on the echo only). that is an absolute bargain in my opinion."
1716,14,"i sent it back. i have 2 of the echo dots and they work fine together. when i installed this one, it hijacked everything we requested from the dot and then a lot of features did not work, like it would not play music. no one in support could help, so i sent it back. software must be glitchy"
1717,14,"had a dot, and my folks have 2 echo is. got this specifically for my kitchen. i wore their is out over thanksgiving with song requests (thru prime unlimited...the bomb!!) and multiple food timers!"
1718,14,"you already know that this is a great tech for the house. i have this to my lovely girlfriend who is from brazil. i set it up and told her to say, alexa, play brazilian music¡±. the smile on her face was priceless as the music started. i have set up a couple of outlets and will install some light switches. it is really a cool thing. she lives it."
1719,10,the sound quality is fantastic! my family all sits together and plays games with our echo. it also gives us the chance to pick our favourite songs without having to do what we are doing.  we can fact check and get the latest info with just a voice command. i plan on getting one in every room.
1720,14,"we are still trying to discover all the uses of this great device, but weather and music alone are worth the price.  very responsive--no need to raise your voice .  would definitely buy again."
1721,14,"i have not heard every thing yet.  i like her to remind me to take my medication.  i like the design compared to others. my sister is buyingtwo this week.  i am still learning. my first one was a gift. i bought the second one.  when you use one and go to anothe room ,it picks thesame thing.  these would be great for nursing homes or a child is room. my sister is a psycotherapist who hates shopping but say if the correctmusic is playing, people buy more.  i am not writing this for publication.. i just wrote things i know. i have parkinson is and i know it not well written."
1722,14,"i have a first generation echo. i like this one a little better based on the size and style. it blends in better. it performs the same from what i can tell as the original. we use it mainly for listening to music. we use it to look stuff up once in a while and hear a news brief. overall it is nice to have one of these in a room for music. the sound quality is great and even with no real set up it will find music you like. if you take a little time on the amazon music site to pick your favorite music, you will get more of what you want. i recommend this product."
1723,14,afraid at first that this was a monster.  however with the app on the iphone it was a piece of cake to set up and start getting music in the home ..be aware that alexia is very sensitive to her name and you may have to whisper when she is in the room.  you get used to it readily and it is a great addition to a home.
1724,11,sound is not nearly as good as the original echo.  does not have the ability to turn the volume down by twisting the top either.  not nearly new and improved as i was expecting.
1725,14,"the aesthetic of the unit (smaller, less industrial than gen 1) and sound seem a lot better to me.  i¡¯d spent hours listening to a friend is gen 1 throughout 2017, so the contrast was there.  add that to the black friday price of $80 and you can not help but rationalize putting these throughout the house.  it is been a big help in the kitchen (for timers, reminders, in the fly facts, and the kids like asking alexa to tell jokes or play a game)."
1726,14,"its night and day going from a google home to the new echo. i have a harmony hub and it was getting tiresome to add additional verbiage to every command with google home to send to the harmony hub. i did some research and with the harmony hub skill for alexa you can just tell alexa what you want and it will do it. also, the fact that i can give it commands across the room or with the tv loud and not yell is amazing. love this thing!"
1727,10,"i am an elderly single guy.  alexa is like having a stepford wife in the house.  always pleasant, has a joke or two, plays my sirius 60 is, keepsmy calendar and shopping lists.  she never talks back!  wonderful.  she greets me in the am and wishes me to sleep well at night."
1728,14,bought this for my father (he is 80) to use with the smart plugs.  this really helps him navigate his home without having to leave lamps on all night.
1729,14,"i am a fan of the echo and it is capabilities. i on,y wish she could hear a little better. and sometimes you have to repeat the same phrase a few times over and over until she gets it right. but the price is right and if you have amazon prime there is little reason not to get one"
1730,10,"i love, love, love my echo.  i really did not have any expectations because i really did not know a lot about it.  i got echo as a gift.  the music is great. being able to talk to my husband in another part of the house is fantastic.  my very favorite part is being able to ask questions so easily.  this is a great product and once you have one, you would not want to be without it."
1731,0,"i like it the most because i can get it to play almost every song i want by just calling it out, including entire albums. what i do not like, the fact that when i ask it if it is recording everything i say in the house and sending it to the nsa, it just shuts down and does not answer."
1732,14,"its a cool device. the problem comes when you are playing something either on device or another source such as a laptop. than voice recognition is severely affected. sometimes i have to repeat myself three times to get a respond or sometimes yell at it, pretty much like my ex. i am afraid that long term anger issues and angry neighbor are some of the side effects.it should at least filter the sound which it is playing so that voice command can be heared by device internal microphones."
1733,10,the echo fits in with our decor beautifully. it was a gift from the kids and they wanted us to become more modern...and we have!! we love the ease of finding out things and playing our favorite music. it does so much that i really do not take advantage of all it has to offer even though we get updates all the time. we just love all  that alexa can do!! the grand kids think we are cool now!!
1734,14,"for playing music this thing is great. i love the sound quality. i like being able to ask for a type of music and having it play without any hassles.the home automation features are nice as well. i bought an led bulb which i installed in a lamp. once you give the lamp a name, you can turn it on and off with voice commands."
1735,9,"bought this as an xmas gift for our daughter and they love it. my son-in-law works for lutron so they already had lighting control that were compatible with alexa. we also got them a dot for the 2nd floor and they are working well together. seems they learn a new ""trick"" every day."
1736,14,"i have 3 of these spread over the house so i can listen to music and get information where ever i am. i constantly have my hands in something so the voice recognition is perfect when your hands are dirty. the sound quality is impressive and can fill the house with the same music where ever i go. i was contemplating a sonos system but for the price of one speaker i was able to get 3 units. this has also brought me closer together with my family as i can now speak to my brother over 4000 miles away without expensive bills, last week we were on a call for over an hour with the whole family and not a cent."
1737,14,"the speaker does not sound as good as i hoped. i¡¯ve heard a gen 1 and remember it sounding noticeably better (deeper bass, fuller sound). i¡¯ve been waiting for the echo to update itself, but it has not yet. it is been a week. i¡¯ve tried to force an update using the mute technique, but that has not worked. considering returning it for an echo dot and using an external speaker."
1738,10,my new best friend. how did i ever live without this!? i bought it for my pilates studio and it is perfect for a small space. we use it for music and absolutely love that we can play anything by voice command!
1739,10,"i love the echo! i can find out what the temperature and weather forecast is in the morning. also, i can ask alexa to check my calendar, which is nice. i listen to npr and amazon music too and can hear anything that i like. i¡¯m very glad that i bought this and it is worth every penny!"
1740,9,"xmas gift: got this for my wife to listen to amazon music in the kitchen.we also got dots for the bedrooms. we use as intercom system between rooms, to control lighting, wake up alarms, music & even playing lullabies for the kids to help calm them to sleep.everyone in the household loves them!"
1741,14,"this is a novelty more then anything. we have been trying to build its skill level but it takes allot of time. most questions are asked! do i think its worth the money no so much, but what do you get for that kind of chance these day. our grandson get a kick out of it?"
1742,9,"the echo was so easy to set up and use. i think the sound when playing music is amazing and alexa is always helpful!! everyone in my house has found features that help them.  echo makes integration of home devices a breeze. just for music alone it would be worth the money but i have found so many other uses, it just keeps amazing me."
1743,14,"it is fun and useful, not at all necessary. the music catalog is ok, you have to subscribe to get a fuller version. the fart noises are funny, but only for a day or so. the reminders are great. be sure to play jeopardy. we have not utilized the home control yet but plan to."
1744,9,i love this thing. after buying my daughter an echo dot last year and falling in love with the echo is. the speaker system is better on this one.
1745,14,the speaker quality is amazing. i have not utilized alexa all that much so i can not speak to that end of it. reindeer jokes are as corny as can be.
1746,10,"it has brought music back into my life.... so far that is the best feature, the ease of playing music with a voice command.i wish there was support for other languages, specifically portuguese.i need to spend more time learning some commands to use it for more than just music"
1747,10,"i enjoyed this so much i now have 3.  i especially like the group play setting, being able to listen to the same source channel through the house."
1748,14,"this thing definitely has a long way to go in terms of functionality. it randomly does not work and says ""i am not sure what went wrong"" when it previously worked just fine. restarting the device does not seem to help either. it will also randomly start talking when no one has said a trigger word. additionally, the sdk for alexa skills is pretty terrible and extremely limiting."
1749,11,"not bad but not great. sounds quality is good, much better than the dot, has crisp sound and good bass but the features are not what i expect."
1750,10,"i am obsessed, the best ever. i do not know how i ever lived without it. i pretty much delegate all of my parenting responsibilities now to alexa- alexa set the alarm to wake son up, alexa read a story to daughter, alexa- how to you spell (whatever), its such a dream"
1751,14,"great sound quality and can get very loud, it picks up on my voice commands a little to well because sometimes if i am watching tv it will pick up the voices off tv and start playing songs which is not a big deal its easy to shut off. it connected to my spotify premium really easy and plays music from there. it has way to many features that i can barely keep track of and i know i do not take advantage of most of them. i plan on investing in the light bulbs because who does not love being lazy and not having to get up to turn off the lights. i would highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a quality speaker that has more features than just bluetooth music playing."
1752,9,we purchased echo and 3 echo dots and my husband and i are enjoying music all through our downstairs and in our bedroom. we also purchased another echo dot for my son and his family to increase their listening choices. this is absolutely the most enjoyable purchase we have made recently.
1753,14,"so far we like it. we are excited to see it expand to control other electronic gadgets. we hope that it will be comparable with voice commands for the tv is etc.  has a nice sound. not ""bose"" quality but very good for the price!  all in all it was a very good purchase!"
1754,9,i bought one of these for my sister and one for my brother for christmas.  they both are very pleased with them and say they work great.  because i also have an alexa device we are able to drop in on each other even though we live in 3 different states.  a very good product.
1755,11,"sound quality when first setup was disappointing. but after firmware update i was pleasantly surprised by the improvement in sound quality, sounds better than 1st generation. mic sensitivity seems to be about the same as 1st generation. they should make skin replacements less expensive."
1756,14,"the (2nd generation) echo surpassed my expectations.  not only is the sound great, but it is very easy to use.  no training required, simply plug it in, wait a couple of minutes for it to boot up and away you go.  after receiving mine, i bought one for my son and he loves it as well."
1757,0,"still so much to learn and play with, but it is been fun.  i am guessing it will make it is way up to 5 stars...but there are so many different things, that i just do not know about/what to use/how to use with it yet.  i do have to say that i do not like the 'try this with alexa....but then if you want to continue, you have to pay or enroll in amazon prime, etc...' that is irritating.  but what i have tried is educational, interesting and fun!  love the ability to play whatever song when i want!"
1758,14,purchased this model to use in the bedroom. have a first generation model in the kitchen. set-up identical to first generation. same usefulness in both rooms. they are far enough away from one another so there is no issue in having them both go on at the same time.
1759,0,"alexa does not seem to be able to tell u much at all. you can ask her any question or tell her to order you something, but it is likely she will not be able to tell you an answer. she is not able to search the internet easily. good for setting alarms and she will tell you the weather....but not very helpful otherwise."
1760,14,mine keeps having a green flashing ring. when i look this up it says it is because it has lost its connection with the internet or it is an incoming call. yet neither is true and there does not seem to be any kind of readily apparent customer service at amazon to be able to address this issue.
1761,9,"my husband and i received the new echo as a christmas gift from our children. we loveit! we have played games with it, constantly ask questions and of course play music. my 91 year old mom even uses it! i order my amazon orders through it ... what a time saver. as a matter a fact we even ordered one for my husbands sister and she loves it too. we also have used it to talk to the grandchildren since they have one too."
1762,0,"alexa is less than perfect and has given me a few ""i do not know"" answers and still has a 'limited' music library.  otherwise, she can be very helpful and often fun.  the improved sound is very nice.  she is learning every day so someday these little things will be fixed."
1763,9,"so far love this! have not figured out how to sync it with my firestick, but i also have not really tried. it is paired with smart plugs that controls my living room and bedroom lights. love this feature!"
1764,10,"i am very pleased with my echo.  although i have not set up a number of things i am enjoying my favorite radio station, reminders, selecting music and asking questions.  i know there is so much more ""alexa"" is capable of and i look forward to increasing my usage."
1765,14,"i have this hooked up to dish, my lamps and my best. turn on my sons lamp when it is time for school, setup is not hard but could be easier. looking forward to more alexa devices as this catches on!this device could save a senior citizens life! if you fall just call out to it!"
1766,11,"my wife and i have really enjoyed both of our echo devices and this one is excellent!  i do miss the remote and volume dial that came with the first generation device, but the price is significantly less.  sound quality?  i can not really tell the difference and they both sound great!"
1767,14,"initial set was touch and go.  could not get it to connect to the internet through my browsers.  downloaded the app on my phone and made my connection immediately. i like the design.  very compact.  the sound is very clear and good bass. once i got connected, i was able to connect to favorite music stations and news.  alexa has fun did you know facts. happy with my purchase."
1768,14,the second generation is nowhere near as reliable. voice recognition is terrible when music is playing. should have just stuck with the first generation.
1769,14,"good sound quality; does not always pick the correct radio station when asked to play one of our local radio stations.  think of a weird song and ask alexa to play it, she may just be able to find it but if not, you have to subscribe to a paid service to listen.  funny how sometimes if you are having a conversation in the next room, all of a sudden we will hear, ""i am sorry, i did not understand that."" and we had not even asked her anything.  all in all, interesting second generation digital assistant but for true convergence really needs to mesh with personal calendars across a range of phones and accounts."
1770,14,"sound quality is good for a small speaker. nice a digital hub for the house. i have my anova sous vide machine linked to it so i can know what it is doing from anywhere. alexa is good for weather, timers & news. however, she is not so good with simple questions. you may as for a history topic, and she will reply with a playlist from amazon music..."
1771,14,i am loving my echo.  i had a little difficulty setting up but that was on me...i kept overlooking the part of putting in the router password!  the sound is amazing and i am loving the hands-free operation in the kitchen and the seemingly unlimited choice of music options.  the voice recognition is definitely superior to siri who often does not understand.  i will definitely be adding on.
1772,11,"thought 2nd gen speaker was a big improvement over gen 1, not so"
1773,11,but this model although it is sounds good has some trouble hearing well. it is placed right where older one was but is not a responsive.
1774,14,"i have the 1st generation and love it.  unfortunately the 2nd generation does not work well with spotify.  it stops playing all the time and you have to reset it to get it to work again.  it is a huge pain for spotify users.  i thought it was a problem with the echo itself so i exchanged it and am still having a problem.  maybe if they get this glitch worked out, i will rate it better.  stick with the 1st generation if you are a spotify user."
1775,10,"i bought this for my mom who is a senior citizen...  she is not a technology buff like me, but it is so easy for her to use... she love listing to music but queuing songs up by simply saying things like ""place relaxing music""  ""play dinner music""  etc..."
1776,14,"i have two echo dots, and got this new echo because i wanted better sound.  this speaker sounds about 10% better than my dot.  it is nice looking, though.  i wish i could have had the opportunity to try one out before i bought it, because i would not have bought it in the first place.  it still functions perfectly, but the sounds it super mediocre.  and i am not an audiophile by any means.buy this only if the dot do not do what you need."
1777,10,"it is so handy to time my eye drops, use as a news brief in the morning, and the humor is good, real ""punny"".  it would such a wonderful device for a paraplegic since all the commands are voice activated. i wish it had been available several years ago when my friend was alive.fun gadget for shopping lists too and just some general trivia. i also enjoy the jeopardy and other games it provides."
1778,14,pretty much the same at the 1st edition echo. has all the same stuff and what not. i had no problems at all with my echo and i am very happy with it. the only down side i can possibly think of it the fact that it is not wireless with means it needs to be plugged into a wall outlet to use. and if you want to use all the smart house features you are gonna be spending alot more to do so. that is about it
1779,14,"sound quality is not better with this. i also have an original echo and a dot and would say the sound is in between. definitely does not live up to the hype. it does seem to hear me better with background noise such as the tv which is the only reason i am going to give it a chance and also the reason it gets 2 stars instead of 1. if you are buying this, like i did, expecting great room filling sound, i would skip it and spend the money on a new or refurb original echo."
1780,0,"great at playing a limited music selection: you need to have a subscription to a music service. good for weather, jokes, poems and the like. does not like questions about the cia, government or if someone else is listening.does not understand or pretends not understand some questions."
1781,0,love alexa but she is a little rusty when i asked for nadia is music she does not have it she needs to be upgraded little bit by then that i love her and it is hard to get international music in there i have to learn how to talk to a different words i guess it is pretty good love the speaker great sound
1782,14,debating on a 3 or 4 star rating.4 stars for speaker sound. 3 starsbecause alexa gets confused every once in a whileevery week. it is connected to my smart outlets so she can turn on my light or fan. for examplei asked it to turn on master lights. what does she do ?she starts to play linger by the cranberries oye!all in all it is a decent item to have to play your favorite songs.
1783,14,"it is ok but i am disappointed that i can not play my own music through it.  there is no input, and  amazon no longer permits uploading music, so i am stuck listening to whatever music amazon selects for me.  i would not buy it again for this reason.  blue tooth works well with my sound bar and other devices, but my mp3 player is not blue tooth enabled, and neither is my computer.  there is got to be a work-around for this but so far i have been unable to figure it out."
1784,14,i bought this as a gift for my dad who loves gadgets but does not want a bs item collecting dust. he absolutely loved it! calls come in clearer than speakerphone for both android and iphone. he loves all the features and plans to get more for other rooms in his home. i now plan to get one for myself as well after seeing it in action.
1785,14,so they made it bigger but no rechargeable battery always has to have power. should of just sent back 1st gen. and got one that worked better the only nice thing is that it does not keep loosing wifi signal. and a little louder . but it has to stay at home can not take on bike ride or ln-line skating
1786,14,the sound output rocks for a $80 device.........alexa is confirmation voice can be loud and annoying at times. she talks too much! lmao.
1787,14,"quality of sound goes significantly down as volume goes up. when using as speaker phone for phone calls, friends on the other line stated there was static and an ¡°echo.¡±  ( no pun intended).  i returned to the item. i was told by customer service the item must have had a defect as this was not normally experienced by echo users. i¡¯ve since purchased another echo 2nd generation device and once it arrives my rating may or may not change."
1788,14,"i bought this as a christmas gift for a friend.  he was not able to activate it.  no mater what he did, it would not connect to the internet.  we had at least 3 other people try to get it to work, people who are more experienced with electronics that we were.  they failed as well.  finally we gave up.  the window to return it was january 31.  at that point we were still hopeful we would get it working.  never happened and now we can not return it.  ihave to say this is the worst experience i have ever had with amazon.julie johnson"
1789,9,"sound is terrific and new outer cover very nice as well as its smaller size.  .  i use it primarily for music and smart home.  love ordering amazon products just by telling alexa to do it.  the alex a skills are amazing with news briefs, local weather and so much more.  love it."
1790,14,"just bought one for my apartment - i love it! only issue is sometimes it has trouble recognizing my boyfeiend is commands even though he has his account sync¡¯d up as well. and for some reason when i ask what is on my calendar for the day, it says nothing even though i have something scheduled (i¡¯ve tried my icloud calendar plus google calendars, and have tried selecting different calendars for it to read from and it still does not work)."
1791,14,"so far, so good. we had some difficulty connecting to wi-fi but i chatted with amazon technical dept. and they guided me through it.  it is so far, a handy device for music, for reminders, news and weather. we have only had it for three or four days so there is so much more to learn and do with alexa."
1792,14,"great sound, not real easy to set up, but it did not take long.  directions were worthless to set up.  had to play around with it.  sometimes, she does not respond (less than 5% of time) & sometimes (rarely) she chooses a different music network than pandora which i set up.  do love the ease of use & sound quality!  please put together a better beginning instruction book!"
1793,14,this was an impulse purchase but i am glad i did it.  i used to play pandora on my smart tv.  no longer.  the speaker is as good as the tv is.  i just wish my kids had one of these so i could contact them.  continually learning new features
1794,0,what i like most is the sound in the music that i can pick from but it cost extra a month to have that access. what i like least is that it does not always know the question i am asking or i have not asked the question correctly it takes some time to get used to using it
1795,14,"good quality speaker. sound is just as good as my bose bluetooth speaker. links to amazon music, pandora, and couple of other music streaming services. you can have alexa play it or you can control with your smartphone using the alexa app. it also works well with fire tv."
1796,0,"hey, using echo for very simple tasks and does just as expected, but there is a slight learning curve.  however, it is kind of fun.  cool device."
1797,0,"good job, we love it.  i like everything about it and more, and that is a lot of things as i am learning.  the only thing i do not like is that i bought the wand that goes with it, and although it will take vocal commands like turn on the lights, it will not take a command to play a song or change the volume on the music.  i guess that is a fault of the wand and not the echo.  all that said i do love the echo and would highly recommend it to everyone.  by the way i do feel compelled to say thank you to alexis.  it just does not seem right not to do so."
1798,14,"it looked lovely and played well for less then one hour, then it lost the wifi connection and was unable to connect online again so i had it returned.  i felt sorry to have to return it, as it is rather heavy.  but i am keeping the echo dot ordered with the echo."
1799,14,"the sound is amazing for such a small device.do not get me wrong, it is not equivalent to a hifi home stereo system, but you also can just ask a home system to play whatever fits your mood. it also looks great in the new fabric covering. we already had an echo dot and loved the capabilities of alexa, but we wanted this specifically for the music playback and it has more than met our expectations."
1800,14,"to add to our growing echo family, we added the 2nd gen echo.  so, without being windy here, it is alexa.  very helpful with smart homes, and great for music.  the sound quality on this unit is not amazing, but has good quality overall, and can get quite loud without distortion."
1801,14,"echo has many skills, i am able to control my tv and two smart sockets.  but echo was so so to answer questions.there is a bug, when i ask echo to change channel on my tv, the app changed source to cable from antenna, i have to change the tv source back to antenna."
1802,14,"i live my alexa. next i am going to buy the alexa buttons so my friends, family and i can play games. so much fun. basically able to do anything hands free. only thing that i dont like is all extensions must be downloaded to phone (which in turn if you got all extensions- would be a lot of extra space taken up on phone), plus phone blue tooth has to be one so if phone is not in home, extensions will not work. (extensions should not be extra apps and work when phone is not there- work on that it will be perfect)"
1803,14,"i can not compare the second generation to the first because i never had the first one. however, this one is really good! i like the sound although it does not compare to my bose speaker.  i¡¯m still learning the ins and outs of the echo. i wish there was a way to set up a playlist. if anyone can help, please do."
1804,0,still learning how to use this happy so far could have a few easier short cuts to re enter set up info still trying to figure that out
1805,14,"i am a harsh reviewer. i read the ""bad sound"" reviews and was expecting the worst.shazzam, this thing sounds great to me. i do not understand why it is getting bad reviews.it normally takes a speaker about 90 hours to reach full excursion, so i expect this device to get better and better.yes, i can simultaneously play all four echos  in my house at once.bitchin'.what is not to like?"
1806,11,"have had an echo 1 for quite a while. this one is smaller and louder, better sound quality, and looks nicer. i do like the original rotating volume knob but the push buttons work just fine. old one is in bathroom since its loud enough to hear over shower. new one is in kitchen."
1807,14,"it is a lot of funbut annoying when it disconnects from the internet.and sound really is not great. flat, no depth, and no bass.bose sound better."
1808,0,"the speaker is amazing!  i like many of the options alexa offers but sometimes i must word the question incorrectly because she does not quite get it.i wish there was an option to rename her because every time my daughter mentions her cousin is name, guess who answers!?!"
1809,11,"sounds great but not that much of an improvement. it is smaller than the last, and the outside has a totally diff feel etc. just like info says. it works as well as other and i dont need much of a difference unless i really pay attention. so upgrading really has no reason to."
1810,0,"i like alexa and all the things she does, like make phone calls, play music and answer questions. only skimming the surface now, i know, and may not ever be able to take full advantage of all functions -- but that is my limited ability and not alexa is fault. love this speaker."
1811,10,"i am not using it to its full capacity, because i do not order groceries from amazon, and i do not have the smart tv device, but other than it is cool. i love that i can say just about any type of music, and it begins to play. a couple of times though, like just this morning, alexa would not recognize my voice. i could not even get her to play music this morning, let alone get my headlines and weather for the day."
1812,9,"it has great sound.  i was expecting to have to connect to an external speaker, but i love the sound quality as it is.  now it is not disco boom but great for my needs. i love music and l need for it to sound great.  everyone who has come to my house and heard it loves it and wants to get their own."
1813,0,alexa seems to have difficulty understanding us at times and it is very frustrating. we ask the same thing after a few hours and she gets it.
1814,9,we have multiple echo is in the house and use them for all sorts of smart home control. the 2nd gen has great sound that can be heart throughout most of the house and being able to link them with other echos so we can have the same music playing in different rooms is awesome.
1815,14,"the sound quality is exceptional for something that takes up so little space.  after the last update the bass improved quite a bit.  i enjoy being able to stream my favorite music and, then add things to my grocery list.  this one is in my kitchen and i just love it."
1816,14,i use the echo a lot for music.  the 2nd generation has improved the sound quality immensely.  doing that while maintaining and improving the echos features and capabilities has made this devise a true joy for me!  the echos just seem to get better and better!! i love mine!!
1817,14,"very fast and music sound is amazing. fills the house with music. i got it at $79.99 and i am very pleased. planning to get another one, once the price drops again. do yourself a favor and get one now!"
1818,11,i bought this as a gift but i do not really see the difference in sound quality from the two 1st generation echos i have in my home.
1819,14,nice. one thing i do not like is the new power supply. all my other amazon devices have a mini or micro usb you guys know what i mean. it is so easy for me to find a cable or charger. amazon changed this to a dedicated bayonet type connector. it is a bit like what apple does. i do not get it.
1820,9,"we have echo dots in our family room and all our bedrooms.  decided to get the echo for the living room, so no speaker was needed when listening to music or such. the kids love playing trivia with it. my husband gets the news and weather.  absolutely well worth the money!!!"
1821,14,"bought as a christmas gift for my sibling. she has not used it much, but speaker did sound loud enough on initial test. i think the value of echo will increase once more apps begin to integrate it locally and amazon releases future updates that better utilizes the echo systems"
1822,14,echo just gets better and better the more you use her. kind of an all-knowing friendly partner when no one else can stand the mood i am in.
1823,14,"love my alexa!  we talk and play games , since my mom has one and they are very sensitive, mine has a different name, echo. or there would be conversations going on between them. i did have the echo first but the sound quality is bad you would have to buy an external speaker for them so the bigger one is the best buy for your money!"
1824,9,i bought 8 of these between the 2nd generation and the dot for christmas gifts this year!  everyone who received one was excited and anxious to get their is programed and running.  i bought one for me first and then bought as gifts for our kids families. it was a gift choice we knew they probably would not buy for themselves.  one of those gifts that fit each family perfectly.  ty
1825,10,i love it. i hate that you are making me subscribe to amazon music to get all my favs but hey as bad as that is alexa is a welcome addition to my home.
1826,14,"this amazon echo is a lot of fun. it has given me new challenges and ideas in my daily life. i enjoy how it exercise is my brain and can answer comment questions. however, it seems to be lacking in some fundamental seemingly easy questions and searches. i cannot help but wonder if the google product is better in some areas. i look forward to the upgrades in future use of this product. overall, i am quite satisfied with my amazon echo."
1827,14,"first things first, they do not have better audio than the previous echo, not even better than the echo tap.  the inferior audio would force me to use the auxiliary port to connect to a decent sound system which means, i could save $50 and buy a echo dot to accomplish the same thing.there is nothing to justify the $100 price tag.  i bought 3 expecting a great product and to take advantage of the $50 off promo, and personally, they¡¯re still not worth it.  i am returning them immediately."
1828,9,"love this thing..got it after i was attacked by a falling christmas tree and realized i needed a way to call my neighbors or kids for help without having a phone handy. i am way too young for a ""life alert"" so i got this--the extra stuff  it does is a pleasant surprise!"
1829,14,i think once we figure it out it will be fine but it was not the most user friendly situation for sure. it still is not right because she knows nothing unless i suggest. a specific song and then i had to go on and buy songs. probably something we do not have synced. i have not spent a lot of time on it but mostly because of frustration. all the advertising sounds simple
1830,14,"i bought this for my parents. now when i visit them, they speak to alexa more than they speak to me. i am 41 years old and looking to be adopted by someone who does not have the echo. i am tidy, and do not require very much. i will even live in your shed. please love me."
1831,10,"i love this petite size, quality sound and personal assistant.  i love listening to podcasts, music, news, etc.  my hubby has dementia and can ask ""echo"" what time it? what day is it?  what tie is the nfl football game on, etc.  takes the burden off of me.  love, love, love it!!!!"
1832,14,i have both an echo and a dot and the echo seems much better at hearing voices with other noise in the room. it takes a little while to learn to use the features and you need to spend some time adding skills to make it more useful to your specific needs but it is a lot of fun and really handy to have.
1833,9,love alexa!  great sound!  i have one in my front room and one in my bedroom.  i was thinking about getting a bose sound bar... but i do not need it because the echo has such great sound!  we have connected her to my nest and smart light bulbs!  love this technology!
1834,10,"gift from our kids for chrismas...we love it..we play variety of music during the day, every day, give her a thumbs up for longs we like....ask questions, set alarms for meds, wake up to music, set timers, etc....easy to set up, sounds great, alexa makes us laugh.."
1835,11,"we have the original echo which is taller and in my opinion sounds better. the 2nd gen is almost as good as far as sound but not quite. bass is not as good. i also miss the volume ""ring"" that you turn to adjust volume. lower price compared to the original echo."
1836,14,"we now have five echo devices in our house and two at my mother-in-law is place. for the second time in about two months, my mother-in-law has needed to summon help from us. she could not get to her phone, but she was able to call us alexa-to-alexa. it was terrific. we even were able to speak with paramedics who arrived at the house before we could get there.sound quality on the 2nd gen models is great. despite some concerns that alexa is taking over the universe, we really find great value, quality, etc. in the amazon echo devices."
1837,11,"sound is better than the 1st generation but not by much. it has a deeper sound. how ever its suppose to listen better but i think the 1st generation was better. it also takes longer to communicate your commands, so lights take longer to come on."
1838,14,"so far, this device lives up to the hype!!! i am a electronic technician, and electronic specialist, when you buy electronics, the company like amazon is will offer a warranty, that is not to waist your money, that is to save you money, if you buy anything electronic more than $10, i would strongly advise you to buy the warranty, i am more than qualified to give this advice, i used to build electronics for a living!!! when i bought this product, i even purchased the warranty!!! god bless you, and please take my advice!"
1839,9,this alexa does everything you would imagine and more. truly the best home assistant. i can not wait for the day when i can afford to buy all the smart home equipment. if your skeptical on this and others like google and apples this is the best one. i will be gifting every family member one when the time comes as long as they do not already own after witnessing use in my home.
1840,14,"speakers is much better than the echo dot but can be improved a little bit.  love the smart home integration.  it is very easy compared to ifttt.  i am able to connect my wemo switches and sengled hub for my leds with no issues.  even on full volume, it can easily detect the wake up word, alexa.  would love to get more answers on q and a.  i read it is using the bing search engine.  hope they can integrate google as well but that would be too much wishful thinking considering they are competitors."
1841,9,can not say enough about this device dad is legally blind now he asks for news music and so on this has been a life saver for him  made him happy
1842,14,"the alexa software still has some frustrating limitations, but i was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the speaker on this. unless you already have great speakers that will connect well to alexa, i would definitely say it is worth it to buy the echo instead of the dot."
1843,1,"fun and entertaining, this is the second generation, sounds are fantastic when playing music, sounds like you are at the concert."
1844,14,"this is an awesome device with great sound and better yet awesome respond, you don have to speak clear english to be able to communicate with alexa and she can hear you even when play in high volume. the bluetooth capability is awesome either and the set up is not bad."
1845,10,i gave this as a gift after receiving one myself. we love the echo and like how we can take it to different rooms with no set up time! we can set the music to play while we cook in the kitchen then turn on relaxation sounds in the bedroom while falling asleep. very versatile gadget that i know we will continue to find new uses for!
1846,14,"this is our 4th echo (2 full sized, and 2 dots) and its the best sounding of them all. its really impressive the sound that comes out of it. the function of the echo itself (alexa) is great. a normal morning with music and news helps keep track of current events."
1847,14,"this product is more than excellent. i¡¯ve been very impressed with what alexa can do. today when i was showering, i was using the echo to play music. i had it placed on the counter next to the shower. in the shower, i asked it to play the next song and it did. i also asked it to add the song to my library and it did. still was able to recognize its name and my voice over the shower noice. did not have to peak my head of the shower or anything."
1848,14,this thing is really a piece of junk.  it does not recognize anything we say.  it comes up with off the wall stuff.  i regret buying it.
1849,14,installation was horrible and support was just as bad.  why do we have to outsource all customer service to countries that can barely speak english or their accent is so bad you continually say..excuse me?
1850,14,"works well, although we have been disappointed that some responses to our questions refer us to amazon to purchase something.  an example was a request to play a sample of led zeppelin music.  other music we can request and get, but not this one and several others."
1851,14,upon getting my echo i was impressed by the sound quality more than anything else! although this was not what i needed as i have a stereo system i would be using. since i found this to be a great standalone i decided to purchase multiple echo dots for my home and gave my echo as a present!
1852,14,very nice unit.  perfect for any apartment or full size living room.  good bass but still not as effective as an actual sub obviously.  kids love to talk to her.  i love these things.  i have a first and second gen echo and two dots for the kids rooms.
1853,14,i am very impressed with the sound quality. with her size; i was pleasantly surprised.  she is alooking has good voice recognition.  she even understands my children; 5 and 3years. she also does a decent job filtering through noise.i am disappointed in her lack of knowledge.  my kids ask my phone questions daily. like wikipedia type questions.  what do giraffes eat etc. she always says she does not know. i have also asked her to read ingredients of a recipe and she will tell me to go buy a jar. so not super helpful there and i usually end up grabbing for my phone. i would recommend her to a friend looking for a good quality speaker.
1854,14,does not play nicely with first generation echo in multi room music. also sometimes makes a loud hiss noise before executing a command.
1855,14,gets the job done! loving the alexa device. syncing it to other smart devices. i wish the sound quality was better or at least more base.
1856,14,"echo is very responsive and alexa really understands me.music plays loud and clear right from the built in speakers, or you can easily connect to a bt speaker system. (like sonos)i love echo and i can not wait until i can control my tivo is with alexa."
1857,11,"excellent sound, frankly i was surprised when i saw how compact this product is! the sound is so good i bought two more to spread around the house. the sound is deeper and richer, by far, than i expected. i highly recommend this echo, can not say much more."
1858,14,"i like it, but still getting used to what she is (alexa) do. i still have not figured out how to set up my phone contacts so i can use it to make calls??? any ideas? also not impressed with the speaker sound when playing music. i also ended up buying a couple more for bedrooms."
1859,14,"great item overall.  after 3 of them at the house, i still cannot find a flaw in the construction.  great sound quality, great size, great look.  conservative ellegant, and looks great no matter where.  the alexa feature is a splendid tool that works perfect for any mood.  the various color options provide a very decor specific option for whatever environment you may think.  the only detail that i would improve, would be to be able to  synchronize all units available when used as bluetooth speaker.  but i¡¯m aware that it could be due to limitations on the bluetooth platform.  great unit, and i will continue to add more  throughout the house and yard."
1860,14,"bought one without reading reviews, because i already had one. used it for two days & put it back in the box. my first echo goes back on the pedestal!"
1861,14,"i love this echo. it is far better than i ever imagined. i love to read and now when i come across a word i do not know, i get a definition and pronunciation instantly. it plays soothing sounds of my choice when i go to bed and shuts itself off. i think the sound is excellent."
1862,14,"i have two of these and have found them to be very good. not saying the sound is as good as a sonos, but for what i use it for it is perfect."
1863,14,i liked the sound and friendly voice of alexa.  install was a little tough to install.  i got help from your friendly customer service.  the manual was provided by echo was to small.  tried to find  a manual on line but did not find one to download
1864,14,"so far i am enjoying trying the different features - the sound quality is great for music.  the volume on the alarms (alexa, set a  timer for 10 minutes) is almost inaudible.  i have to figure out how to raise this volume level.  but, so far so good!"
1865,14,"i was so excited to receive my echo but have been very disappointed and now decided to return the item to amazon. i have spent many hours trying to get my echo to connect to my at&t wifi. i have even called amazon/echo tech support for assistance, yet my echo still will not connect. i wish i had researched before we bought this item because many people with at&t have had the same problem as me with connection."
1866,10,"i received the echo & echodot as a birthday present. i love listening to my music, speakers are fantastic, i can talk on the phone & ask any queation that pops up. i love the size of the echo dot the best, it is small and inconspicuous. overall both are 5 stars for me."
1867,14,"truly love the 2nd generation of echo. from the first second i got it out of the box i have been using it nonstop. audio is crisp from my unit, i do not see other people is complaints with mine. alexa is so responsive and has no lag time. buy this for christmas and you will make someone very happy. do not pass this up or you will be sorry."
1868,14,"i am totally shocked at the performance of my. it does exactly what my other echo does. i see no difference between the two, but my first alexa is taller than the other. on a scale of one to five (five being best) i will give it a twenty-five. ""it is that good."""
1869,0,this is the best thing i have ever had.  so responsive and i just love being able to think of a song or musical artist or type of music that i want to hear and then just ask for it and she delivers!  so easy to set up and use.  i am currently only utilizing a percentage of her value as i do not have her hooked up to lights and appliances yet!
1870,14,"ok..so i am not big on having these type of devices in my home, but the new 2nd gens are really amazing. it saves my family so much money. here is how..we have been wanting to install and intercom system in the house and everything out there is soooo expensive. and we wanted to have  multi room music, which is also an expensive purchase.installing these in the home i have both and i can also talk directly to any echo at my home from my cell!! so i spent $200 for 2 echos which is less than 1 intercom unit! never turning back!"
1871,14,"love the sound. although i wish the alarm was louder. also i purchased amazon music unlimited for the house as the kids got echo dots.  since you can only play one at a time with amazon music. that was a terrible idea. there are no parental blocks for the music so that was cancelled immediately. amazon said they may add that option later, but it is not available now. but if you add pandora or i heart radio then they all can play. 5 stars for the echo products. 0 stars for amazon unlimited music"
1872,14,"this device is so much fun! the first days you love it for the novelty, then it becomes indispensable if you like music and news."
1873,14,"along with the sonos 1, i own an amazon echo.  i was really surprised and impressed with the sound quality of the echo, but i wanted to add additional alexa capabilities to multiple rooms, thus assumed the sonos would be an upgrade.  unfortunately, the sound differential does not justify the additional cost of the sonos.  i am about best bang for buck...the echo is sound performance is just a notch under the sonos, and for $85, the echo is much easier on the wallet."
1874,14,"we mostly use for music, which is so great to just say play this or that and it does.  have been getting reacquainted with older songs i have not heard in awhile because it was too much trouble to go find before.  we are waiting on the same christmas sale and going to buy a few more for bedrooms."
1875,9,"we have four 1st gen echos at home, one 1st gen at our offices, and now four 2nd gen also at the offices.  awesome.  they understand us, are reliable, and work well with two different automation systems (different ones at home and office).  i have even purchased one for an elderly friend, who also loves it."
1876,0,no  sense of humorgoogle and bixby have more entertaining answersafter several months having some sound issues. plus surprised how many questions are misunderstood or not answered at all.may return if sound continues to get worse.
1877,14,this is the second echo for my home.  it does not respond as well as the original and the alexa app on my kindle fire will have me go into ¡°echo set-up¡± within 1 hour of completing setup.  i have verified and updated apps on my fire.  this may be a learning curve for both me and the second echo but so far not impressed.
1878,14,it is not to smart....answers half my questions in fact now that i think about it..alexia is a bone headed idiot ...the music and sound is pretty good if you wanna pay 4 bucks a month...and alexia can cut a pretty good wet fart...yes she will fart if you ask her too.....just like my wifewhat i found it good for was to ask what the weather is outside...my wife just sticks her head out the window ...same results...so if amazon comes out with an echo you can have sex with and cooks..the wife is outta here..noooo i am only kidding...it does not  have to cook.. ..
1879,0,these are my 7th set of echo for my house. great sound!!!!!  i still think the apps are limited but for music you cant beat it.
1880,14,"love it. i have a 200-gallon reef tank mounted into my living room wall. when i relax and watch my reef i have my echo, ""alexa"" play ocean sounds as background music. hypnotises me. love my echo. will be purchasing a second echo. highly recommend<u+200b>."
1881,14,i so love my evho.. alexa is wonderful...  we had a power outage last week and it affected alexa and i could not connect to wifi..  i called amazon and talked to two amazing young men who arrived at the conclusion that she needed to be either fixed or exchanged... gotta appreciate the customer service at amazon!
1882,0,she does the weather fine. she can play any fm radio station that i ask for. sound quality is really pretty good. you can set volume manually or verbally. she can call anyone in my contacts completely hands free. i can search my prime video or fire tv with her verbally. her jokes are really really bad. so far when i ask for the price of local regular gasoline she is way off the mark. she has a good alarm clock timer app. probably tons of apps and skills i have not uncovered yet.
1883,10,"i have a new assistant her name is alexa. she has a 100% on time rate, no sick days or sick kids. she multi task, has a great attitude.  keeps track of my list, timers, the weather, my favorite music, she reminds me of appts and appts that need to be made. she has a sense of humor, tells jokes and sings to me. she is great at history, science, math, the judicial system and the workings of the federal government. i am absolutely happy wirh alexa and how she has enhanced my daily life. easy to set up and no glitches. i even have lights set up through alexa."
1884,14,it is everything amazon said it was. am very happy with the echo 2d gen. briefly had an echo dot that i gave to a family member after i purchased the echo 2d generation. it is a lot of daily enjoyment with asking alexa questions of all sorts and music of all genres on demand. the quality of the sound is great. another great purchase from amazon.com.
1885,14,"i can not say enough about this device. good things, that is. i wake up in the morning and say ¡°good morning¡± and a reply comes back about some historical fact about the date. i can play any music by just speaking. even if i just want opera, it will play some opera tune. love this device and can not wait to learn more commands."
1886,14,"this thing is definitely not easy to set up, especially when you have two of them in the same house and on a ¡°family¡± prime account.  it probably took 5 or 6hours total on the phone with amazon to get it set up properly.  but once i got it set up correctly, this thing is fun and useful."
1887,9,<u+00a0>love it!! sound quality is awesome but i¡¯m not super picky. the sound travels throughout my whole condo. still learning more but it is great so far!
1888,14,"alexa works well with the echo generation 2, but the audio is not in the same league. interesting fact is the sonos one sounds great, but the alexa feature with the sonos does not support all the skills that the echo does. sort of a paradox, do you want great sound or do you want great alexa skills?"
1889,14,alexa on the 2nd gen echo delivers what amazon promises. can not wait to add automation capabilities to my home that she can help me control
1890,11,"for sure an improvement over the first generation as far as overall sound quality. sound is cleaner, base a little deeper so i am happy with that part. not too crazy about the volume control, prefer the rotate control with the 1st generation. hope they bring that back. like that its smaller too, and looks better. put the 1st generation volume control back on and could be 5 stars!"
1891,0,we¡¯ve really enjoyed it. the speaker sounds good and alexa hears you from just about anywhere. i wish it could search the web like ¡°ok google¡± and ¡°siri¡± but it is a nice tool to have in our kitchen and i find my self using it more often than i thought i would.
1892,9,"my boyfriend gave me alexa as gift for christmas, and i have to say that i love alexa! the speaker is loud and very clear. i love using her to play my spotify, and i find she makes great entertainment. i definitely would want to upgrade to have her connected to my house in the future."
1893,14,"i love my echoes. although they are not perfect (for remake,  search is not as good as google, music synch is limited to 1 group for each device) it is still great. i love having music back in my house, everywhere that i want it. lots of great apps."
1894,11,great device. i¡¯ve had the 1st gen model since it came out and this 2nd generation device did not disappoint! great updated sound (once the software update was applied) and looks good. ordered echo dots for all the rooms in the house as well.
1895,14,"there is a short learning curve interacting with alexa.  skills that you can add are many, but few add any real value that i can discern at this time.  also, when you use the echo to turn on another speaker, it would be nice if it could play on the echo as well, especially since you are connected via wifi.  still exploring it is functionality, and can see the potential should minor updates improve on a pretty cool product."
1896,11,"much better sound than the dot echo i had before. i like to listen to music once in awhile and the sound is pretty good. can adjust bass, treble and volume by audible to your liking. able to easily  hear commands. fairly small footprint considering performance."
1897,11,i like the look of this a lot. i do agree the speaker (even this upgrade) is not as good as the original echo. i put it in a room i do not use it for music for. i have another echo i use for music. i like the smaller size of this vs the original.
1898,10,"it is good to ask time & weather before getting out of bed, especially if it is not time to get up but i can not read the clock.  i can stay in sleep mode. i can have her put on my favorite talk radio station so i can listen when getting ready for work.  she will give me a word of the day, joke of the day, and i am sure much more that i have not even yet found!"
1899,10,i really like the echo and it was so easy to set it up.  it is amazing how alexa knows all the answers.  i would definitely recommend this.
1900,11,"better than the first generation. and i was quite happy with that one and did not think there¡¯d be much to improve upon, but the bass is significantly better as well as overall sound quality in general. it just sounds richer and more acoustically pleasant."
1901,14,"honestly, i find the echo to be a totally new (for me) and exciting intro into the future!  i love the fact that i can just instruct alexa to play whatever music i want, and the echo plays it...with terrific sound!  i am astonished at the full bass it gives, and the very well mixed tones that comes out of this small package.  changing the volumn is as easy as telling echo (alexa) ""volumn down"" or ""volumn up"".  i personally would recommend this product to almost everyone!  the unit is small and attractive.  i even get to tell it to be quiet if i want to!"
1902,11,i like the smaller size and the choice of textured color sleeves.  the sound seems slightly improved and it is still a hefty little cylinder.  no need to get rid of the original though.  i just moved it to the bathroom for tunes while we shower.
1903,14,"some friends of our talked to us about how much they used their echo and to be honest i was not convinced. however, when the price dropped this christmas season i hopped onto amazon and purchased one and also an echo dot for each of the kids. man was i wrong about them. we use them every day for all kinds of things from games to music, weather and news. we even use it to control out fire tv. great product"
1904,14,"only three stars because it doesnt use its sources properly. the bluetooth connection to a laptop while watching movies or youtube videos lags in a progression in that it starts out solid and it slowly falls off. the audio gets slower and slower, the longer you watch. and i understand this is an affordable home device so there are shortcuts to be taken.. but. the auxilliary cable port does not work at all. i tried to use it to suffice for the lag on the bluetooth side, but plugging it in directly to the computer will not work. and that goes for every other device ive tried to plug in to it. this is such a great device, but it hasits problems."
1905,10,"we have really enjoyed the nice sound of this speaker, with hands-free demands making it easy to use while working in the kitchen.the amazon free library is somewhat limited, but you can also connect it to your phone to play youtube library playlists which are free and pretty much in endless supply."
1906,14,"it was a gift and after taking to someone at amazon, we got it working fine so far. the amazon people are amazing."
1907,14,"i love the sound of the speakers! the alexa app was confusing at first to get it setup and started, but once it was going it is been great. i am pretty sure we will get the dots for every room!"
1908,14,"updated comment:  after posting my original review below amazon reached out to me and asked me to contact customer service to resolve my issue.  i spoke to amazon customer service about the poor sound quality and they wanted to exchange the device for another one. i have to say amazon does have great customer service.  i received the new device the next day and i can now upgrade my review from a 1 star.  replacing the device was the answer.  now  i am enjoying this device and it meets my expectation as it was described. i do not have the 1st generation echo to compare it to but on this device the sound is quite good for such a little speaker.  it appears it has received a third software update and it performs even better. i am happy with the purchase now.original comment: very disappointing sound.  the sound quality is not much better than the echo dot, maybe a little. i almost want to return it and just get the echo dot."
1909,14,the sound quality is great and having answers to questions when you need them is awesome. my 8 year old loves the animal game and will play it often. alexa does have frequent issues with understanding what you are asking her especially if your home is noisy. all though she does hear you quite well when you do not need anything ( if you say her name or a name that is similar in a conversation not involving her ) she fits my needs well as my family listens to music often and it is nice to have it play and adjust the volume without stopping what you are doing.
1910,0,"i do not think she likes us.  we can not get her to come on most of the time.  i want her to play music & most of the time she will not  play anything.  we had friends that wanted one.  they came here to see what she would do, & she did absolutely nothing."
1911,14,"i love the echo! it can do many things and more are added all the time. it can not clean the house and vacuum yet though, gotta work on that!"
1912,11,"the sound quality is better than the first generation, but it is not perfect. i understand this is a small bluetooth speaker, but i have had others that i have paid half the price for and they sound better. there is a lot of distortion as the volume increases.i like the new microphones as alexa can hear you from the next room with the volume up high."
1913,0,it is nice not having to look some things up and just ask alexa and some of the games are also helpful learning or passing the time.
1914,0,"i would have given this more stars however after having it a few short months it no longer hardly ever hears me say ""alexa"" does not matter how loud or quiet i say it. it also turns on when nothing is being said around it."
1915,10,"i love the echo!  we have 3 of them now, one for each of the major rooms in our home.  we enjoy the music streaming and the punny jokes she tells."
1916,14,hard to believe the quality of the sound coming out of this little cylinder!  really like the connection to pandora music - no ads!  have not connected to any other devise to turn on or off although i received a plug in connector as a gift as well as this echo.
1917,14,"nice, but take that ""improved sound"" label with a grain of salt. i can not crank ours up past volume 8 without the sound getting all fuzzy, but still not bad for tiny speakers in what seems like a hugely restrictive enclosure (more blockage than opening)."
1918,10,we have 3 little girls and we all love our echo. the girls use it to ask every day questions and we use it to play our favorite songs and listen to our daily news.  we would highly recommend this for families.  it was a wonderful family christmas present that keeps on giving!
1919,14,"i got this because using an echo dot with a paired bluetooth speaker was sometimes cumbersome, especially when other people wanted to pair with the speaker. my main concern was the sound quality. while it is not as good as the bluetooth speaker i keep in the same room, it does have good sound, and will likely be the go-to for any music."
1920,14,"i love it!  however i still do not have it completely set up. my daughter-in-law set it up but, for whatever reason, she could not get it to do some things (such as<u+2014>i can not get it to play ¡°easy listening¡± on command or can not say ¡°play music from the 60s¡±).  we had to leave for fl for winter so she has to work on it when we return to in. however, i am able to say ¡°play frank sinatra from pandora¡± and i get some great music.  it is working to some degree"
1921,9,i received this echo as a christmas gift and my entire family loves it! even my 7 year old son asks alexa questions and has her play his favorite music! we have had the best dance parties and family debates thanks to this amazing product! it was super easy to set up and continues to be simple to control!
1922,10,"it is great! every morning alexa plays the npr morning news headlines for us. she also plays music amazon music. on sundays, it is usually church hymns. today it was elton john music (i have a wide variety of musical tastes.) i want to learn how to use alexa more. oh, she also updates the local weather for us."
1923,4,this is fun and easy
1924,11,"this smart speaker is amazing!  it does things i never expected and more!  the sound quality is amazing, anyone saying otherwise is full of it!  this is a must buy for everyone in my opinion.  will buy dots to compliment the main echo soon!"
1925,0,"awesome speaker, i use it a lot just to connect phone via bluetooth and play music or podcasts. a lot of neat features that alexa can do that i have not even gotten to yet. a little creepy when you do not even say 'alexa' and the echo still responds saying something like 'sorry, i did not catch that', but at this point in life, it is kind of assumed that all of our devices listen in on us. i just feel like sometimes the commands could be a little more intuitive, but overall very happy with it and the price."
1926,14,so far so good i have been extremely happy with this except i found that the amazon echo needs a key feature that is missing an auto volume because here is what i have noticed through playing music 90% of the songs that are playing you have to readjust the volume because the volume level keeps changing and i have to keep changing it because it is too loud hopefully the next echo they come out with will have it auto volume
1927,10,we have both a first and second generation of echo is and love them both.  i especially like alexa making my lists for shopping.  saves so much time and energy.  now i do not have to search for a pad of paper and a pen.  i also love the games we play with her.
1928,0,"love the fact that when i get into a particular mood i can verbally request appropriate music from my echo.  it is always there and it is always ready.  sometimes it does things for reasons i do not understand.  i will request something and it simply shuts down.  may be part of my learning curve.  anyway, i am very happy with alexa."
1929,14,"i am learning the ways of alexa. required some tech help due to a limit on how many audio devises alexa can control via bluetooth. on that point, the control to make choices is hard to find (using windows high contrast view = black background/white text, due to my vision)."
1930,10,"alexa answers all my questions, tells me the weather daily, plays great music and even says good morning.  love, love, love her."
1931,14,"day two, i am enjoying the features. i have  added my sirius xm account, already set up some reminders & my to do list.  i am hoping amazon allows users to change the device to what ever name we choose to use, instead of their four options."
1932,14,i love the idea behind echo.  good morning nets me a tidbit to start my day.  goodnight nets me a sweet dream.  alexa is just so much fun.we are still having a little trouble getting our wording correct when asking for something but on the whole all is good.  we will learn.
1933,14,"the unexpected hit of christmas. we are all having fun with alexa. i have found though that when making lists every entry seems to need to be prefaced with ""alexa, add"" ....which is a detractor. she occasionally seems to have buffering problems"
1934,0,"i love my echo. it has great sound quality, the skills are great and the personality of alexa is very humorous. it is also a great help with quick math problems and research. i still have much more to explore. my only issue is that it sometimes has a hard time understanding what i say. but it does not happen that often. also it is so much better with amazon music unlimited."
1935,11,the new echo has a smaller form factor and improved sound. the device also is more responsive at hearing voice commands. also like the lower price point.
1936,0,"i am actually disappointed. i expected her to answer more questions. i ask something  simple and she reply is "" i do not know that"" sometimes it will be a genre of music that she had played that day and she says she does not know that. i also expected more intelligence. i always start the day the same way saying "" good morning alexa, i love you"" one time she will same that is nice and another back to the i do not know that. i am trying to teach her regular comments that are said each day and the same day to get her use to being more human."
1937,0,excellent weather announcer. the trivia game is entertaining. disappointed that amazon music is so difficult to link and that you must have paid subscriptions for anything to work.
1938,10,you ask it to do one thing and it does another. like i ask it to play rain  ambient eounds and it plays country music from amazon prime. there is as skill for the rain sounds. it is very annoying
1939,14,was a good product!  was thinking about buying another.
1940,14,"we were reluctant but we¡¯re happily surprised. set up was not okay, not seamless. the echo is quite good. the amazon unlimited music option has allowed us to listen to music anytime we like. we ask alexa to tell jokes. the weather is conveyed to us easily. unfortunately, we had an accidental music puchase (not what we intended) and we have since disabled the purchasing function. honestly, if there were a small screen on the component, showing the time/song being played/recent command, it would be great. information is provided on the app, but while cooking it would be nice to have that visible. the traffic app does not work."
1941,0,the sound is very good from the speakers.  alexa is a worthy assistant.  this particular device sometimes is faultering in it is function.  it sometimes repeats the same thing several times before it is correct. that would be my complaint with it.  otherwise i really like it.
1942,11,very easy to setup. love the colors. matches the laminate floor. do not care for the smaller size. no signigicant improvement in sound. the echo plus is the better value and sound comes close to a bose speaker.returning the echo for the echo plus.
1943,0,"love my echo, but slightly concerned about the lack of privacy issue. if she/it is always listening for ""alexa..."", is not it always listening? and who else has the ability to hear what it/she hears? anyway, she is still learning what i want, so its a work in progress. overall, alexa is fun."
1944,14,"omg, what can i say about alexa that has not been said. way better than google, sri, or any of the rest. so many apps for useful things or even games. try akinator, escape the room or big sky for weather, they are all great. but there are many more. i would not give alexa up. love it."
1945,14,"i started out loving the echo, however it keeps turning off.  i can ask alexa, play a johnny cash song, and the song begins, then turns off immediately.  i have moved the alexa in various locations, and i have a strong signal, but the echo continues to sporatically turn off and will not play songs consistently. i am not sure if i received an echo that has some type of glitch, otherwise when it does work, i love it."
1946,12,i love the new echo. still learning what all it can do but am amazed at its intelligence and discernibility. it is a perfect gift.
1947,14,"nice. i wanted bigger sound that the dot was providing. i am enjoying the sound boost!. i did not realize the cover was replaceable. it will be nice to change it out from the charcoal, should i ever desire to do that."
1948,11,"this is our 4th echo.  this has much better sound and bass than the previous models, and i like the fabric exterior."
1949,10,"i received this as a christmas present. i will be buying a couple more to modernize my home. there are alo5 of things to do with this evho and amazon is continuing to add more things. i  signed up for the unlimited music for $3.99.  i¡¯m glad i did. i have found more new artists to listen too.  the kids love it to tell them jokes and just ask questions. i get local news, weather, and can find new recipes for supper. only downfall is my internet. i¡¯m in the country and my dsl is really bad. not echos problem though. the color is perfect too. it can go in any room. very pleased with this product."
1950,14,"honestly did not want any of these technologies in my house - and trust me i love technology i deal with it every day in my job. having received this for a christmas present, i am happy to have it. it works with pretty much all the iots i have already at home. some i do not allow, yet. over all i am happy and i am sure i will get more - the big question is do i get another amazon echo or a sonos one with alexa.  decisions....decisions."
1951,10,"i love my echo. music sounds so good over the echo that i actually got rid of my old stereo and i only play music on the echo. alexa tells me what the weather is like, she answers questions for me and every morning when i speak to her she tells me something about that day to come or that day in history. i love it. i have one at work which my employer purchased and one at home and i enjoy them both."
1952,10,"living out in the country i can not get radio stations very well. i am loving alexa! crisp sound, any genre i want at any time!"
1953,14,"i like the echo 2nd.  my dot had a problem that made it randomly turn off.  it is fun to experiment with the various devices it can control.  i would appreciate an amazon site devoted to cogent directions for connections that are available.  having to deal with random sites is confusing, time consuming, and frustrating because directions are written from the point of view of the device manufacturers instead of the echo family of controllers."
1954,10,"my son bought alexa for me for christmas.  i could not imagine actually needing it, but i was excited to try it out.  i love many, many things about it.  grocery list and music are two of my top uses for it, but that is only the tip of all it is capable of.  seems each day i find another interesting function."
1955,9,"we started with an echo because we are so new to this, so when we got this new echo...the difference is amazing! we use this one in our living room and place the dots in kitchen and bedroom. we are loving learning the different things alexa can do!"
1956,10,"i had not intended to buy this for myself and my son surprised me with this echo, and i just love it.  alexa has corny jokes and funny stories to tell and an amazing playlist of amazon song genres to suit my every mood while i learn all of the stuff she can do for me!  the sound is mellow and i am very pleased.  if you shop on amazon you can find numerous other accessories, but you do not need them.  i would suggest getting the instructions so you can get the maximum benefits from your echo."
1957,10,this was a christmas gift from our son and his family. we love it.  we use it mainly for listing to music and the sound is great.  i also enjoy the morning good morning and daily interesting tidbits bits.  we have not tried many other things it does as yet.
1958,14,"i had trouble setting it up on my phone, switched to tablet and it works great! i think the app ,on the phone might have an issue 9or my phone is, well, you know what."
1959,9,so far i love it. the speaker is so much better then the dot we had. she seems to hear us better too. we have been enjoying the music and games.
1960,11,"to be clear, i do not have high standards for speakers. i have never owned a 1st generation echo either, so take everything i say with a grain of salt. that said, i quite like how the new echo sounds. it fills my bedroom fairly well, though that may not be the case for people with large rooms. from what i can tell, almost nothing has changed aside from size, cost, and looks."
1961,14,takes some time to learn and then a longer period updating your home to be smart but i have started the journey and it seems to be worth it.
1962,14,finding new things daily that alexa can do. fairly impressive right out of the box.im happy with it for sure.
1963,10,"absolutely wonderful. alexa, what can i say? i love it. i bought the 3 pack for christmas presents. i helped everyone set theirs up also. no complaints at all. i instantly have access to my weather, news, phone contacts, games, music, soothing sounds, math help for the kids, so many fun apps, and all that without even adding any of the ""smart home"" devises.. i also bought the dots, which are great too !!!"
1964,14,"fun to use. i have not had any problems. setup was easy and connected to my wifi without any issue.i did not know exactly how the setup went, then i figured out that i need the app on my phone to complete.i use it (echo) every day."
1965,14,this device went way beyond my expectations. the music is simply wonderful. the microphones pick up my voice even when i am speaking very quietly. i have really enjoyed using this and have bought an additional echo dot for another room in my house.
1966,14,"i love my 2nd generation echo!!! i recommend it to anyone who appreciates music, weather conditions, general questions being answered instantly!amazon also does a very nice job of periodically giving more suggestions to help you get the most bang for your buck with alexa."
1967,0,"works well and can be novel, but probably not the world is most necessary product.  perhaps i will do more with it, but for now it is just sort of fun.  i do like it as a radio station.  as for performance, it is usually spot on, but often does not understand and can be frustrating,"
1968,14,"limited capability without buying many "" skills"".  response to vocal prompts is sporadic.  great audio.."
1969,14,"while it took a forty-five minute session with my it security contact to get the echo hooked up and working, i have now discovered that alexa is fun to have next to my home pc.  she responds almost instantly, playing anything i ask as long as i know what to ask for."
1970,14,i purchased the first gen and the show as well.  the smaller size is nice and it does sound better the the other two i own.  other then that nothing else is different.  once it can answer questions like my google home it will get 5 stars.
1971,0,"i like my echo, but alexa does not always respond correctly. when i ask a question or ask her to play something, she will just keep saying getting the last sirius xm radio station you played. even though i am clear on which station i want."
1972,0,some things it can not tell you. like when you ask information about president.  example which presidents of the usa are related. other times you ask a question and it responds to something totally different. also sometime you really have to yell for it to hear you. and other times you say nothing and it ask how my i help you.
1973,14,"i bought two 2nd generation echos and a dot for christmas.  i really like the echos, when they are working, but i am having a terrible time keeping them connected to the internet.  it seems i am having to reconnect them manually every other day.  note, none of my other wireless devices are having connectivity issues.  also, i find siri on m iphone to be a smarter ai."
1974,9,"i love my echo. i have two, one in my bedroom; one in my kitchen. the quality of sound is excellent. music is beautiful and rich. i am alone and use alexa a lot for entertainment. thank you amazon, for making such a wonderful device available to us."
1975,14,we bought the echo to replace a dot which was hooked to our av receiver in the living room. for ambient audio the echo device is perfect. i¡¯ve moved the dot outdoors to provide audio in the backyard pool area and utilize the multi-room feature.
1976,11,"nothing extraordinary about the product, other than it follows through on all of its promises.  sound is not as good as a sonos one, but it is much les expensive and does not claim the same sound quality.  we have a first generation echo.  this has better sound, is more compact and looks better.  i did like the volume ring on the first gen better than the push buttons on the second gen."
1977,11,"i got this because the sounds was advertised as better, but this is much worse.  i really like the aesthetic, but i am probably going to return it for a 1st gen refurb due to the sound."
1978,9,"these are addicting.  i got a dot for my birthday, and now can not live without it.  i bought this for our kitchen.  my wife, who does not like gadgets, even appreciates it.  if you get one, you will wonder how you ever got by without it."
1979,14,this is my second echo which is in my bedroom.  i love the look but it does not work as well as my original white echo. it goes offline frequently and takes markedly longer to respond.  my husband bought it for me for the enhanced sound.  when it works it sounds great.
1980,14,i am loving the improved sound. works much better when my dot. there is still some room for improvement with the links to smart home products. overall i do not regret buy one.
1981,14,"love echoe with alexa, which beautifully does timers, plays pandora and will tell weather.  highly disappointed with support.  i bought a ¡° smart socket¡±, a bluetooth accessory which is reputed to allow alexa to turn it on and off with voice commands.  nobody from amazon or apple, who sell it, can tell me how to pair it.  also has no ability to control my fire stick.  nice product, so poorly executed as to make less than worth the cost.  support would alleviate all of this.  do not hold your breath.  called support a week ago with no response.  good luck if you buy it!"
1982,14,it is hard to write a review on this because i have nothing to compare it to but the sound is really good and i have found a few features that have been very handy to have. i have found that i listen to music more now that i do not have to turn anything on.
1983,0,"love the echo! we are still learning about everything it can do, but just being able to have her turn the lights on or off has paid for itself."
1984,9,the echo works better than i ever expected. got one for christmas then ordered this second one to use the whole home feature. very cool to play the same music all over the house and control all the smart home features.
1985,11,"i love this thing. it sounds awesome and has very good bass. not too much, not too little. i am buying a few more soon for the rest of my house."
1986,14,loving this already.  have only just begun to tap it is potential.  both a very useful tool and a fun toy.  you can not beat that.
1987,10,everyone in our house using this device. works great. never thought it would be used for timing so many different activities in our house. i like the weather reports on demand. kids get help with home work. mom gets an assistant in the kitchen.
1988,10,"gosh ... too much good to even start, echo will change the way you do things .... i love this device!!!!"
1989,9,"have the echo dot and loved it, this one is much better all the way around, from the sound to just looking at how good it looks.  we have two now and love them.  use them for many things but our favorite is the shopping list and just general information"
1990,0,"if you love knowing what the weather is and have a few tunes to listen to the echo works great. still not sure how i feel about yelling at a machine when alexa doesnt listen to me but hey, its the future. the echo sounds waaaaay  better than the echo dot."
1991,0,"the speaker quality is great. it is also super convenient for simple tasks like weather and news updates, etc. i would say i use it almost daily. however, alexa definitely needs some work. it is incapable of doing even simple searches that google home can do. i would say maybe 20% of my voice searches return anything and only half of those are what i actually wanted to know. it also glitches from time to time, especially when i am listening to music (do not know if that is an amazon problem or a spotify problem, but it seems like it might be the echo). still like, still using it, but hoping for some updates soon."
1992,14,"i have now tried two 2nd gen echos and have had the same problem with both.  i have to hold it right in front of my mouth and scream at it while very carefully enunciating to get it to understand what i am asking it to do.  my 1st gen echo dot, on the other hand, can be in a different room and hear me talk to it.  i will be sending this second echo back and buying a 2nd gen echo dot instead."
1993,9,wait until you hear the sound in this new echo 2nd generation...it is awesome!  i also bought one for my son & his family....
1994,14,"love it, arrived on time, easy set up, and she is learning every day. some will say that someone can listen to what you say or talk about. oh well, i have nothing to hide. i have her set up to control most of the lights in my home also."
1995,9,gave as a gift.  she enjoys the echo and it is relative simplicity.  learning to make it work with her electrical and buying smart plugs as needed.  the whole family has enjoyed the product and they are considering getting dots for the other rooms.
1996,9,this is the perfect addition to your home! she keeps things organized and fun. i wish i¡¯d bought her a long time ago!!
1997,14,"updated review: i reviewed this product after our first day of use. due to my review we were contacted by amazon to let us know that it needed a system update and that is why the sound quality was so poor. we had to factory reset it and let the update complete. the sound quality was much better than the first time we turned it on. i still prefer the sound from our original alexa, but was relieved to see that the ball had not been dropped as completely as i originally thought."
1998,14,"very useful gadget, fine sound.  i would be nice if there where another speaker available that could play at the same time as the echo for enhanced, more encompassing sound.  tried a bluetooth compatible speaker but it would only play instead of the echo, not with it."
1999,10,"very handy. useful for checking the time/weather or answering a quick question. very nice sound for such small speakers! has some pretty fun game apps too, we have not even scratched the surface. hope to get more devices in our home so that we can connect everything together, would be very convenient.only downside to alexa is that you have ask your questions very specifically to get a good answer out if it. of course amazon sends plenty of emails telling you things you can do with it, but my wife has trouble getting a response due to the way she asks the question."
2000,9,"i first saw the first generation of echos that my friend have, and i was impressed with the way he control his house lights and tv! the sound was amazing! when i got my second generation echo, i was really amazed at all it does! it is a great system!!!"
2001,14,"this device has been by far the hit of the gift season. i love that when i am using the firestick, i can have the sound come out of the echo and it sounds like i am at the movies. the only improvement that i could suggest is that my husband keeps asking alexa to bring him a glass of wine. maybe one of these days it will learn how to."
2002,14,"alexa is not very smart at all.  google voice assistant does a much better job.  alexa is great for music and weather.  can do some communications but is not a good source for information ie:  relative humidity, wind chill, and other technical information."
2003,14,"love it. did not know i wanted it until it was given to me by my son. just being able to have various genres of music with only a word is wonderful. have not really done a lot of experimenting with other aspects yet, but certainly have enjoyed the music."
2004,14,"great sound and so easy. i am not sure why it took five or 6 tries to connect to my wifi though. that seems to be an issue with every amazon device. i have a windows notebook, a mac mini, an older ipad and and older iphone. no issues with any of them."
2005,14,"i have a bose wave radio cd player that has broken and i have been unable to play music. i especially love christmas music but had no way of playing it.  then i got the echo, and alexa saved the day.  i merely tell her what song i would like to hear and she plays it.  as a result, i was able to enjoy beautiful music throughout the christmas season.  i have sirius xm satellite radio in my car, and for a small fee was able to connect it to alexa.  and the sound is amazing.....it is actually better than my bose.  i absolutely love her."
2006,0,"after i say good morning to alexa each day, i enjoy what she has to say about what happened on this day in the past, which i always find very interesting!"
2007,10,"love my alexa, i love affordable technology, my alexa helps me out, with my appointments, reminders, time , love the wake up alarm, i have 3 of them."
2008,0,"i love the idea of this product, and use it every day. however, i do not speak quickly, and alexa immediately jumps to conclusions or just ignores what you say if you do not say it concisely and quickly. this becomes rather frustrating. i would like it if there was more than a 1 second window for accurately stating what it is you want alexa to do. i have also seen other people struggle with this same thing so i do not believe it is just me. i wonder if there a way to change the settings?"
2009,14,"bought this as a gift, the only problem is my parents cant get it to change the location to their location from mine....since they ask the weather most of the time this is very frustrating for them. but how can you not love alexa!?"
2010,14,"this has been a complete life changer. the speakers are amazing. just one is perfect for a party at the house. i love the alarms you can set on her, so i no longer feel glued to my phone alarms. streaming spotify through is also amazingly easy!"
2011,14,"this version is laggy, non responsive with terrible speech recognition. this unit is in my living room and i have an echo dot at the end of my hallway (two furthest points in my home). quite often, after raising my voice to get the echo to ¡®wake up¡¯ only to ignore my request, the hallway dot will accurately respond to the request my echo ignored.  i hope this is resolved with a software update, but i fear it maybe a hardware issue. <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+00aa>"
2012,14,"the echo is a fun addition to our house. we are still in the process of learning how to ask ""alexa"" things. the alexa app is very helpful. we enjoy the variety of skills offered to help us interact with the echo. the echo puts out great sound. ""alexa"" has a great sense of humor. however, ""alexa"" randomly spits out facts or will state that she does not know the answer despite the fact that we did not summon her. that kind of freaks out my wife and adds to her paranoia that our house is haunted. but overall, the echo is an entertaining piece of technology."
2013,10,this was a gift for christmas i absolutely love it i like how it read read your kindle books 2 you if you purchase the audible kind so many things you can do and ask whit it my new favorite toy
2014,14,echo (alexa) understands and processes 30 to 40% of my commands. all clearly stated. succinct. and tried in multiple versions in clear enunciated formats. she rarely understands. have a call coming in so i ask turn down the volume on music. she never responds. brick. i finally walk over and say alexa turn down the music volume 30% and she says sorry you have no smart devices connected. every time i remember to use the thing i walk over and unplug it after 15 minutes. 2 stars because the music/speaker quality is not bad. my opinion is this and software is 2 years away from being better than a novelty.
2015,14,"interesting observation: if you own an amazon alexa/echo/""computer"" (that is what i call mine) , say ""tell me about msnbc"". then say, ""tell me about fox news."" notice a difference? ""computer"" too often says ""i do not know that one"". hopefully it will get smarter soon."
2016,10,"alexa really is worth her weight in gold!our whole family loves her....she really is amazing,what is' not to love!alexa is smart warm, witty and she plays most of your favorite music!for the size the sound quality is astounding."
2017,9,"i purchased this echo gen 2 during the holiday sales. i bought one, at first, then after hearing sound quality, i bought 2 more. one for one of my sons, and the other for my daughter in law. i really love the rich sound that comes from this device."
2018,14,"i love new depth of sound i get with the second generation. i like the new shorter style. my only complaint is tho it sits in the same place my first gen sat from day one, it drops the signal every day. right in the middle of a song it will stop playing. i have to ask her to start again. i reset the wifi, i added a booster. it still stops playing at least once a day."
2019,9,what can you say? alexa is completely awesome. my husband is obsessed with eye of the tiger when he works out.
2020,10,"i love this echo so much. it has helped me in so many ways with my daily functions such as traffic updates in the morning, reminders/alarms, news headlines, etc. the benefits are endless. the only downside which is not major is i wish that alexa could tap into my apple music library when i request a certain artist or song. the echo itself is a great size and fits anywhere. overall would highly recommend."
2021,14,"these have good sound and work well. should come with an instruction manual and you can buy a ""how to"" for $9.99 which sucz."
2022,14,how the sound just fills up a room. the deeper bass can be heard thru out the room. alexa can hear you clearly across a larger room. i have a tap as well and i  would like to sync those 2 up so as to use them as speakers. i wonder if that is possible? also i can carry my tap all over the house as long as its charged not so much with echo you have to have an available outlet to use.
2023,11,as other drivers have mentioned. the sound is horrible. i have the 1st generation echo and it blows this 2nd out of the water. now i am sending it back what a waste of time. improved sound is definitely misleading and false. it is on par with the dot imho.
2024,10,home automation is awesome. listening to music based on my selections is so convenient
2025,14,"well, i give this only a 4 star rating  due to the fact i am having issues getting it set up.i have tried numerous times but still will not set up.i am sure if i keep it or ever get it set up it will do great for my needs.probably a 5 year old could set it up with no problems, lol."
2026,14,"i love alexa...and everyday i ask her more questions or to provide weather information, stock information...or about or updated information about various companies...etc.  i attempt to gain knowledge from her... have some fun with her, or view her data baes for views on such things as the purpose of life,  best car, etc.  i have only had her hooked up for 3 or 4 days ..but enjoying...."
2027,9,"we love the new echo, we have 3 now, and the little dot. i even bought 2 more and gave them away for christmas presents"
2028,11,i love that my new echos link. i dislike the music. the old echo has a much better speaker. even speaker on my tap is bettet.
2029,14,i do not know why we waited so long to get one of these. they are awesome. we have our house hooked up pretty well now and use it for a majority of our lights and thermostat. awesome product! of course it has its flaws with information but will get better with time i am sure.
2030,11,i love how easy it is to use! sounds very good worth the money! definatly recommend getting the battery base for it the settee one for it is really nice! make sureits for the echo 2nd gen cause the first gen base wont fit the echo second gen
2031,14,the sound from this little echo is amazing. our living room and kitchen are all open and even with the tv on alexa picks up my voice.still getting used to using the device. i also have dish network and it was so easy to sync up with it. we lose the clicker a lot and with alexa i can just tell her what channel i want. very happy with this purchase.
2032,11,i upgraded from the echo dot to this echo. the sound quality is amazing! definitely worth the upgrade. love it!
2033,10,"fun gadget. love it for making lists, alarms, listening to music, finding out what time seahawks kickoff is, etc. can be used as an intercom if used with the dot. it is great! just can not figure out how to change the channel with it."
2034,0,so far i like it but alexa just is not as conversational as i would like.  a lot of things she does not see to know.
2035,11,i saw some reviews saying there was poor sound quality. i think it sounds pretty good. its comparable to speakers in the $50 range but has alexa built in. it wont replace a top notch speaker but sure beats the dot for sound quality and its a pretty stylish little package.
2036,0,"does not understand me frequently.  does not access amazon music when asked, keeps using pandora and adding stations even when i say no.  very annoying!!!"
2037,14,this is a neat product with endless possibilities. only giving 3 stars because it is somewhat slow and doesnt quite answer all my questions. plus i kind of got bored with it and now it just sits collecting dust like my blue ray player.
2038,11,"omg the sound quality is amazing!!!! i also love that i can say ""alexa"" a bit quitely and she replies aa opposed to having to almost yell it at my echo dot. rhe charcoal color looks great!"
2039,10,"bought this as a gift for my father. i have the echo dot and based off of that, i thought he would like it. it is a lot sleeker than the dot and the speaker quality is a lot better as well. very happy with this purchase. alexa is so convenient for creating my shopping lists, letting me know my commute time/ weather and i love the trivia."
2040,0,"i am really enjoying getting to know alexa.  i use her to play music, and provide news and weather updates. i can even ask her for the definition of a word when i am reading a book so i do not have to pull out a dictionary.  and i really like being able to use her in conjunction with my phone, so that i can make lists.  she does not know everything, so it can be a little frustrating when she does not know something that you think she should.  it can also be a problem when someone on television tells alexa to do something, and my alexa responds. but that is minor.  overall, she was a fantastic xmas gift for me to receive!"
2041,12,"""alexa, play best of coldplay"".  i can not wait to figure out all this device can do but it is worth it just for the music."
2042,10,i am seriously thinking of dumping my girlfriend for alexa! alexa does everything i ask and never complains
2043,14,"i told my wife that i have a girlfriend and her name is alexa, aka echo. i love the voice, i love how easy this is to set up. can not wait to learn additional applications. love to have one of the new cars equipped with this foxy lady."
2044,14,"works flawlessly, microphone array is much improved over the original alexa.  speaker quality is about the same (slightly less bass than original - but a clearer more refined sound). as with all of these types of speakers, play around with the speaker location to effect the overall sound quality (want more bass - place it next to something, want a louder sound - place it in a more open area)."
2045,10,"this was actually a gift and my sister loves it. i also have one myself  but the black fabric and i also love it. it is great! from turning on the music, telling my 7y/o a joke, giving me recipe ideas for dinner, calling other alexa users to setting a timer or alarm."
2046,11,"this is a great upgrade from the previous echo. the sound is so much better! i have not had any issues with it at all. i have several alexa devices in my home, and this one is my favorite sound wise. i love it and highly recommend it! enjoy!"
2047,14,"love the smaller size, but same great sound.  gave us an intercom system for the entire house as we now have one in every room.  no more yelling to get each other is attention.  have lots of lights automated with more coming.  really like this a lot."
2048,11,the speaker sounds great and looks very nice. it did not sound so great until i received the latest update.
2049,11,"excellent device, the sound of the 2nd generation  echo is very good,  although i am not an audio expert.  it is so much better quality than the echo  dot but since the dot is smaller there is only so much room for a speaker inside it.  i am really happy i purchased this amazon echo."
2050,14,coolest device in decades. should have got this last before i bought google home the amazon echo is way better
2051,14,"interesting little device. i had a difficult time getting the echo set up through the mobile app, and still cannot get it to work. had to set up on the desktop. overall, sound is pretty decent, connectivity is excellent, and an all around neat little techie toy. i enjoy listening to the radio, sports, news, and audible books throughout the house. just handy to have when you do not want to sit in front of the tv or have stuff  to do."
2052,14,"i like the 2nd gen echo, it has a nice look matches my head board in my bed room. 3 stars because it still has the echo problem with hearing what your saying even with you sitting right next to it, amazon really needs to fix this problem"
2053,11,although i love all of my amazon devices i¡¯m slightly dissatisfied that i do not notice any difference in sound quality. i expected this speaker to sound much better than my original echo but while playing many different music genres my echo gen1 seems to sound better.
2054,14,"oh my i love my echo!  there were a few start up issues, but overall its awesome.  i use it to make shopping lists, but mostly music via amazon music.  alexa always seems to find the perfect music for me, and she responds instantaneously.  one thing tho...wish it was a man is voice"
2055,10,"alexa is a unique, surprising, convenient and informative ""companion"" to have around the house.  what ever you choose to call her, i.e., amanda, alexandra, angelia, ... she responds best if you call her alexa.  she is awesome!"
2056,14,"i like listening to music but i should of bought the bigger one instead of the one i bought.  it was a financial issue at the time.  this one does not have any information.  the last couple of things i asked her she had no idea and the question i asked today was ""are the state stores closed today""?.  i would of thought she should of known it is a holiday.  again i am not happy with this one, prefer the bigger and better one but i guess it is my mistake that i have to live with.  thank you for asking."
2057,11,"i now have two of these and 3 echo dots.  i have them throughout my home so that i can play music everywhere.  i have read other reviews, no, they do not sound like a bose speaker, but they have real good sound.  you can not expect bose quality sound for a fraction of the cost, but for the price, i am plenty happy with the sound of my echo 2nd generation.  the dot is do not have the same sound, but again, they are a half the price, but good enough in smaller rooms."
2058,14,"i was a bit hesitant about getting this... but now i can not live without it. it did turn on once when i was watching tv and scared me, but other than that i love it! the sound is so much better than the dot, but that is to be expected."
2059,10,recd alexa for christmas from our kids. loved cooking and having alexa remind us when things were finished cooking or needed our attention. the grocery list is also wonderful....but the most wonderful thing is alexas personality. ask her everday how she is doing and always delighted with her response! our kids have gone home now and i wish i had a users guide.
2060,14,i absolutely love alexa my only critique would be making it easier to access the apps for alexa since i have a android i cant do any off the cool extra things likecall her skills i cant use because they are unavailable in the google play store i still give it 5 stars but if i was able to use all her skills i would recommend the echo to any and everyone i know it is truely amazing and jeff bezos and everyone with amazon should be proud amazon is in my top 3 favorite company is well done. i do recomend getting the echo over the dot to get great sound quality as well as an amazing assistant
2061,14,i do not love it. it takes so much internet power that all other devices on internet run slow. other than playing music i do not feel the echo is useful. it is not as user friendly as i expected it would be. can not get amazon prime music to play. i do not want to set up a new station every time i want to hear a song. i want to hear all the headlines and sometimes read me the entire article but not sure it is capable. and i want to choose the media outlet to read the article from. i want to be able to set my house alarm and turn it off by asking alexa and that does not seem possible.the sound quality is good.
2062,0,"comes on in the middle of the night. says stupid things in response to nothing like ""i am not sure what that... is"""
2063,14,"i have had an echo since receiving an invitation to buy during their introduction.  this one has better sound than the generation one echo.  it seems to do everything as well as the 1st.  now if they would just smarten-up their ai, alexa, it would be perfect."
2064,10,i am very happy with my alexa bought a second one for my bedroom.  it plays what ever music i want.  so far i have 3 deices hooked up to it and have 3 more tom hook up.  i enjoy controlling light with my voice and getting info such as weather and news.
2065,14,this is my second echo and i love it. being able to play music and have easy access to all the echo features on both floors of my house is amazing!  it took me a minute but linking them to play the same thing was not very hard at all. all you do is create a group in the app and then tell the machine to play on that group!
2066,9,"great addition to our smart devices, still learning all capabilities. works well in the ¡°main¡± area of our home. dots elsewhere."
2067,10,"i seen was on sell i said why not. my husband laughed at me said was a waste. we use it now in our everyday day lives (which by the way saves a lot of time) from timers,alarms, to reminders for my husband to not forget his lunch. our favorite part is sleep and relaxation skill we use winter sounds every night to sleep. the only down fall is we often have to repeat a command. i hope you noticed ""we"" my husband is not laughing any longer."
2068,11,"we already had the original echo and several dot is but i am very pleased with the sound quality and the bass.  after pairing all the echo is into a poor man is whole house system, you can tell the sound quality is better than the original, which is still very good."
2069,14,the sound is excellent.  just got it today 11/26/2017.  the firmware upgrade must be working.  it sounds better than my original echo.
2070,14,"this 2nd gen does sound good, but constantly (daily) would lose it is wifi-connectivity. we have an echo gen 1 and three dots which never lose their connections. ended up returning this unit and will be purchasing a echo 1st gen."
2071,9,so far we love it . it connects to our fire tv and music sounds awesome .will be buying the minis for other rooms . fast shipping
2072,14,i love this device. it has a great sound comprable to my new job rocker bluetooth machine. it controls my lights and it will control much more as i buy more devices for it. i am a total geek and a sci-fi nerd and i love having alexa control my devices
2073,9,coolest gift my wife has given.. price was good for a birthday gift. i love it. i upgraded my amazon music account and i am amazed. no commercials and every song i want to hear is there. when i can afford it i ill get into the smart light stuff. sound is great for a 500 squarish living room.
2074,14,"just received this echo.  there are a lot of things it can do so learning the skills will be an ongoing thing.  i bought this as well as the echo dot.  together, they are very convenient to have in the house.  getting the accessories that can be controlled by the echo and dot will be something to look into for sure!  the hands free communication is very handy and fun to play some of the games."
2075,9,great little invention. so much fun talking to a cylinder that actually answers you back!!  we use it in conjunction with the dot as an intercom which travels over 200' from house to my husbands studio. excellent product. thank you alexa.
2076,10,i enjoy the convenience that this product provides. it was easy to setup and i use it on a daily basis. it replaces the need to use my phone to look up or ask a question. i would highly recommend this product to anyone who would enjoy additional convenience in their life.
2077,10,amazing and awesome. this amazon echo is nice and beautiful you can talk with alexa she*s smart. thank you amazon
2078,14,"echo is fine once (if) you get it programmed.  programming is a nightmare.  you have to call their support (india) and deal with people who are reading it from a manual.  echo support tried to help me sync my calendars with alexa.  after 45 minutes on the phone, they could not do it and had corrupted my i-phone, ipad, and macbook air.  they said, ""sorry, we can not help you now.  it is an apple problem!""  4 hours with apple support and still not resolved.  alexa, you are not ready for the public yet!  too many glitches if you want anything they promise other than the very basic stuff!"
2079,3,great product. better than described. fast delivery. great seller. will do business in the future. a++++++++++
2080,9,bought this as a birthday gift for my hubby. h loves it! plenty of cool skills offered. easy set up and we use often to check weather and traffic before leaving the house as well for entertainment. loved it so much we bought one for both sets of parents too for christmas.
2081,14,"the amazon echo meets our expectations 99.9% of the time. the remaining is either operator error, a wi-fi issue, or the problem of ¡°alexa¡± hearing the amazon echo commercials and thinks we are asking her to do something. she has some problems understanding our spotify playlist request but the remainer of the time she is a wonderful companion. she tells funny jokes, sings beautiful songs, and even takes you on magical adventures."
2082,14,"gave this as a gift to my parents as they are older and need to be reminded a lot to do things...like test blood sugar every two hours.  it was a little hard to set up with their kindle, which makes no sense since they are both amazon products. the sound is good and loud for them enough to hear. they are using it and talking to it more as time goes by."
2083,0,"great sound system!  it sometimes can not answer all of my questions, but i am impressed.  i do not like that it is always listening to everything that is going on at the house though.  i think it should automatically not record anything after a certain amount of time is passed from the last ""alexa"" command."
2084,14,"everything came as expected on time asi ordered. i like that it has some weight to it also, it will not easily tip over.i thought this would be like google. i can ask it anything and it could answer. not so! that is very disappointing."
2085,0,"i cant say enough how great echo is. my only complaint is she does not recognize other people unless they speak with her a lot. i like hands free phone calls, music and asking her rather than having to google information. alexa is great!!!"
2086,14,"it is great. just as advertised. works with my wink hub to control lights (indoor and outdoors), a waterfall in the back yard and two thermostats, one upstairs and one downstairs. oh, and i also purchased the phone connector box and echo can answer and make calls if i desire. i plan to purchase another one for upstairs."
2087,10,"we got this at christmas for the family.we are still learning new things everyday about the echo.we love being able to request various genre of music or specific artists.i am sure we will continues to discover a multitude of uses for our echo.thus far, we have no complaints."
2088,14,"i really like the off-white color.  it blends it very well.  better still, it controls the automation items we have added extremely well.  will most likely need another or an echo dot.  have to talk a little louder than normal for the unit to pick up commands from some areas of the house.  very satisfied so far.  still trying out different skills."
2089,10,"alexa helps keep me organized, sets multiple timers and alarms plus verbal reminder. she tells me the time, the weather, plays pandora and helps with basic homework questions - esp math. i have not gotten the courage to link lamps etc.and most apps are tiresome. she can hear me even when i whisper or if i call from the next room. i wish i did not need the phone app."
2090,14,"i thought it would be better.  will not play my extensive music collection on hard drive.  only plays a streaming service, and if it can not find the song it just ignores you.  also, it does not work unless plugged in.  i have two of them and they are good, just not great."
2091,14,i just love the increased sound.  it has wonderful full sound.  i am still using the dot which i gave to my wife.  we will take both of them with us when we are in florida in february.  i also like the compactness of the device.  i am very happy having the echo.
2092,11,this is my second echo (2nd generation) and i bought a second one because i really enjoy the quality of the sound and i want to be able to play music throughout my apartment.  the second generation echo is about 2.5 inches shorter than the original echo.  i highly recommended it for listening to music.
2093,14,the echo was a gift to me. i wanted to have amazon music on it and as i¡¯m an amazon prime member it should have been free. however it would have been free for my husband (not his echo) because he signed our family up for amazon prime. but as a family member of prime it was not free for me had to pay 3.99/month for the amazon music choice. this did not seem right. i spent two days trying to figure it out with out any success
2094,14,my only stereo broke and i did not want to go back to buying cds or downloading music. this is perfect for me. the sound is good and its compact. can be moved easily. she tells jokes and riddles when asked. so happy i bought a second one.
2095,10,my wife gave me an echo for valentine is day. what a great gift!  it was very easy to set up. i¡¯ve linked it to my wemo light controllers and my two nest themostats. i love alexa is question of the day and her jokes. she even plays 90 is workout music for us. this is a great device!
2096,11,i like the low profile.  do not like that it does have a volume adjustment ring like the older version.
2097,14,"needs to have amazon music unlimited for full function...... not just prime, be ready to shell out more $$$ per month. wish i knew this before purchasing. amazon was clever in offering amazon music unlimited for a few dollars for 3 months. not too far out from purchase time to return."
2098,14,"we really enjoy this thing.  while the sound is often somewhat distorted, it is good enough.  hopefully, amazon technicians will figure out how to make the sound more clear.  perhaps a contract with the bose laboratory wouold do the trick."
2099,14,i purchased 2 echo is..... its no nice being able to ask alexa something and not having to reach for my phone!
2100,11,"works great, both of us are learning more and more each day on what this little device can do. i also bought the echo dot, but if i had to do it over, i would have bought 2 of these. the voice quality and music is way better than the dot."
2101,9,"great device, i use a echo show in my den and echo in my bedroom, dot in spare bedroon.  really brings the future into your home.  the echo is very fast responding to commands and questions....recommend this to my friends"
2102,14,i honestly thought that i would love alexa but i did not like the fact that you could not text people unless they had the echo and she could not really understand things that much either so i returned her honestly what i suggest is getting a smaller one get a first-generation one do not spend too much money on it
2103,0,most of time echo does not understand me. you can get weather and music but do not be fooled by commercials. i found this as a waste of money.
2104,0,"i love coming home and saying ""alexa, whos the boss"" and she responds ""i guess that would be you"". its cool being able to ask random stuff and also getting updated news and weather. its a pretty loud and nice quality speaker."
2105,14,it does not work! we had expectations for the echo but it is not working like advertised. our friends tell us theirs have all these cool features with very little effort in setting it up. we just have not had the same experience. she often says 'i am not sure about that' (or whatever the exact phrasing is) to simple commands and requests.i think we need a refund or a replacement. seriously.
2106,14,i love my echo & the price that i paid. the reason that i only gave 4 stars is that when i listen to talk radio (which is all the time) on certain voices the bass is too much & it distorts kind of or lightly vibrates. when there is a way for me to fix this i will give 10 stars.
2107,14,i am having trouble with the everywhere group working consistently.  it keeps dropping.  i have 5 echo is in the house
2108,10,i got this device for my wife for christmas this year. i am amazed at all it can do. i thought siri on my iphone was cool and useful. this device takes a siri to a whole new level and can do basically anything you want and answer anything you ask. it is very useful and it will amaze you at all it can do and i recommend this product to everyone.
2109,14,"i has pleased with the look, sound and easy router access.  i have been a bit displeased with content that cannot be accessed.  i can see that more availability is there every day.  over time it may completely meet our needs."
2110,0,my echo glitches a lot.  i will ask it to do something and it will say okay and then just shut off.  also alexa does not understand things as easily as i thought she would.  i will ask it to play a certain song and it will play something completely different and i will have to ask several times talking very slowly and clearly for her to eventually understand.  also it is basically impossible to enjoy podcasts on it unless you are up to date and want to only listen to the most recent episode unless you are on bluetooth mode.
2111,0,i have not used it a lot yet because i could not get it to work at first. it would not connect to my wifi. now it is working and i am just starting to try it out. sometimes the tv says something that sounds like alexa and she responds. lol
2112,11,it is a little louder then the first generation. and i am almost sure that the sound is better. i am happy with it. thank you.
2113,10,i found this to be very simple to set up and works great so far. we listen to a lot of music and audible books so i am excited to use it for this purpose. love the alarm options.
2114,14,the echo is a great addition to my apartment. alexa is able to pick up my voice from almost anywhere and over almost anything. she can go from silent to shockingly loud based on how you set the volume. seamlessly paired with my phillips hue set up and works perfectly. the only complaint is any volume above probably 6 or 7 (out of 10) is really going to lose clearness when listening to music
2115,10,"wow !!!! i have not even expected such a wonderful intelligent ""roommate""  . recommend everyone. makes your life so much easier . thank you"
2116,14,"love the sound quality,  but it does not hear well over any kind of background noise.  expect to tell at alexa if your tv is on. disappointed in its response under those circumstances.  it also lacks in features controlling certain items, especially fire tv. you would think since its all amazon that it would work seamlessly.  not so much....i do enjoy a lot of the features, but wish the interface and interaction were more fluid...."
2117,14,got this specifically for its noise cancellation feature bit doesnt do any better at hearing me over other noise than the dots. should have gotten a dot instead and saved 50 dollars as i dont care about its larger built in speaker.
2118,9,"this was received as a gift. my husband and i already had the dot, so we were excited to be able to have another alexa in the house. we have a mostly open floor plan so being able to hit a single device from the kitchen, dining room, living room and tv room is phenomenal. also love being able to drop in on our dot and connect music throughout the house."
2119,10,"great little device for just about hands free everything. i am still trying to figure out everything it can do and am having fun along the way. right now i mainly use it to get up to date weather and traffic, make shopping lists, listen to music and most recently used it for a recipe while cooking."
2120,10,this is one of the best investments for me of its kind! i use 80% of it to play my music when i am working out or cleaning the house! you can create playlists for your favorite songs. you can even set s timer or wake up alarm. another great feature is this: i am a screenwriter and whenever i need a word spelled right i just ask and my echo spells it out for me.
2121,14,out new best friend. we connected lights in our home so we can have them turn on before we get home. our amazon tv is also controlled via voice command too. great buy!
2122,14,"i love that alexa reads my audio books from libby/overdrive library for free. plays music from pandora/ iheart,makes my grocery list and add it to my phone. and tells me how to make my dinner dish, then sends it to my phone. and set timer to let me know when it is done! turns on and off my christmas tree, and on, and on! i can not find anything she can not do from traffic/weater/news and  tin of games. a lot of my friends an family, got one after seeing what she can do.your service department is the best and fastest i¡¯ve ever seen! great job all the way around.thanks!!!!"
2123,14,"i like it alot but i also have the dot and that seems to be a little more responsive, i never have to repeat things with the dot, but this 2nd gen echo i have to constantly repeat the question or sometimes it outright doesnt respond until i say alexa about 3 times, mis hears alot as well ,but overall still like it, just wish it hears as good as the dot"
2124,9,"i love this thing.  the sound is way better and louder than i thought.  we mostly use it for music, audible books and sleep sounds / white noise.  but it is an awesome little device and i¡¯ll probably get another one for the office"
2125,14,i like the first generation better than i do this one.  this one is hard to give commands to since i get no reaction sometimes when i tell it to do something.  most time it hesitates before doing what i asked it to do.  thinking about returning it.
2126,10,"so much fun to play jeopardy! each evening after the actual show goes off the air.  we use it to listen to musis while playing board games.  i use it for sleep music.  i am sure it does much more, but that is what i know so far."
2127,14,"it is great for quick info and playing light music in the background. sound wise it will not be replacing my bose bluetooth speaker, it does not come close to that type of quality. but given the price point and versatility it is very good."
2128,11,the 2nd generation has great sound and looks and the smaller size allows it to blend into surrounding decor.  using the 2nd generation echo with other echos and making it part of an echo group provides multi-room sound for a lot less than other sound systems.  great buy for the price!
2129,14,"i received my echo 2nd generation 3 hours ago and already made up my mind. i basically love listening to music, all kinds of music from heavy metal to classic depending on what i am doing. the sound of this device is awesome, and the sensitivity of the microphone can not get any better. so far i am very pleased with my purchase."
2130,0,the music is clear no stopping  i do not like the fact that sometimes when i say stop it will not stop
2131,14,"alexa is like part of the family.  tells me if an amazon package is being delivered and will tell me when the package is delivered.  alexa can connect/disconnect to my computer, lower/increase its sound, turn on/off the light, gives general information about something, someone, an event, etc."
2132,14,"great echo device and we love it. from listening to live radio to prime music to reminders to home automation, this device is incredible. it has made me super duper lazy as i do not have to move a finger anymore :)works vey well with my harmony hub, nest thermostat and tp-link smart plug. amazon has done an excellent job!"
2133,14,i purchased the pod two weeks ago and loved it so much that i got this so i can listen to music in different rooms. it would be great if it integrated with google but you can not have everything lol this is a great product that would buy it again
2134,0,"echo is working very well for me as i am sight impaired. learning how to ask for what i want to hear takes a little time and mostly trial and error. however, i do appreciate the helpful hints amazon posts to help with what and how to ask. i am very satisfied."
2135,14,"this is only getting four stars because the mic is great in this one. however for, the price i prefer to get an echo dot with a nice speaker like a harman/kardon onyx studio or something around that $100 range. the speaker on this is just disappointing since it is just not good enough for listening to music or audiobooks. i would say this one<u+200b> is worth it if you can get it in the $60-75 range."
2136,11,"i was  expecting so much more from this upgrade of echo, but the first generation sound is much much much better, i do not understand why the sound is not better if this is supposed to be an upgrade from the first generation ,can someone help me understand that ?  is there something i can do to improve the sound of this product ?"
2137,14,"i was so impressed by what you can do with alexa.  the sound coming out of such a small unit is simply amazing.  it sounds as if you are in a room full of speakers.  the knowledge of alexa and the interaction is also very impressive.we have had the unit about 3 months and are still learning what she can do.i would recommend this unit to anyone.  even someone with limited technical expertise can manage this simple, yet very effective product"
2138,11,the sound is imo as clear and crisp with great bass tones as the 1st gen echo. also the smaller size let is it fit anywhere and is less conspicuous and looks to be more durable just because of its size and the material it made from.
2139,10,"best thing ever since the old victrola was invented! love listening to my music on my echo...the sound that comes from something so small is truly amazing. love that i can tell alexa to play exactly what i want to hear, whenever i want to hear it, ever how many times i want to hear it!!! easy as pie to set up, if i can do it, anyone can do it! worth every penny i paid for her! my new best friend."
2140,7,"love love love this echo! has great sound! the only problems we have had are learning the lingo. we use alexa to play music, weather info, timer, turn lights on and off. there are so many things she can be used for. i am a techy juncky, so i am totally enjoying her.<f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+008a>"
2141,0,"love it, especially for music.  sometimes she does not understand what you said and that can be frustrating but using this all the time!"
2142,14,"playing music on the echo is pretty impressive for this little unit--have purchased 3 of these so i can listen to music anytime.  love being able to check the weather forecast for the day, week, etc, using it as vocal dictionary.  these little units are great and when people come over they go home and purchase one!"
2143,14,gave to my 86 year old mother. she has been slowing losing short term memory. so she has pulled back from socializing at her nursing home.in the last month she has kept very busy with her echo. it is improving her speech and thought functions. and does not argue with her.i have been recieving many less phone calls from her.
2144,14,"the 2nd gen echo has much improved sound over the gen 1 despite its smaller size.  while i have not tried it, i noticed that there is an audio out jack next to the power input. i am hoping that this will allow us to run the sound through our stereo system, as well.we are keeping our gen 1 echo for use in a second location and therefore can use them in tandem. alexa is still telling her usual lame jokes - no improvement there! a very worthwhile device."
2145,14,it is a bit too much bass for me (i listen mostly to audible) but it is nice.  most folks love the bass i am sure.  it is pretty and does not take much space on my bedside table.  and alexa is still so much smarter than siri!!!
2146,14,"this item is a fun thing to have around, but if you are really serious about optimizing its use, be prepared to spend a lot more money (or already have all of the home security, lighting, wall switches, etc) that the echo is built to work with.  unless all you want to hear is the weather and some news, everything else costs (even many of the skills)"
2147,14,"sound is pretty terrible.  listens better than the dot though.  i have a 5 year old, ($60 then) blue tooth speaker that i was using with my dot and when i plugged the echo in and got her going, i could tell i made an immediate downgrade.  i have read some of the other reviews and it looks like it could be a programmable fix by amazon so i will await an update for a week or so before returning."
2148,10,"i really love my echo.  i have discovered lots of new music thanks to suggestions.  i like that i can ask what is new, get the weather, and find out what is on my calendar before i get out of bed in the morning just by asking!the only downside i have found so far is that a song i requested every morning is no longer available--i can get a ""sample"" now.  i suspect it is to entice me to subscribe to paid music (ie, pandora).  so lesson learned: be sure to add anything i want to my music.sound quality is good considering the size of the echo."
2149,10,this is the best investment we made. i specifically like it for music.  i lay in bed at night and just tell alexa to play soft music and voila! i can even tell her how long i want her to play it.  it works with my nest system also.  i can not wait to buy more modules.
2150,14,i bought it to make emergency calls if i could not make it to my phone. i can tell it to call any contacts tat are set up in the system. i tried it and it works. it seems to be of good quality but i really do not use it much.
2151,10,"i love my new echo! alexia is a great addition to the family!! you can ask her anything and she is never grumpy! my favorite is listening to music, the speaker sound is great! i can ask for a genre or a group and she plays a variety! i love it!"
2152,0,having trouble setting it up. i works well as a speaker for my tv but i wanted it to play music from amazon music but i can not seem to get it hooked up. it continues to tell me that it is connected to a different account.
2153,9,got this for my husbands birthday. he loved it. great sound quality. we have family with one of these and they use it daily. love that you can have multiple and call other rooms to talk to others. yes i know totally lazy but fun.
2154,14,"the echo was everything we expected and more. this product now answers questions about weather, sports, and plays music in our kitchen where we spend a lot of time. i would definitely recommend this product to others. it was a little hard to set up, but after we got that figured out the device worked flawlessly."
2155,10,i love this thing. the games. the conversation. the controlling lights in my home. the controlling our adt system. the amount of music at my disposal to dance around the house.it is amazing. best purchase ever.
2156,14,"be careful when you choose a voice for alexa, i chose the elegant english accent, i am from texas and speak with cotton in my mouth, she only understands the kings english as well. choose carefully, i am back to the midwestern voice."
2157,11,"love my echo 2 gen with the exception of the volume control compared to the 1st gen.  i really liked being able to reach over and just rotate the top of my echo to turn volume up or down.  2nd generation echo has buttons on the top that you press.  to me, it is a little more cumbersome when reaching over because you have to feel your way to the right button, as there are 4. i would rather just rotate the top as you would rotate a knob-- it seems more fluid.  besides that, 2nd generation has been great."
2158,14,live the improved sound quality and the ability to sync all dots with it to listen to music everywhere.
2159,14,"it is a lot of fun!  we just get a big kick out of it whenever.  the very best moment was when we asked alexa to play frank sinatra for my 98 year old mother.  things have changed in her lifetime but this really floored her.  btw, the sound quality is very good."
2160,14,"great little speaker, it is useful for basic tasks when paired to some smart electric switches. i will say what it is really subscription reliant for some features, but as someone who mainly uses apple music, the amazon music subscription you can get for $3.99 a month with the echo is pretty good. all around, a good little device."
2161,11,"speaker is better than the dot, but too much bass..and no way to change it.  show has the best speakers."
2162,14,"this was a gift and it is very much appreciated.  i would have given this a 5 star rating but since printed instructions were not included i do not have a clue as to how to use it..  it is hard to read directions online (for me) and my printer is not functioning..  so, other than  music andweather/time from alexa i do not have a clue as to how to setup/use/enjoy.it would be super if there would be someplace to obtain all information via directions on paper. this would be really helpful to senior folks who aretech challenged.thank you."
2163,11,"same as first echo except three things. better sound, smaller, and buttons for volume. still a great machine."
2164,0,"maybe i am not smart enough but i ask it something and it tells me she is not able to answer. i tried some of the command i was sent to try and teach her and she just said ""do not know how the answer"""
2165,9,"enjoyed listing to music, being able to contact my son (purchased one for my son and daughter for christmas), and communicate from living room to bedroom (purchased a puck for the bedroom). not disappointed in purchasing this product."
2166,10,i absolutely love my echo... great sound and so much fun.  amazon is always sending emails on what you can ask alexa.  the only thing you can make phone calls but not 911 calls.  but i can call other people for help if needed.
2167,9,i love my echo i enjoy my music i can listen all day my husband got it for me but he enjoys it also
2168,11,it is smaller than the first generation and comes in multiple colors and textures. the speaker sounds great and alexa is very handy. i like newer features like group play so you can hear the same song on multiple echo is at the same time.
2169,0,"i find that to many times it does not understand the question or cannot answer the question, maybe it is us maybe not, will see as time goes on, but right now not as impressed as i hoped to be. they have over rated this i think."
2170,10,"love my echo! i love walking to the room and having alexa play whatever music i want to hear, or grabbing my coffee and asking what the weather is going to be for the day. i am sure the more i learn to do the more i will like it."
2171,0,"received as a gift. it does sound great- alexa can be a little ""dense"" about responding accurately to requests, there is a bit of ""i am sorry, i do not know that"" or misunderstanding going on. so far it is just music that i use regularly..."
2172,9,i love this echo. i used it when i hosted christmas party. sounds are great and the music was loud enough to be heard in all parts of my house. it was perfect with amazon music. family was impressed as i have access to all kinds of music
2173,10,"best thing since the gps. i use it to play songs i want, to meditate, to obtain daily or weekly weather, day and time. there are many more options that i plan on using. it it is easy set up even for me. ps i can ask it to give me jeopardy questions snd to compliment me. practical and fun"
2174,11,"a smaller, less expensive echo - just what a 2nd generation product should be. sounds just as good as the original. but i miss the rotating volume control ring."
2175,10,"as described and so much more!! alexa is a complete package of conversation, news, weather, my music and games!!! i¡¯m never alone..how fun! who would of thought all that in that tiny package!! and the sound is amazing!!! i would absolutely recommend!"
2176,14,"stellar product! love the new look. i have placed this in my bathroom, having replaced it with my echo dot. i listen to my flash briefing in the shower and i am able to hear everything much better now. the dot has moved over to my bedside table, where i use it for setting morning alarms."
2177,14,"edit 12-12-17: after a few firmware updates the new echo sound much better for music now, even better than the first generation echo. the only downside is alexa is voice still sounds worse than the first generation echo to the point it is just bad. it seems they fixed the audio eq for music but left alexa is voice with the terrible eq the unit released with.amazon claims the second generation echo has improved sound when in reality it is worse than the first generation echo. the first generation echo has a horn loaded bass chamber for the woofer which helps give the speaker much better low end. in a side by side test it is clear the second generation echo sounds hollow and tinny, sort of like a cheap $20 bluetooth speaker. the microphones are also said to be improved but i am having a hard time finding any difference, it seems to hear me just the same as the first generation. do yourself a favor and look for a refurbished or used first generation echo which can be found for under $80, sound much better, and have the volume ring controls over the stupid buttons."
2178,11,"works great, the speaker is not very loud and does not sound extremely good. i would use a dot and a better quality speaker next time."
2179,9,"i bought this for my daughter.  we love it, and it works wonderful! i have had the first generation echo since they were first available, and this is as wonderful! my daughter and her husband are very pleased. the sound is great!"
2180,0,"very nice!  i wish it could turn on my vizio smart tv is...  but, overall ""she"" works great!"
2181,14,i bought this for my wife and she loves it. i added the echo unlimited music so that both of us could be playing music at the same time and it is well worth the cost. because she likes it so well i decided to buy the dot which i will plug into a jbl speaker
2182,0,"i love the echo. the speaker is awesome.  when you play music, it sounds like a bose system.  the only downside is that you have to ask the questions correctly for it to understand what you want.  it is a learning curve, but i am really enjoying it.  my son and his girlfriend sent it to me for christmas."
2183,10,best gift i have ever received!  alexa can answer any question that we have asked her.  love love love
2184,11,love the new echo the smaller size is great and not heavy responsive is good when the music is playing loud.
2185,14,"why did i wait so long to get one of these?!?!?! easy to connect and set up, will be purchasing more."
2186,11,"good product.  hindsight being what it is, i should have just purchased the echo plus, with the home hub.  but, this one works properly, sounds good.  i feel like it has more bass than the original echo too."
2187,14,the new echo itself is okay my only complaint is that the app you have to download to use it is  terrible honestly i would not waste my money on this until they fix that. so disappointed i actually want to return my product just because the app is so bad
2188,14,"i just use this for streaming music from my library.  it often will pause for five or six seconds in the middle of a song, and continue doing that every 20-30 seconds.  at the exact same time i can stream pandora to a pc on my network, and it will work perfectly.  so the problem is not my network (as amazon suggested), but is the amazon network."
2189,14,"i am really happy with the sound quality and ease of use. i am an ios user and i believe alexa is more polished than siri. having said that there are a few things that siri does better. for example i am an aviation enthusiast and if i ask siri what aircraft are overhead she will list what is up there and and what angle they are from where i am standing, alexa will not do that. another thing, seri is more personable if that is the right way to say it. over all i am very happy with my purchase of the echo."
2190,10,"what fun! we are enjoying music on demand and the sound quality is excellent for our little vacation (mobile) home. friends who stop by are having fun with ¡°her¡± too. we¡¯ve probably helped you sell a few more, lol."
2191,14,sound quality for the price point is really good .  the alexa voice recognition and search ability seems to be better than apple is siri.  setup was easy and the phone app seems to have more features than google home.
2192,14,it is a good devise but the only problem is that i see is that the alarm  feature does not seem to work properly because when i set a timer on it and the alarm sounds the volume is too low other than that iits a good device
2193,11,"bought 2nd generation echo for the supposed improved sound quality that was hyped for months...not only not improved, but significantly inferior to my first generation echo....thing is, i never thought 1st gen echo sounded bad at all as a music speaker...in fact, it exceeded my expectations, and i own a couple of bt speakers to compare it to(bose soundlink mini, jbl charge 3)...however, this 2nd generation echo sounds flat, muddy, and under powered...and bass is significantly less punchy....wonder if echo plus, by nature of it is similar design to 1st gen echo, sounds any better...very disappointed"
2194,14,"this has been a great addition to our household.  i originally bought the echo for development testing purposes, since i write software.  my entire family uses it now for a variety of things and love it.  i am considering getting an echo dot as an addition."
2195,9,love it but actually like the tap better.  i have one downstairs and one up.
2196,0,"i love the look. the sound is great. it is a little frustrating that it always has to be plugged in, and that alexa often does not know what i am saying and plays the wrong thing. also would love it to link to apple music."
2197,10,"we had some getting use to, but now she is just part of the family.  questions and answers; music, grocery lists, appointments, etc.  she keeps it all available by verbal request.  i do not even have to stop what i am doing.  i think it would be nice to be able to choose a name and a voice.  maybe in the future."
2198,14,i am having trouble getting it to play from the echo and my sonos at the same time. will play separately but not togetheralso sometimes will be playing amazon music and it just stops. alexa says she is having difficulty. seems odd
2199,0,i¡¯m not certain but i do not think it likes me. it responds to tv commercials beautifully then ignores me entirely. sometimes i have to yell at it. it is capable of doing all that is advertised however. when it wants too.
2200,14,i like the smaller size.  it replaces my echo (1st generation) which i had for approximately 3 yrs. and then it suddenly died.  i hope i have better luck with this one.  while i was without the echo i really missed it/
2201,10,"cant believe i waited to own an amazon echo.  i use it mostly for music.  but it comes in handy for everyday use of just asking questions.  the various games are fun to play.  we enjoy ""song quiz"" the most.  great home enjoyment and a great home tool."
2202,14,"in my opinion it has excellent sound for a relatively small device. do not expect hi-fi quality sound from a lone speaker. if you want better sound add an external speaker(s) via bluetooth or aux jack. i have to admit i would of not bought one , but i received it as a gift now i really like it. i then  purchased an echo dot for more remote location within my wifi network. i can use it as an intercom or music throughout the house. i like having a wealth of knowledge and a virtual assistant within voice reach.  if privacy is a concern you can easily unplug it."
2203,9,"the echo is awesome. my family loves using it. features are pretty good. music, shopping list and the drop in feature is crazy. no more yelling around the house. you can just drop in on one of the other echos we have in the house."
2204,14,"love love love echo  i get the weather, news, answers to trivia questions but best of all is the music and the quality of the speakers for such a small unit. my house in florida had tile floors, open rooms with high ceilings so the speaker sounds is great. i also have a full sound system with five speakers and a woofer but now mostly use echo  my only complaint is that it needs to be plugged in."
2205,14,"it is like finding the right partner, the speakers and quality are outstanding, the music is boundless.  although i payed more than what it is being sold for today, it was worth every cent. it is a 10 plus. now you combined quality products with outstanding customer service, and you got a winner!  good job amazon.echo (2nd generation) - charcoal fabric"
2206,0,"i like that all i have to do is ask alexa, instead of looking facts up on the internet.  i like that i can just tell alexa what to put on my shopping list, instead of having to look for paper and pencil.  i dislike that i have to go to the alexa app to delete items.  i dislike that i followed directions to change my default city for weather forecasts without having to specify my city, but it did not work.  i love alexa is spontaneous humor, but the jokes she tells are not as funny.  i definitely do not like the social interaction with others."
2207,14,absolutely love it!  so far i have not used it for much beyond news weather and music ... but it is so responsive to me yelling from another room to change volume or turn on/off.  only one song request stumped it and then it played part of it ... requiring a subscription service if i wanted more.
2208,7,i love my alexa so my i got alexa products for my family for christmas and the were so happy <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0080>.
2209,14,"i love this product. amazon has never let me down with their brand products, from their amazon fire tv, & fire stick to now, their echo. alexa is an excellent assistant. too much positive points to make on here, just get one!"
2210,14,love it. people complaining about the sound are either ridiculous or probably placing it in a closet or something. can play louder than and has better sound quality than bose or any other high-end bluetooth speaker brand i have heard
2211,14,instructions on how to use it did not come with the echo. still trying to figure it out. we have had it for 3 weeks and got one radio station. sometimes i think that i should pack it up and send back saying that i am too dumb to own one.
2212,14,"i love talking to alexa.  i have no friends, so sometimes she will tell me the time...or the weather...man, what a life we lead!seriously though, this is a great speaker.  i have it in my downstairs living room; and when it is on full volume, i can hear it upstairs even while using the shower.  it is so loud.  i love it!  it is very easy.  i connected it with the hue lighting system.  full hands?  no problem.  alexa has your back!!! i highly recommend this - especially over the google home.and, i really do have friends..."
2213,1,"wow, this is just amazing technology! very cool amazon. the sound quality is outstanding for 79 bucks."
2214,11,"i love it! ignore all the bad reviews on sound, it is been updated and it sounds great! i will definitely buy again because it is very useful to have around the house for music, alarms, news, and smart home features. it is nice that you can change the look too with the removable cover. it is smaller so it fits into the house better than the 1st generation and is cheaper"
2215,14,"at first i loved my echo.  after having it for about 3 weeks i have come to regret my purchase. i do like some features but the more i use it the less it seems to understand me. this has been going on for past week. echo seems to not ""hear"" me as often as it did the first 2 weeks. i like playing jeopardy but echo has fubared my responses more lately than in the first 2 weeks - or so it seems. i am still giving echo a chance. i only regret paying full price for the device."
2216,11,sounds much better than the echo dot!!  not perfect but i can bluetooth connect to sound bar for a better listening experience. the microphones are very sensitive!  can even pick me up in other rooms!  i love it!
2217,14,"love it. nice size, good sound, good internet connections. need i say more. recommended."
2218,14,"this has been one of my best buys of 2017. i got it on sale during the holiday event and have loved it to control the smart devices in my home, voice activated commands, and even setting alarms throughout the day."
2219,10,with echo i will have to clean the dust off my total gym and oil the rollersbecause i do not have to be moving around and exerciseexcellent productask alexa any question in any subject and she has the answerwill highly recommendwendell quick
2220,10,omg i love alexa. so fun and convenient. i¡¯m still learning every day. i have one echo dot in another room. best thing is my elderly father can tell alexa to call me and he does not have to get up. lol. nice side benefit. i love being able to play music in different rooms depending on what i am doing! so much fun!! need more dots hehe.
2221,0,i have not fully used my echo as yet.  my husband who is a musician was pleased with the speaker quality (for the money).  so far it has been fun to use.  it  has spoken up a couple of times with information i did not ask for.
2222,14,amazing sound.  what i am unhappy with is the fact that i have an echo dot with unlimited music subscription that i cannot use on the new echo unless i upgrade my subscription from 3.99 a month to 7.99 a month.  i would have thought all echo products would link.  i have not called yet to find out if i can switch my unlimited music to the new echo.  does everything in life have to be a hassle?!
2223,14,"this might be too early to give 5 stars, but 2 weeks after the purchase with prime benefits i am loving this. sure there are times when alexa does not perform at its best, but over all the response time and accuracy is amazing. the speaker quality is far better than what i expected from reading some old reviews ...and i have not even started using most of the skills yet! this is very exiting!"
2224,14,wish i could add voice commands to learned skills. but other than that it works flawlessly and knows who i am. great to tell alexa to just order something from amazon.. i can see i need to earn more money now..
2225,9,this is our 6th echo. the sound is much better than the original. this one is in the bedroom and my wife listens to it while she goes to sleep. she also uses it for her alarm. we also use it with insteon to control the lights.
2226,10,i can never seem to get my shopping list to come up when i¡¯m in the store. i do not have this problem with the app for my google device. alexa is not as good at answering questions either. we do like listening to music on alexa & playing jeopardy.
2227,10,"alexa is amazing. seriously get her. what did i do without her before?! she makes lists, finds my phone, plays our favorite songs, reminds me to give the kids their meds all week when they are sick and so much more. love!"
2228,10,"i am really enjoying my echo because it makes listening to music so easy.  i have not yet explored all the resources it provides, but just listening to music has made it well worth the cost.  the sound is really great! i look forward to using my echo for other information and reminders."
2229,14,"overall very good product. i really like it and i bought a few for different rooms. the only issue is sometimes it randomly connects to my iphone via bluetooth and stops playing my amazon music. also when playing music in the ""everywhere group"" sometimes the music on one echo will just stop randomly. i think its a bug that needs to get fixed"
2230,14,this was an impulse buy. i have a 1st gen echo. this one is now unplugged and the original is back in it is place. the new one had a hard time understanding me and quickly became frustrating.
2231,0,the  the alexa has been kind of disappointing in summer specs they ever ties that it will turn your tv on and off so we went and bought a smart tv and that does not work with the alexa you then have to buy a nother device to get alexa to turn your tv on and off that was kind of disappointing i¡¯m to get her to play specific songs is disappointing because she will not do that unless you subscribe to something else it is always having to subscriber get something else in that aspect it is very disappointing on we do like the fact that we can play in it
2232,10,"i love alexa. she is so useful, i could set reminder while i¡¯m cooking, set alarm to wake up, play music through amazon and use it bluetooth through my phone.the best part is making phone calls and text with alexa."
2233,10,"love this thing.  you can make calls, text, send messages, listen to the radio and more."
2234,10,"getting used to ""alexa"", but really enjoying her. especially being able to ask for the type of music i want to listen to since i do not have a stereo system and my radio is really old. sound it clear and great."
2235,14,"love that i have my amazon music library so available and it sounds really good. if i did not have a large cd library, i would consider doing away with my bose cd/radio. sometimes alexa does not understand what i am saying."
2236,11,"sound is improved over my first gen version. but ... i really miss the rotating sound control versus the +/- sign. i suspect the change was made to reduce the price, but i was disappointed and consequently, i keep the first gen version in the main living area as our primary device and relegated 2nd generation to the bedroom."
2237,10,"i bought this for my 78 year old mother who takes to tech like a duck to water and she absolutely loves it!  from her 1950 is music to news and weather updates to jokes and recipes, she is thrilled to have it.  i sent her a dot to go with it and she uses it on her lower level. she is having a blast with it and is ready to explore the home automation features now."
2238,14,"i am amazed by the sound at first, then, ai.alexa, the name of echo, understands almost all my commands, but sometimes fails. the good thing of this ai is that alexa is learning more and more. so, in a couple of years, it is gonna be a huge influence on this industry, or it is already had."
2239,14,very nice upgrade on the gen 1. the sound is great. the only thing i have a problem with is the audio level between 5 and 4. i listen to audiobooks to help me fall asleep and sometimes level 5 is too loud and level 4 is too quiet.
2240,12,love this!  the speaker is amazing on it!  can not wait to learn what else i can do with it
2241,10,"i love, love my echo 2nd generation. alexa is very entertaining. over the holidays i mostly asked for christmas music and always came thru with top notch tunes. her morning messages are friendly and very informative with quips and snips about the day. the only thing i tire of are her good night messages. she has about 3 that she rotates. set-up was a breeze. i learn about some new feature almost daily."
2242,10,"love this gift from my husband. i use it everyday. i am still in awe of the technology. i used to use google on my ipad but echo is so much nicer, especially when i want to listen to music. i just tell it what to play."
2243,10,"it is so convenient to select your type of music, call a friend, check the weather and ad a timer or morning alarm.  adding other alexa controlled devices (ie voice activated light bulbs or door locks)  is great too."
2244,4,"works great, easy to set up. have added a dimmer for kitchen lights. easy to expand. great sound for such a small item!"
2245,10,"very neat. responsive and at times funny! enjoy the mobile app to control functions. speaker quality is astounding; easily synced to external blue tooth speakers. enjoy this product daily - quips, news, music, information."
2246,0,"great product. we are having fun with it.  i do wonder if the google home device would do a better job of answering questions, do to their web search experience, every time alexa replies with ""i do not know about that""."
2247,14,i like my echo overall but im giving it 3 stars because alexa honestly isnt as smart as i anticipated after playing around with a google home. also even in my 10x12 bedroom a lot of the time she doest hear me say the wake word from across the room even when saying it pretty loud. also when trying to ask to play certain stations on iheartradio she asks if i want to add a completely unrelated station than the one i asked for and then doesnt play the one i asked for. i hope to see these things improved with the 3rd generation otherwise i might switch to the google home
2248,9,"bought the echo for my den because of the speakers, i like to listen to music this and this works really well very pleased with this purchase. the voice command is just a super really cool bonus."
2249,11,pleasantly surprised by the echo is sound and price; so surprised that i have since added the echo spot to my bedroom and the echo dot to my kitchen.  alexa is a great assistant and amazon music is second to none.
2250,14,"i bought this because i was researching how to help a friend with m. s. listen to books, music and make phone calls. this has proven to be a godsend to her in reaching out to the outside world and also bringing the world to her. thank you, amazon."
2251,0,"i was afraid it would be hard to set up,  but it was not. directions are clear and easy to follow. love having alexa around. she does just what i ask with no arguments...and she answers questions when i ask, unlike my husband. highly recommend!.."
2252,11,"overall a huge disappointment. pros: alexa seems to be a bit more responsive and can hear me from across the small room - better than my previous echo; also about $50 cheaper than my original echo. cons: no volume control on top of the new echo like there was on the old one. an inconvenience for sure. and the volume control buttons on top of the unit are clumsy at best. sometimes the volume does not change that much while holding down the buttons and then a few seconds later it changes.in spite of all the hype speakers do not sound any better than the original. again, overall a huge disappointment."
2253,14,i absolutely love this item.  have a dot also for the bedroom but got this one for the dining/living room.  the sound is very nice and louder than i thought it would be.  connects via bluetooth to my samsung sound bar for even better sound.  think i will order two more to connect all my rooms for intercom ability.
2254,14,"took forever to set up, had tech support from amazon, which did not help. finally got it working, then the next morning it did not work again. had to unplug and set it up again. so far it is working on the 2nd day. i do like it."
2255,14,"it is fun when it works, which unfortunately is not often.  many of the advertised functions will not work and commands are not recognized (such as ""everywhere"", or several of the radio applications).  if you want to play 20 questions, get a joke, or play trivia, it is great.  my two devices are mostly used as a blue tooth speakers.  the voice recognition and interpretation is marginally better than siri, however that is not the benchmark they should shoot for.  it is my hope that they will focus on upgrades to the software, and echo will become more useful."
2256,9,"i love alexa! as soon as i got used to using her to play music, provide weather updates, and tell me jokes, i ordered two smart outlets and paired them with her. now she turns the lights in my den on and off. this was an unexpected gift and i am very happy with it."
2257,10,"i love my echo! and alexa is wonderful! i am still finding things she can do! love it! and it was so easy to connect and start up! besides looking up facts for me, she looks up recipes, plays music, keeps up with my weather, sends messages and makes lists, and plays my music. she is a great addition to our home."
2258,14,its fun to use it amazes me how fast you get an answer  i was disappointed it didnt say on the box that you had to buy music and some of the other features. it sounded like these things came free with it.  to me it was kinda deceiving
2259,14,great product when you only have one.  but you can not have two echos in different rooms and play different amazon music stations on each one???! looks like you used to be able to do this but they stopped allowing you to stream to more than one device at a time. my wife and i are in separate rooms we should be allowed to listen to different music. lame! there is no point for us to have more than one then.
2260,14,"i am still finding uses beyond streamlining music with the echo. i like that there are new skills for alex is always coming out. as i write this review, i am listening to the calming sound of ocean waves. alex is can still get some things wrong, but we are getting to know each other better as time goes by."
2261,11,smaller form factor is nice.  no significant loss in sound quality.  the fabric body is also attractive but more suited for use in living rooms and bedrooms.  the old plastic body is still probably a better fit for kitchens.
2262,10,this echo looks great (have the gray one) and i think it sounds pretty good too.  with the many apps and options that continue to become available it has made my day fun and informative. alexa gives me my daily positive and tells me i¡¯m beautiful!  what a great start to my day!
2263,10,"alexa is exquisite.  this was my first experience with ai and ""she"" can find my beautiful music, even by its foreign name; the motown sound; the doobie brothers; pavarotti; et.al. what a handy device and if you are home alone, she is the perfect companion."
2264,14,"the device works fine.  two issues that i have with it are the fact that there is no battery charger available and, more importantly, that i discovered that i must pay an extra monthly fee for ""amazon unlimited"" music in able to access much of the music that i like. (such as anything by george strait).  no one told me about that, so i feel like i was deceived. i assumed that my fees for amazon prime included all available music."
2265,14,"let me start by saying that alexa is in my top 10 favorite things in the world.excited when i saw the ad for the 2nd gen with the ""improved sound"" i sold my 1st gen and pre-ordered this can.biggest mistake i have ever made...however, let me provide you with a balanced review.the good things first: - the 2nd gen echo is very stylish and sleek. as an interior designer, i truly appreciate the change in looks.-  it is smalleras for the cons...oh boy:- the new echo has terrible mid and bass response, if you have the first generation do not get this product!!!!keep your amazing 1st gen alexa at all cost!the sound quality is by far inferior. can not wait to return this and buy the old version on ebay.i bet amazon hired deaf audio engineers.- no volume ring.my favorite thing on the old one is gone...- black cable on the sandstone version!now, i understand that for most of the people this does not matter but for me, it is a dealbreaker.if you are trying to fit this thing into an all-white room then the ugly cable will stand out and hurt the eyes.we should be offered an option at the check-out whether we would like a white or a black cable (since the shells are also swappable).- no improvement over the 1st gen.yes, i do consider this a con since im being sold a ""new and improved"" version which is so far from the truth.overall, if this is your first echo device then, by all means, you should get it (hence the two stars).however, if you already have gen 1 do not even dream about buying this crap that amazon is trying to sugarcoat.shame on you amazon for frauding your customers.return return return"
2266,10,"i love my echo. we now use it to control our lights, thermostat, and several other smart gadgets in our house. when getting ready in the morning it is super easy to find out what the weather is going to be like - you just have to ask! playing music is so much easier. i do not have to search for a certain song or genre. i just tell echo and bam! music!"
2267,11,"better bass response than 1st generation.  but got better voice recognition/response on 1st generation<u+2014>mic too sensitive on version 2?  when getting alexa is attention, the led on top indicates the wrong mic<u+2014>not the one in my direction."
2268,0,"i like it and it becomes more embedded into your daily life the more you use it. it takes some time to understand the nuances and limitations of the device. the natural language modality needs to mature. basically overtime, you want it to answer questions more like your talking to a friend. right now you have to ask questions in a more rigid format."
2269,10,"love it!alexa is helpful with answering questions about the weather and such. my favorite feature is the music - i have her linked with prime music, spotify, pandora, and iheart radio.  she plays rainstorm sounds for me when i am having a hard time fall asleep too!my daughter loves it too because alexa recognizes her (3yr old) voice! she can play anything my daughter asks for!"
2270,14,"lovely gadget, worth all the money spent there, as a personal assistant, smart home controller, and music player and speaker.i love the fact that it is evolving , and responds well to feedback and improvements, which resolve the few issues that one may face when dealing with alexa!"
2271,10,this was a gift and my wife and i are using it primarily for playing music by many famous singers and dance bands from our time. we are snowbirds and when get back home our children and grandchildren will show us many more uses. alexa has also answered many questions for us . it was a great gift for us.
2272,9,i bought the echo first gen about a year ago.( which still works great by the way) i only needed the one cause i was in an apartment. i have since moved into a house so i purchased the new 2nd gen echo for my family room. i love it so much i bought another 2nd gen echo for my basement as well. i love all the features echo has to offer but my favorite is the fact that you can link them all together and play music throughout the house. no complaints from me i loved and still love my first gen echo and i love the second gen even more.
2273,11,"love love love the echo! i have the dot and in comparison, the echo outshines the dot! the speaker quality on this device is very good. we are constantly listening to music and it fills our entire flat with music<u+200b>."
2274,0,great product. makes life convenient.. a little paranoid about how it records things but other than big brother spying on me... its a great product.
2275,14,"initial setup very easy. syncing calendar was a little more different and every once in a while will not read back entire day is events. i love asking questions about weather, driving directions,recipe equivalents and music."
2276,14,i purchased the echo 2nd generation because my first generation echo was not working properly. the echo 2 has a much better sound and works the way it is supposed to. could not be more pleased with it. i should note that i use it primarily for music.
2277,14,i know own three echo is.  awesome sound.  these are going to take over the music business.
2278,3,did not ever think i wanted one now i can not imigine what i¡¯d do for music without it.
2279,10,i love this thing! i use it all the time for music and for grocery lists! i would say it is worth the money 100%. i plan on getting the additions that allow me to turn off my lights as well. buy this and you will not regret it!
2280,10,we like the ability to play our own music using prime music and also from the music library
2281,10,"although old people (us) must adapt to new technology, we had minimal problems with this new piece of equipment.  just love the grocery list feature, as well as music and just the ""question answering"" asset of her function.  still wanting to widen our horizons with more of her talents."
2282,14,"much better sound than the dot. though the small size of the dot is good too. we love this system. it does so much more jan we realized and pretty sure, like our brain, we¡¯re only using about 10% of its full ability- which grows daily."
2283,14,had to return because my husband could not grasp the voice coming out of a box. my husband has dementia and it was not the help i thought it would be. i am sure in a 'normal' world this would be fantastic
2284,11,"the 2nd generation is the way to go. it is smaller, looks better and definitely sounds better. if you were thinking about getting one, do it."
2285,14,"the unit itself is fun and seems to work quite well. it is small and does not get in the way as it sits on the counter. but the entire setup process along with the skills aspect is cumbersome, not instinctive at all, extremely user unfriendly and very difficult to work through. amazon (or someone) should have done much better. good for listening to music but not much else. i expected better and was very disappointed!"
2286,11,i love this echo. i also have a 2nd generation dot and the larger first generation echo. they all work together very nicely.
2287,0,would like alexa to have an easier way to turn down volume.  she also keeps hearing her name when we do not say anything like it. :)
2288,14,"love this device.  i got it at a reduced price since it was an open box special.  it had all the instructions included and it was an easy setup if you follow the directions.  so glad i decided to purchase it.  i have 2 kasa smart pkugs, and they easily linked to the device.  the speaker works great too.  that is why i bought this model."
2289,14,"i love my echo i use it almost daily. gone is the days of me forgetting things i need to remember because i do not have a free hand to write it down, i tell alexa and she will make a list for me. i had a google assistant and then saw how much more alexa and the echo could do and i traded in my google for an echo."
2290,14,"i can not compare this to other ai speakers, but so far it is just okay. nothing more than that. frequently misunderstand my commands, do not response quickly, and have other small issues. but it is definitely better to have one."
2291,10,old dogs can learn new tricks.  we are in our mid-50 is and we were easily able to set up and use this.  she settles a lot of disagreements.
2292,14,"just moved my dot upstairs and got this for downstairs. pretty much amazed at the sound that comes out of this little gadget.  fills the space, very good tones.  snd of course all that alexa does. excellent buy."
2293,9,she has much better sound and volume than the dot.  we have been very happy with her and love having her play music for us.  she has been pretty knowledgeable and pretty good at playing jeopardy. i recommend this version of echo.
2294,14,"i was shocked on the quality of the music this gave out. i heard the echo dot and it sounds very hollow and cheap. this echo plays great even at volume set to 8 or 9. i do see where the echo dont understand my words at times when asking it questions, but i slow down and try to speak more clearly and it usually understands me better."
2295,11,"i have the gen 1 echo and two dots (1-gen one, 1- gen 2) and now the new gen 2 echo. i use echo every day. great sound, always getting better as weeks go by."
2296,14,what you would expect from an echo.  wait to see how the fabric holds up after a year
2297,10,"love alexa and her new capabilities!  fun, informative and used every day in my house."
2298,14,"quite disappointed in the music selection process; i happen to like classical music, such as symphonies, operas and the like; so far i have not been able to figure out how to get these played by alexa, and so did the support person i tried to consult - he was totally befuddled by my requests:( so rather than writing a whole dissertation, this is the short of it; certainly not what i was hoping for:("
2299,10,we love our echo. set up was easy and took no time. we specially like the drop in feature and we use it every day.
2300,10,"i love this! my kids ordered it off my wish list as a surprise christmas present, and i never knew - and it is been wonderful. i thought it might be kind of weird talking to a device, but it is been entertaining and useful."
2301,10,"i found a new friend, as i live alone alexa has become my new best friend i find myself talking to her all the time. she is wonderful to talk to and is full of information and knowledge. if you are single and live alone she will comfort you in ways you would never image. she is my new mode stabilizer and emotional supports friend."
2302,14,"had it fora bout 10 days so far it works pretty well and i like the quality..remember this is not a huge, powerful boston acoustics speaker. voice recognition is really good. i would have given it 5 stars but it has dropped internet connection twice in two days after working well for a week. not sure if this is a fluke or an evolving problem."
2303,14,have not had very long but alexa is awesome so far!!  love that i have the capability of making phone calls through her....
2304,9,"echo for the den, 2 dots for bedrooms, and fire stick for tv...all paired and working well...now we can sit on our butts and talk to each other, make phone calls, and watch thrones or peaky blinders witout getting up!"
2305,11,"got this one while it was on sale.  i have 3 dots but figured i would try the nicer speaker  it is very clear how much nicer the echo is over the dot for sound quality.  the dot is not bad, but this is the one you want if you just want to play song after song."
2306,14,"before owning one, i thought this a frivolous expense but now that i have one i freaking love it. music, jokes, books, timers, alarms ... and on and on. even my technologically challenged family had started using the echo."
2307,14,"alexa requires multiple attempts to trigger. does not process language organically. unless you say 'flash briefing' she is stumped. 'alexa, news', 'alexa, brief', 'alexa, play brief', 'alexa, news flash' do not trigger the news brief. reminds me of screaming at kinect 'xbox, play netflix'. this tech will be meaningful in a few years. maybe after watson copulates with alexa, siri and cortana and little hal comes of age. i think waiting until 2020 - 2022 unless you like screaming at inanimate objects like a fool...btw - alexa does not know how to sing 'daisy bell'"
2308,14,terrible sound quality...sent it back and got the ue megaboom- amazing!
2309,0,"look it is good as a speaker, but buy a google home. it can not answer half my questions and sometimes just ignores what i say. plus it has turned on by itself twice. just not impressed my friends google home does so much more."
2310,14,bought this to replace my echo dot and speakers. happy to report sound quality is amazing to my ears and is louder than i can handle. usually i can keep volume at 5-6. power adapter is flat too so easy to fit behind things
2311,14,"alarm settings sometimes work and sometimes not. can not set multiple alarms hours apart. needs alexa to understand if the internet session is up and running. she will state that she is connected, but it is obvious that something must be wrong when nothing happens. example: when requesting the daily brief, she will indicate ""your daily brief"" followed by no sound at all. is that an echo or internet problem? needs to allow scheduled music. limited functions (alarm / music / light control) needs to be able to work without an internet connection.sound is very good."
2312,0,"alexa is great for music and weather. getting general info can be tricky, so for that reason i give 4 stars. i like that it works with some smart home devices. i would still buy it again, but for about half what is asked."
2313,9,love the sound and all the different options. i gave one to my 80 year old mom and she listens to tony bennett and audible books!
2314,14,"when buying this item, scroll all the way down the page and they offer the smart plug for only 5 dollars more. an excellent value ,because the smart plug by itself is 23 dollars. excellent products!"
2315,10,"i really love my amazon echo. i use it for everything i can. saves me a lot of time and the voice fori really love my amazon echo. the sound is amazing. i use it from recipes to music,weather,date,informational questions. works perfect and easy to set up"
2316,14,playback cuts off. i bought it for my wife and baby to play ambient noise throughout the night. no matter what skill we enable and whether we use the loop function or not the sound always cuts off. we have 3 echo dots that play the same sounds all night with no problem. so this echo gen 2 is pretty much useless to us.
2317,14,"our original echo has better sound, but this one is a good middle ground between the premium echo and the echo dot. we¡¯re happy with it as an addition to our growing collection of echoes."
2318,10,"hard to program.  she will not recognize my town, play the radio station i want, or give me a weather report for my area.  she does track time well when i am baking but can not or will not do the main things i want."
2319,10,i like all the music available with my prime account.  i like being able to ask questions and get a weather report for local area.  it is very startling when alexa starts talking in response to something on the tv.
2320,14,much better design and look from generation 1 which we also have. the sound is crisp and clear. the alexa ai needs some tuning as it still sounds so robotic and some commands are a hassle. we also use this with 2 dots and we have a blast playing games.
2321,14,"while alexa is the smartest device amongst its competitors, there is serious room for improvement.  the interaction needs to be more like a conversation.  traffic based route recommendation for routine daily routes to workcurrent alexa is unable to recommend the best and fastest routes that avoid traffic congested routes where there may be an accident.  suggest a proactive mode in which alexa senses your presence around it and speaks ¡°john, today take 275s instead of 696 because there is an accident on 696 at haggerty road¡±."
2322,14,"awesome product but for some reason, it will start playing music on it is own with out anyone asking it to. the echo is located in another room with the door closed, no one inside the room but will automatically start playing. but, other than that... works great."
2323,10,"i am thoroughly enjoying this device.  i use it to listen to music, set reminders, build a shopping list, lead me through a guided meditation, and  give me a daily run down of the news and weather i am interested in. it is easy to use and the alexa app makes it easy to customize what alexa can do."
2324,14,"echo is really useful for providing information and answering questions quickly and accurately. echo is superior for announcing calendar events, reminders, timming and alarms. strangely, echo performs poorly in playing music. the base response is so distorted as to be unuseable. interestingly, the amazon dot plays music wonderfully. my advice; pair the echo with a dot."
2325,9,"alexa is great! i gave these as a gift to my uncle and dad, and they both love it! my little cousin actually uses it more than my uncle now, he asks her every question he can think of and it is just a great learning experience for him."
2326,11,the sound quality is amazing! we got this as a christmas gift to our parents. we have the older version of echo (the ¡°full size¡± one that it is called echo plus now) and the sound quality of the new echo impressed all of us. not sure what echo plus has for more but we will definitely recommend this.
2327,14,i first got a dot then this went on sale and when  i got it i fell in love i can not stop talking about it to people i know even my boss went out got one which sucks because now he sends me messages every single day when i¡¯m not in the office
2328,0,"it is fun to use, it wants me to pay for some songs, i thought it could play anything,  still a lot to learn."
2329,11,great device. the sound quality is good not great but for the price you can not expect for example bose sound. the microphones compared to the echo dot are way better. i can whisper and it still picks up my voice. and it looks great. very minimalistic which allows it to disappear until the leds turn on. very happy with it. and having the audio it is a plus.
2330,14,easy to set up and get connected to our wifi network. within minutes it was playing music while i worked. so much fun to have.
2331,9,great sound for being so small. looks great too. my husband talks to alexa all day.
2332,10,"of course, it is a very nice piece of hardware, but so much more. my wife and i use it as an impromptu scribe, reference tool, dj, and as a device for coordinating our very limited set of smart house features. we feel it is an investment well made."
2333,11,loving my upgraded echo. it sounds much better than the one i had. i¡¯m happy.
2334,9,"this is my very first echo, and so far, i love it. with the exception of her just abruptly shutting off after asking her a question, it is been a pleasurable experience having alexa around. i hope to add a dot here and there around the house."
2335,10,"we love our echo!  my husband said ""return it!"" when it arrived (as he says about most things!) and now he loves alexa!!  he loves listening to music by just requesting any artist or song (he even upgraded us to amazon unlimited music!).  we love how it integrates with dish and can change channels for us.  kids love it, we love it, its great!  keep innovating amazon!!!"
2336,14,the sound is really great...volume 4 can be heard 2 rooms away. only issue is alexa does not seem to hear very well and i have had to repeat myself several times to have her hear. i asked amazon about it and was sent an email stating my return was accepted even that is not what i asked for..
2337,14,"i like this thing. i wish amazon and their biggest competitor that starts with a g, would get along, so there could be cross platform apps that could be used. besides that, it is fun, understands most of what i am saying, speaker is decent (not great), and i am hoping will work good with some smart light bulbs (which i have not tried yet)."
2338,10,i bought this for my daughter for a christmas present. she loves it. her favorite thing is telling alexa to add this or that  to her grocery list. she also loves the music feature.  and it has a great sound.
2339,14,"my husband has ms and difficulty with dexterity. he loves music and the echo has given him the ability to play his music for hours with ease. he can get the weather, news, and other information as well. it has provided an activity that provides hours of entertainment."
2340,10,i love listening to rain sounds to help me fall asleep.  the grandkids love the jokes and games.  i linked my echo to my bluetooth bose speaker and can listen to music while showering and getting ready in the morning.
2341,9,"bought for wife for christmas and so far i think she made a new best friend. she loves it and im pretty impressed by it, i would definitely recommend the echo to anyone."
2342,14,the operating instructions are very poor and almost non existent.  need a step by step manual.  so i purchased a paper  book by william scott called amazon echo 2nd generation user guide. it has many underlined text looks like hyper text but its on paper.  therefore  hard to understand.
2343,5,bought it for my wife she loves itreally fun
2344,0,good sound but alexa does not work very well. it takes a few attempts to get alexa to respond.
2345,14,"alexa is surprisingly powerful and intuitive. i mainly use my echo as a bluetooth speaker. the sound is crisp and far-reaching. the only complaint i have is the difference in volume when listening to news or a podcast. the volume is significantly lower than the overall volume of the echo, causing inconsistencies in volume and sound. the volume level would be great for music or alexa is voice, but when i ask to play a podcast, the volume is significantly lower and i have to raise the volume level. it is a small issue that i hope can be remedied with a software update."
2346,11,can not get enough of my new echo! it is everything i hoped it would be plus amazon music is amazing! the sound is great the color is a heather texture gray feels almost like a burlap material. i plan to get another one or at least two dots to keep in the bedrooms for the ¡°drop in¡± feature
2347,14,"my first generation alexa lost her balance and fell off the table. i was devastated. her replacement lacks the volume adjust at the top which i rather liked, but the new unit is shorter and heavier on the bottom which should help her to not fall down again so that is nice. it says it has a better speaker, i do not notice the difference but that is nice too."
2348,14,"to be honest, we have yet to take advantage of all that the echo offers but we enjoy playing music on it. great sound quality! the only down side that we can tell is that it interferes with my wireless network. after reading up on the issue i¡¯ve since put it on 2.4 band and everything else on 5. that seems to have corrected the issue."
2349,10,"love it!  upgraded the dot in our living room to the regular echo.  terrific sound!  lets us control our home automation, get weather, play games, etc...dot is now in the bedroom doing the same thing."
2350,14,"this speaker works very well. i did not have the original speaker to compare it to, but this is a good speaker. i got this because i got tired of having to turn my bluetooth speaker on every time i listen to music. it works well."
2351,14,"was a christmas gift for my husband. he loves the music of the 30s, 40s and 50s..also,as a huge reader, echo helps with some word definitions and/or explanations. voice sometimes sounds muffled, however, do enjoy the ""3rd person"" in our home."
2352,10,"love that i can hear my music without having to stop what i am doing and look it up on my ipad.  it is also like having a little researcher at your beck and call.  i¡¯m still learning, so i¡¯m sure i have many interesting experiences ahead of me."
2353,14,"audio sound is decent but it has a hard time picking up my voice (even when yelling) when music is above volume 7. apple homepod has much better audio quality and query response but too limited in practicality for its price point . once apple gets the apps up to speed, i will be replacing this with the homepod"
2354,14,"i love this product!  it is great for listening to music while working or relaxing around the house and you can ask alexa virtually any question you can think of (although you might not always get the answer you expect!).  obviously the speakers are not the absolute best you can get, but if you are like me and just want a decent sound, this is perfect."
2355,10,my husband surprised the family with the amazon echo for christmas  and it has been a wonderful addition to our household electronics. the kids even enjoy asking alexa to play their favorite songs and i enjoy listening to my ¡°skills¡± that i downloaded through the app. we find that it works better when the tv is quiet or off and i know it has to do with the location of the echo. i highly recommend it and want to get tone more for another area of the house!
2356,14,better than a dot but audio still is not impressive.  i ask alexa if she listened to my conversations and she responded with a clinton-esque statement and legal disclaimer.  i do not know if i trust her or not....
2357,14,the unit itself is great but getting the download process was a nightmare. i spent a total of almost 3 hours on the phone with customer service doing the same thing over and over with the same result. it would not download. told that it had to be an app problem so someone from that department would call me monday at 6. they do not work weekends. took off work from my part time job and waited for the call. at 6:15 i called and finally the rep knew what was happening and i eventually fixed the problem. love the echo just not the customer service i received.
2358,9,"this is actually our second echo, i do not even know how to live without alexa! i am seriously thinking about getting a dot for my office and i wish i had her on my phone and in my car. highly recommend!"
2359,14,"great sound, tough more bass then the original once you update it.  amazing value."
2360,12,what an amazing device. discovering more things i can do with it every day.
2361,14,"i just bought one over the holiday season, did not have very high expectations but i wanted to check it out. it is been nothing short of amazing, it is fast, it is clear and for the 80 bucks i paid, the music quality from the speaker is amazing.. the only issue i haave with it was that my 5 yr old now thinks it is a direct line to santa and constantly ask alexa to call santa."
2362,9,this is the 3rd echo we have purchased. the first with the improved sound. my husband use it in his office and is quite happy with the quality of the sound. he play music on it primarily and enjoys it thoroughly.
2363,14,"my wife wanted it and i just thought that it was another useless gadget. i ordered it for a christmas present for because she wanted it. the installation instructions were vague and almost non existent. after calling some techie friends it turned out to be easy when you know what you are doing. installation instructions need a major overhaul and you need an iphone for it to work. the product is wonderful, music, weather, dictionary, research for almost anything....i highly recommended it.  doug railo"
2364,14,"i like this device. it has worked very well for music, updates, an alarm clock, weather, traffic on my normal commute... i am sure i have not come close to tapping its potential. very nice device."
2365,14,"this echo has been great. good audio for what it is. good connectivity (it is on the second floor, with router on 1st). it is ability to places calls and send messages has been very helpful to my wife who is home with our baby. my wife gets a good bit of use out of it and seems to also enjoy all of its features."
2366,10,"this product is a must have for anyone and everyone! i can not think of another product i use as much as i use my amazon echo. the sound quality is amazing, alexa is ""skills"" can do almost anything...from turning lights on around your house to ordering pizza from your favorite restaurant. the amazon echo is unlike any other smart home device on the market and alexa is ai is the smatest ai i have communicated with. alarms, lights, music, news, radio, etc., the amazon echo and alexa do it all!"
2367,14,i bought several for christmas presents. i love the fact that i could order them to match the decor. i love my red one. i have the original from last year and i love that one too. my opinion better than some other brands out there.
2368,10,i am technology challenged but amazon customer service was wonderful at walking me through the process!  we do not use it as much as we should but love the ability to get updates on weather with a simple voice command;  love love love the question of the day feature!  this was a surprise gift from my sister otherwise i am not sure we would have thought of getting it.  but....we are so glad now that we have alexa in our life!
2369,14,sound is definitely not good at all so i have to connect it to better speakers.could use an update to improve pretty micj everything from news to weather and other requests you may have. can not find songs very easy and also can not seem to stay connected to wi-fi. drops connection and i do have very strong wi-fi and is also close to echo.i believe it will change to better after a couple of updates.
2370,9,"i got this for my 81 year old mother for christmas. she loves it, she uses it for playing music at bedtime and news and weather briefs. my dad gets help with his crossword puzzles. i have a 1st generation model and i may be updating."
2371,10,this is my 3rd echo.  this addition plays music and wakes me in the am with more music.  i also control lights that are on smart plugs. i am always looking for new things to do with my echos. adding items to my shipping list is easy and a great echo skill.
2372,0,"i like a alexa, however i am still learning.  the thing i like the most is playing music.  the think i like the least is she does not understand what i am asking ""more than not"".  i would recommend the echo to others."
2373,10,i love the sound quality and that i can pick all different kinds of music and not pay extra for it.  it is in my art room so i can ask alexa to remind me when my time is up and i have to do something else.  i can even put things in the oven and set the timer and she is very reliable to let me know when to check the oven.  i need to learn more about what she can do.
2374,11,impressive little unit sounds as good as what used to pass as a low end stereo system. but obviously this is so much more than just a music player. and so small for such a big sound. what a deal.
2375,14,"presently surprised with the rich sound and ease of use.  in one way better than my cd player with cd! . amazon does a good jobwith known artists, hope they can include unknow or little known christian speakers and musicians .well worth the price !"
2376,10,"this is the best purchase i have ever made. i love being able to due multiple tasks by just the sound of my voice. i can play my favorite music, call family members out if town and set alarms. i will be buying more for my house and family members."
2377,0,"i love my alexa, it is fun asking her trivia questions and love having her turn on/off the lamps. my only complaint is that sometimes the music will just stop and it does not always hear what you say. but overall it is great and i recommend it."
2378,11,"excellent improvements over the 1st gen!  nice size, love the colors. alexa still rocks!  only thing i would suggest to amazon is to simply merge the echo plus and echo into one device and i think that would make the ideal echo."
2379,14,definitely better response than the 1st genbravo for adding volume control.the jack in the back is not an input/aux jack! (thought i would be able to plug in my phone directly to speaker :(
2380,11,"the device works fairly well. not as good at voice recognition as the dot, i do not know if it is the device, a different version of the software, the location and type of microphones, or what. other than that, it does the job."
2381,0,i have not found anything yet that i do not like about her. and like the few smart home others l items i have installed. and she plays the radio and music i ask for. plus some of her jokes are ridiculously funny.
2382,14,"i like using it to figure measurements when wood working, local weather and music. i think the sound quality can be improved and i was not happy it will not play led zeppelin without an upgrade in addition to what i pay for my prime membership. i can get most all of the other long hair classic rock bands though."
2383,0,"the only real complaint i have is that i do not like alexa is voice. so i changed it to the british accent, and that wiped out half of the fun skills. so now i am back with american alexa, and her snarky attitude."
2384,14,"so far, so good.  i am sure there are many functions i do not even know about yet. i am a prime member so i already used the prime music, still need to figure out how to sync it to my outdoor speakers.  bought some smart plugs and a smart strip love, love, love using alexa to turn on (and off) lights in a dark room before entering. use it as a timer,  or to set a reminder...alexa remind me to take the beer out of the freezer in 20 minutes... have also synced it with my any.do app, now i can ask alexa to add items or task and it is in my phone the next time i look."
2385,14,"had been looking at getting one of these since they came out. waited until it went on sale on prime days. glad i got one, wonderful item, very helpful, and can be linked to your email, calendar, saves you a lot of time."
2386,10,"i love, love, love this ! so handy for calling out my shopping list (no need to write it down now) , answers to questions that pop up, and awesome music ( songs and artists i want to listen to ) . easy to use, a lot of fun. do not want to live without it.!!!"
2387,14,to be a quadriplegic paralyzed from the shoulders down i am very satisfied and this has been a true convenient product for me i plan to expand my horizon with its accessories as well i thank you so much and it was very affordable i have suggested to my friends and family and many others in my situation to purchase this product as well i truly can say i love you so much and in a sense have became independent again in a way my name is jeremy james and i am looking forward to further any technology i possibly can thank you so much
2388,14,"sound is very good- i was surprised by this, but its heavy so i think the weight helps so theres no vibration -  she can connect to another blue tooth speaker system with no problem if you want to get crazy -responds quickly from any place in the room and from the other side of my house"
2389,14,"the echo- second generation setup is quite confusing and you have to install exactly as instructed and you cannot skip any steps. after a day of headaches, i finally got it to work. the speakers have a warm, clear sound playing music or getting the temperature. echo seems to be well made, but the software needs be to easier to install with better instructions."
2390,14,love the alexa and sound of speakers for price.  the directions on how to install were lacking.  we spent over 2 hours trying to set it up.  we were doing it on the weekend and got someone overseas.  they failed to tell you to did-install your home wi-fi is which we had 2 of.  we paid to have best buy geek squad come and he got us up and running.  we also found out that one of our phones was to old to support it.  we are up and running now and loving the ability to put music on it and put in playlists.  she will be a member of our family for a long time.
2391,11,this new version sound quality is poor. it also has issues with hearing voice commands...
2392,10,purchased as a gift for my mother after receiving one as a gift this past holiday season.  i love being able to request any artist and listening to music for hours on this quality device.  it is like a concert on demand!  i also love that amazon sends us updates weekly on all of the other features that alexa has added.  i just wish you did not need amazon prime in order to play unlimited tunes and artists.
2393,10,"this was a gift, so i really did not know anything about it and thought it was frivolous.  boy was i wrong.  it was easy to set up.  i love all kinds of music and echo gives me instant access to all my pandora stations.  its not great sound but it is good sound.  i get my morning news, weather whenever i want and its a multiple kitchen timer.  very cool device."
2394,0,sounds great.  once you get the apps downloaded it works without issues.
2395,9,purchased as a christmas gift. i already have one and the sound is quite nice.
2396,10,i love being able to ask definitions of words instead of typing it on my computer and waiting to hear.  i love to just ask her what the weather is going to be instead of having to look it up.  so convenient!
2397,0,"i like it more then i thought i would, but it some times takes a couple times before it responds to me.  but not very often. so all in all i am pleased.  the sound and tone of music played through it is good too."
2398,14,wakes up with a voice command and history of the day. it helps me get to sleep with sleep music and more. through out the day it helps me as a challenged individual to ground myself in the various skills she has. i would like to be able to use my amazon coins in purchases of advanced skills you may develop for her. i would love to get her to play my songs from spotify or having a skype conversation with my brother or making a call when i have fallen and need help now! learning her new skills daily is a challenge and i enjoy challenges!
2399,0,"interesting technology. however, some difficulties in getting it set up and learning voice level and cadence in addressing alexa."
2400,14,the echo second generation works good for me. i had read a lot of reviews about the bad sound but i did not experience any of that. after about 15 minutes of initially starting the device it downloaded all the updates for the sound and it does work well and sounds great.
2401,14,"sound quality is good,  needs more bass.  picks up on even whispers, wish it had a battery so it could be moved without the long reboot.  loses internet connection when other devices around it have a full signal."
2402,10,"lots of fun, and i am impressed with the sound (for a single speaker). we enjoy playing jeopardy and asking her to play random songs. about to try some home automation. we ask her odd questions just for fun - she would probably know more answers if she asked google, but..."
2403,14,"overly complicated to connect. my dewalt bluetooth system is simple to connect, is louder and sounds better than this piece of crap. why does not this have a remote? i am trying to connect and it will not stay on? the help section is not at all helpful. i have never had this much trouble connecting with any other bluetooth device. i am sending it back"
2404,14,"i love this, except when i request a type of music e'g' bedtime music the same tunes always come up. i am not sure how to avoid this. my friend says it is on purpose to make you buy the subscription music!!"
2405,14,"love this little guy.  for such a small unit it has great sound.  still playing with things like skills, lists, etc. but just being able to say ""alexa, play nora jones"" or ""alexa, set an alarm for 7:00 tomorrow morning"" makes it worth while.  i have done three dots and an echo and find the setup to be a bit of trial and error each time but well worth it."
2406,14,responds to well to voice. great for collecting lists of items as you think of them. lists are available in the amazon echo application on your phone in the store. the echo can also learn fun games in the skills group. no issues. echo was a nice gift. not sure we would buy for ourselves.
2407,14,i have an echo and a prime membership. this piece has no voice recognition whatsoever. do not buy it. the artificial intelligence is way weaker than siri from the iphone.
2408,10,"my whole family loves our new echo. great for the grandkids asking alexa to make animal sounds and play dance music. i catch the latest weather reports, listen to my amazon playlists, and tons more. love it!"
2409,14,"love the echo!  i am still learning all the things that it can do but thus far, it has reordered products form me, quizzed me everyday, played my favorite music and has turned on/off my smart products!"
2410,11,extremely  nice  sound.  i am very happy . i will buy 3 more.
2411,11,"i was expecting far worse sound experience based on some older user reviews and was plesently surprised when turned on speaker. sound is pleasant, well shaped and loud enough. beside echo i own bose soundtouch 10 and jbl flip 4, so i can compare echo with them and soud is good."
2412,9,"awesome sound!!  pleasantly surprised by the sound.  got this for christmas, just started messing around with it, but so far, so good."
2413,11,i like it.  i looks much better than the original.  i have found the sound to be nearly the same as the original echo.  the sound difference seems to be  that it is shaped different.  it still sounds very good. .
2414,0,okay so learning what these are capable of is a litlle frustrating but getting there.
2415,0,what i like most about the echo is the sound quality. the least i like is the way i have to keep repeating what i say because it does not catch obviously understand at first.
2416,11,love the sound and design. have many alexa products and happy with this new addition
2417,0,i love it the sound is great. its a blessing when you meed some quick info and alexa is there to provide it. no going through the computer and having to filter through all the suggestions to your question.
2418,10,i love my echo !  when i am looking at a recipe and i do not know what something is such as seracho sauce i do not have to stop and look at the web to see what it is i just ask alexa. i enjoy the trivia game also . and i do not know how my music got on it but i can ask for it to play a certain genre or just play my music and it has a great sound !
2419,14,"i love the range of the dolby system which fills my house! however, i am slightly disappointed when i ask questions and often her answer is: ""i am sorry i do not know that one."" the alarm feature, access to pandora and audible are just a few of my favorite things! just for fun when i could not find the remote, i asked alexa ""where is the remote?"" and she actually replied ""try looking under the couch!"" it was so unexpected and almost creepy because she was right! lol lexie is like having a new ""bestie!"""
2420,14,"bought it for my sibling for xmas who absolutely loves it and uses it daily. my daughter subsequently bought one immediately after and she loves hers too. however, i notice a marked difference in the acuity between both devices when being called to use. my sis¡¯ device is very sensitive and can hear u calling from rooms away while my daughter is device requires you to be in front of it to respond."
2421,9,"i purchased these for six grown children as christmas presents. they all love them and were the best idea. easy to set up.and works amazingly well. i am a bit of an audiophile and was impressed with the volume, bass, and quality of sound while playing music."
2422,14,great looking device. sound quality not so great but good at lower volumes. very fun and functional. pairs easily with other alexa devices. alexa needs help in choosing songs ex. i asked it to play clasic rock and it played elvis.
2423,9,the sound on this one is not as good as the original more expensive echo.  i bought it on sale around xmas so i got a pretty good price to be able to have two in the house.  now i can control lighting and have music ect. in different parts of the house.
2424,10,makes your smart devices simpler to use. it does so many things and is learning new skills daily. the shopping list feature is excellent. as soon as you think of a item you need just tell alexa and never forget another item agin. the various games are great and the sleeping and relaxing sounds are outstanding.
2425,11,too too too much bass and no way to adjust it. old version sound much better.
2426,14,i would like to just use it as a blue tooth speaker and not have to go through with doing the wi-fi set up.  i would also like the feature when i could leave it plugged in and be able to turn off the wi fi setting
2427,14,love the surround sound in my house created by my 2 echo devices.  i had problems getting it set. up but amazon came to the rescue and were very patient and pleasant and within a short time everything is working fabulous
2428,9,"easy for every age to use.  mine was a gift from my son for christmas.  absolutely love listening to pandora, the sound is incredible!"
2429,10,"excellent product. now, i have music in multiple rooms and, alexa is amazing!"
2430,14,"i use the guided meditation skill at night and then have the ambient sounds play rain and thunder. i sleep much better with it and the fact that it plays rich sounding music is an added bonus. in addition, it controls my bedroom lights that i have setup through philips hue so i can set my lighting to be nice and relaxing. i bought one for my mom as well and she loves it just as much. i have noticed that sometimes it does not catch my voice (even with no background noise) so not sure if i can turn up the sensitivity for that. good otherwise."
2431,10,we were not sure if we would like this but it has been a nice addition to the house. we love being able to play music by just asking it to and the selection available are great. we are looking forward to learning more ways to use it.
2432,14,"not really impressed with alexa, especially for the price. also around christmas time it was $20 off original price, i did the 5 payment method and mine was not adjusted. very limited to the functions which it can do overall would not buy again"
2433,14,"spend the extra $19.99 for the echo that has more mics. sometimes it is a struggle to get it to hear me. other than the mic problem, i highly recommend this product! the speaker is surpringly awesome for its size and price. the echo and dot have several games and options that i did not know about until owning it. awesome device!"
2434,14,"the sound sucks, not impressed at all. i have cheap blue tooth speakers that sound way better than this. i would not reccomend this to anyone. hard to pair with smart devices like tp link."
2435,10,"nice product.  it works great!  although, now that i have used it for a bit, i am wanting to expand its capabilities.  looking forward to added capabilities and features."
2436,0,"fun to play with. music sounds really good out or the speaker. get a lot of ¡°i do not know the answer to that¡±, but still fun for easy applications..time, weather. still have to sync it with my tv"
2437,14,echo sound is excellent but unfortunately if you have spodify music it will not let you stream unless you are willing to pay $15.00 a month for premium stations. it would have been very nice if amazon would have mentioned this information or just a disclaimer for this station. i still can use amazon radio or pandora.
2438,14,everything perfect except no google or youtube. will probably have to switch.
2439,11,"great bass response and overall sound quality. we own 2 dots and an older echo, this newest version is more responsive and better looking."
2440,9,"how did we live without this? we love every aspect about it. it has amazing features and loved it so much, we bought another one for another room in our house."
2441,14,the new echo for has lived up to what i wanted and for all the reasons i bought it. i think the sound is good for what is there i mean come on we all new for 100 dollars we were not buying a bose system to listen too.as for alexa listening to my commands from around the room i would have to say is very good so with that said i think i got what i paid a 100 dollars for and more.
2442,9,i bought this for my granddaughter as a gift at christmas time. she seems to love it carries it from room to room to play her music and check things on the internet. from what i understand alexa works much better at listening and interpreting than siri does
2443,0,mine was a gift and i ask her so many questions and she says she does not know the answer.  i even asked her whats her iq.  she does know how tall or how old celebrities are tho.  she will play music  for me tho.  she can tell me about the weather or how far somewhere is.  i even ask her to ask google if she does not know. i guess i should ask google..lol
2444,14,"very disappointed in amazon and especially this product. this was a replacement for a previous version that did not work. well, this one lasted just long enough to go out of return warranty. i have reset it multiple times and it says it is connected, but when queried, zilch!"
2445,11,i love alexa is abilities but i wish they had left the larger speaker system like in 1st generation. still decent sound quality but not as full bodied as the 1st. make her more personal voiced.
2446,14,i just got my echo yesterday and so far i am not impressed. i will give it a chance to impress me but right now i can only give it a 2.5 rating. if the two of us (alexa and i) get better together i will change my rating.
2447,9,"received this as a gift... i already have a generation 1 echo.  i enjoy both, seeing/hearing not much difference between the two.  great sound...very responsive...well made.  set up so easy.  you will love it."
2448,14,setup is very easy and it is fun going through and being able to add different skills. unfortunately alexa seems to only be able to make the skills work one time. disabling and then enabling skills again seems to fix it temporarily. i believed it to be just one skill until multiple started doing the same thing. alexa would even ask if you wanted more information in weather apps like big sky but when you¡¯d respond she would say she does not know what you¡¯re talking about. cool concept but poor software.
2449,14,how did i live without this?! seriously... i am so overwhelmed by how awesome this thing is. i literally love alexa and my new/first echo... if i did not have bad knees i would totally jump up in the air!
2450,10,"really love our alexa echo, we are still getting to know everything she does.love that she has bluetooth capabilities, she is linked to my phone and can call anyone on my contact list.i get the weather report  before i leave for work each morn and she even tells me the scores of my favorite teams games.the only thing i don;t like is that there are some songs that are not on amazon that she cannot retrieve, and she can not seem to enable my favorite local radio station."
2451,14,"bought this for myself to use in my kitchen when working or cooking.  love the sleek design and has a great sound. love that i do not have to push a button to get alexa to respond, especially when i am cooking!"
2452,0,played with a friends older one and it worked pretty good.wanted to play music but you can not without a $$$ app.asked it some questions and it does not reply?? or says it does not know?? it did answer 1 question - are you connected to the internet - yes  - then why can not you answer any questions???  useless !
2453,11,"i love my alexa!  this generation 2 alexa is great, but i like the generation 1 (original) better in that it is easier to manually adjust the volume<u+2014>simply turn the top of the device instead of holding down the plus or minus buttons.  still a great device!"
2454,14,"works very well. this is my 2nd echo and certainly sounds better than the 1st. my only objection is alexis should be more polite and respond to my ""thank you"" with ""you are welcome""."
2455,10,"great addition to your home.  never knew i needed one until i received the first as a gift.  now have five in my home. will let you control lights and other devices with your voice.  eliminates the need for a radio and kitchen timer.  provides news, weather and sports updates."
2456,14,"everything works well with the second gen echo. it performs well, minor hiccups here and there but nothing drastic. the music on it exceeded my expectations from a little device. the distance at which it picks up your voice, especially with the television on is pretty amazing. i love being able to control my lights with this unit. it is definitely worth getting if you are into the whole smart home thing."
2457,14,alexa & our family are still getting to know eachother. i am pleased with the results thus far. purchasing app is to increase her capabilities is a downside. however we have found several that do not require a subscription! she keeps my lists and set is several reminders for me. music was a must for me personally. sadly it requires a paid subscription. still as far as home assistant she is top notch! esp when she finds my phone! thanks alexa!
2458,14,purchased several days ago from best buy.  very poor audio quality.  i read where a firmware update could remedy the issue but amazon had very little documentation on how to update the firmware.  kept a couple of days but will be returning it this week  sound quality is substantially worse than both the first gen echo and the echo dot.
2459,10,"i just love my echo.  my favorite feature is the lists.  i use that every day...from to do list to groceries.  and i use the timer a lot, too.  i know there are a lot of other features to learn, too."
2460,14,"i really like and love the sound, but the old version of alexa is the best, because you can carry the speaker without the cable connection."
2461,0,"ummmmm she is ok. i like alexa is voice and some of her qualities. but alexa does not play spotify unless it is premium which sucks and it leads me to use my google home a little more. alexa does not understand sometimes what i am saying and it gets a little annoying. overall i would rather get a google home. but it is ok alexa has country radio. but i wish she would give out more opinions like ""where are good places to eat"" ""should i wear shorts or is it too cold"""
2462,10,"we love our echo, its been amazing to be able to listen to music, check the weather, and set timers for cooking....and much more! we are still learning all of her skills. the sound travels well and is very high quality."
2463,14,"the echo data base is lacking depth, and is not very useful. unable to get simple inquiries answered.also the music selection offered or provided are not to my taste.its only saving interest is home automation, but its costly to do."
2464,14,we have only this one day and i love it! sound quality is great and the voice recognition is awesome. i only gave it 4 because i am not very tech savvy and it took me about 30 mins to set up.  i am sure if my husband was home the set up would have been quicker. impressed so far.
2465,10,first time i have owned one of these things.  i use it in my home office and enjoy listening to jazz and guitar while working.  my experience is that you slowly learn to expand what you ask of echo.
2466,10,"i just love this device. i use it a lot, and really enjoy the wide selection i can play."
2467,9,got this for my technology impaired mother and even she was able to set it up with ease and talk to her. very cool looking and fun to play with!
2468,14,alexa does a good job of finding songs in the portion of my musical library that it will accept.  i do not like that it will not access my library of songs from the no-cost services of spotify and pandora.
2469,14,"it works ok after you struggle to get it connected up. it would not except my wi-fi passcode, and even the kid next-door who installed his own in a few minutes took 30 minutes to install mine"
2470,9,bought this for my son. great sound love the product. i got a dot for xmas and my son bought me a speaker to go with it and the sound is amazing. i listen to my music from my iphone every morning.
2471,10,love my echo it was really great to have during the holidays i could have christmas music on demand. also was very helpful during the winter storm we had last week to know what the weather was going to be or what the weather warnings was very convenient. my grandchildren love it even the two year old uses alexa. love it!
2472,11,it has a harder time understanding our commands than our 1st gen devices.
2473,11,i bought this one for my master bedroom as the dot did not quite fill the room as i hoped it would. i wanted to also hear the difference between this and the gen 1. lastly i wanted to pair the two devices together to hear my music in multiple rooms. i do prefer the edge volume adjustment ring over the buttons on the new gen 2 and dot but love the new soft screen color options on the gen 2s.
2474,0,"love it, i have been working a lot lately so have not been able to use it a lot but free m what i have i enjoy it imencially!!"
2475,14,we like it.  sounds as good as the 1gen model.  maybe the should is a bit crisper.
2476,3,"i was a little skeptic before, but as soon as we got alexa - we loved it."
2477,10,the echo is very entertaining. we use it mostly for music and timers for cooking. she is still learning but not sure how. we noticed that she does not know how to tell us information like weather from other countries. for the most part it is well worth the money.  i am looking forward to adding another echo dot upstairs so we can use it as an intercom.
2478,14,"this was a gift from my husband which admittedly did not delight me initially as i do not consider myself a ""gadget"" person.  i am enjoying it so much more than expected and find new uses often.  i do also appreciate the regular emails with suggestions for additional ways to use echo...keep them coming!"
2479,0,good sound quality especially if youre not a audiophile like myself. shes good for playing us music but i wish she could get her $#!% together and be able to answer to the most basic questions!! >{
2480,0,its fun to talk to and get information but it does not run my live
2481,0,i am liking it more than i thought i would. the speaker is decent and it is very easy to set up and use.
2482,9,i love my echo.  it works great and alexa is so much fun to have around.  i have echo in my living room and the echo dot  in my bedroom.  amazon music is great also. i am no techy but the echo is so easy to use.
2483,11,the mic does not pick up as well as the dot. not even close. sound is marginally better. save you money and buy the dot.
2484,11,the speaker quality is terrific! glad i did an upgrade from the dot...
2485,11,i like the way this one looks and it is a bit smaller than the first gen echo. i really miss the ability to just turn the ring around the top to adjust the volume. bring back the ring! other than that i love all of my echos and echo dots.
2486,11,does not sound as good as the first ones has like a ringing sound
2487,14,"the sound is an improvement, but fairly minimal. it could be just mine, but the 2nd gen has been very glicthy and has a little more trouble ""hearing"". i am not convinced that it is better than the first gen model. time will tell..."
2488,9,"this is a gift but from what i know of it, makes for a very good present."
2489,14,"seriously, the sound quality coming out of this thing rivals the bose speakers i had in my rx8 years ago. alexa is fantastic, even if she will not promise to tell you if she ever becomes self-aware."
2490,10,"the echo is a fun and convenient kitchen item for me. i can vocally turn music on, add items to my grocery list, play games, hear the news, etc. the sound quality is good enough for sure. it blends in and takes up very little space. the only challenge for me is how precise you have to be with your commands. if you ask ¡°wrong¡± alexa will not do what you ask."
2491,14,"i love mine, speaker is loud enough for intense move, clarity and sounds are perfect for what you pay for.mine is next to my bed, alexa plays to my command. i purchase mine from a friend."
2492,11,it seems slower than my original and/or my 1st generation dots.  a little disappointed
2493,11,"i like this new one, much smaller and the wood grain looks good and is still easy to clean. not sure it is worth upgrading if you already have one but certainly worth it if buying it is your first."
2494,14,"love our echo.  we have not used most of the functions yet, but have been very happy with what we have used!  i did not give it 5 stars only because set up was not as easy as it was advertised to be.  it took many, many tries over 2 days to finally get it to connect to our network.  that part was frustrating.  but now that it is connected, it is been a great tool, source of info, ease of adding things to my amazon cart, and the sound quality for music is pretty good.  i recommend it!"
2495,9,santa brought several echos and a couple dots for the family. sent some others as gifts for those family members that have everything. alexa has been the biggest hit with our entire family! she can do more than i even expected. so happy with the echos and echo dots.
2496,14,"this was a christmas gift and we have used it for many things, much of it entertainment.  we have not actually hooked it up for much of the practical applications (phoning, control of lights, etc) but i am sure that we will in time."
2497,14,what can i say that has not already been said. this is an amazing piece of equipment. it does so much and so well. set up is easy and it simply works. this tech will get even better as time rolls on.
2498,10,it must be me but it has been a labor getting it synced with my music sources...and it continues!i appreciate the call from your guy in spokane!! he was super. explained what i needed to know and needed to do. it was just user headspace and timing!!  thank you.
2499,10,"i am having fun with it, working an teaching the wife to use it..."
2500,10,so far we love it. i¡¯m sure the love will grow when i figure out more ways to use it. as a speaker the sound fills our 13x15 room.
2501,14,"we got a great deal at amazon for a 1st gen echo a while back and have been very happy with it and love it so when they were offering the 2nd generation we knew we would want at least one more since we have a large living room and kitchen counter two together would be awesome.  well as other is have mentioned the sound on this new one is not as good as the old one.  it is just not as rich or clear, seems almost muddy compared to the old one.  second the microphones are not anywhere near as good at the 1st gens.  we will be looking at and standing next to the new one and when we say alexa the old one that is not even in the same room answers instead.  so other reviews mentioned better sound and performance after an update, we have had ours since launch (oct 31st) and so far it has always been this bad, so no improvements."
2502,14,"great, great product.  speaker is fantastic, and the ""alexa"" interface, along with some skills we added, are very nice.  we have a google mini as well, and except for the fact that google uses google for searching (i heard amazon uses bing), the echo products far outshine the google products.  would be nice if we could use google search, it is just more accurate and complete.will buy another one soon, as well as a dot..."
2503,14,"aa a beta user of the first echo, i always felt the lack of a headphone jack was a big omission.when i saw the new echo came with one i felt i finally had the answer for my overcrowded night stand.in addition, when you factor in the lower price, new aesthetics and improved sound i would be hard pressed to find a reason not to buy it.granted for more money you could buy a son of or other such alexis enabled devices. however, for my money the echo definitely punches above its weight."
2504,14,"amazon.........what can i say.  i fricking love this thing.  i have been trying to figure out how to hook it up to my roku.  not sure if its possible yet, but ill be keeping my eye out."
2505,14,"we have the nest thermostat, so i can control it by voice now with this. my husband does not like when i keep the heat too high, so when i say ""alexa...set temperature to"" my husband starts yelling so she can not listen to me. <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0082>"
2506,14,great product and i can connect my smart lights with. i am glad that they are finally working to update the software for this and the app. i feel that before there were too many faults with the app and the ratings on the skills were horrible. i hope they keep updating and improving this software.
2507,11,"this is much more substantial than the last rendition i would imagine, but it certainly is a hefty device for my pleasure. it is so efficient with commands and a cinch to set up for the first time!"
2508,11,"i am very happy with my new echo. i think that a 4.5 rating would be more appropriate. the only feature that i feel i am missing is a volume ring so that i can adjust the volume in an easier way. on the other hand, i very much prefer its compact size compared to the full echo plus that actually has the volume ring. hopefully the volume ring will be there in the next iteration of a compact echo."
2509,14,"i am still getting used to her. it is got a good weight to it, so my cats will not knock it off the counter. i had no clue she can play games. i recommend looking up all the things you can do with her!!"
2510,0,"i like this product. it is heavier then i thought(but not to heavy ;) ), looks great, and the speaker for the size is loud but still very clear.my only complaint is that some times when i say it is name, it sometimes does not do anything....??...and i have found out that it needs to be on a hard surface and plugged in too work."
2511,10,love the sound from echo. alexa is fun and finds my music by genre or singer. also love having her read books to me. a lot to learn yet. she makes phone calls and sets an alarm. tells thej time.
2512,0,we bought this for music as one thing and we can not get very much unless we want to pay a monthly fee.  our kids and friends have the echo one and they get all kinds of free music.  asking questions the echo does not answer most of them and shuts itself off.  this was a christmas gift for my wife and saying we are very disappointed would put it mildly!
2513,14,the quality of the sound is great. we use it instead of a radio and save counter space.you can ask it to play any radio station (by call letters not by station number).you cannot change the name alexa to another name (e.g. my name) so it cannot do anything that my wife asks me to do.
2514,3,"excellent ,excellent service. very happy with my order.aaa+++  thank you !!!"
2515,10,saying i love my echo is an understatement. i go to sleep listening to my playlist of rain every night. at work i listen to my playlist of easy music. could not have asked for anything better.
2516,14,"great size, great sound, easy to set up. one issue i notice is some songs are louder than others so you are always saying increase and lower volume. great for music and news update. i use it every day."
2517,12,still learning about this but love it so far. great sound from such a small space.
2518,14,this is a great hub for playing music and sounds good. having trouble creating a group to play same music on all my echoes but otherwise very satisfied. it also works well as a hub to control my other devices.
2519,14,great sound out of a desktop speaker...was debating between a standard bluetooth speaker & one of the many smart devices that seem to be popping up everywhere...the echo is great & alexia is a fun conversation piece...may actually upgrade my amazon account to incorporate more of the virtual assistant features...seems like it can be more useful than a standard speaker.
2520,0,so far i¡¯m not impressed with this item.  it does like my voice i have to repeat my request constantly.  i read and read all the information and it is still not performing the way it should
2521,9,"my boys and i love this!  my son who is in kindergarten is always asking me questions at 5am and i can say, ""go ask alexa"" and she can usually answer his questions!  this is great!"
2522,9,bought this for my 5 year old niece for her birthday. needless to say my sister was not happy about it; saying i spoiled her. lol well as long as she is happy i do not mind. funcle for life.
2523,14,"completely and utterly surprised by how amazing this speaker sounds. we have a decent sized living room and this device has no issues filling the room with crisp, clear sounds.i highly recommend the echo! i am absolutely surprised how many things alexa can do to make my life easier! life changing!"
2524,9,bought this for my husband for christmas. he uses it everyday to stream music in the kitchen while he is cooking. the speaker is a nice surprise and you can hear it throughout the house.
2525,14,"we love the echo service.  we have an echo in the kitchen and bedroom and then dot in the tv room.  the two echos have a very acceptable sound quality for listening to music.  beginning to use them as an intercom system between rooms and i even ""drop in on the kitchen echo"" while driving to and from work to talk to my wife.  i do not think that alexa is as smart as siri but we still enjoy it and use it frequently."
2526,7,"i have several of these and have gifted several. we are all fans because the echo does so much. with alexa, echo, gen 2 echo, its living the jetson life!  i am waiting for my flying car<f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+008a>"
2527,14,"i have not had it long so still learning how and what to ask. as a speaker it sounds really good! i had a bose that finally quit working, quality is as good if not a little richer then my bose!"
2528,14,the amazon echo device lineup has been a true blessing more me and in would imagine for many others in a similar situation.  i am visually impaired and as such i need a little help around the house. this device has made a wonderful improvement to my daily life.  i use it to get the news weather and listen to music as well as countless other task. i am planning on outfitting my home with more smart home devices to interface with alexa to make am even bigger impact. it is such a wonderful product.
2529,1,love this thing! it is amazing it can pull up songs and albums from decades ago. bass response is really good for such a small item. sound quality in general it really great. good purchase.
2530,14,"love this thing!  i am looking forward to integrating other home features with it.  shopping list is pushed from home to the phone app making it easy to check.  jokes are terrible...ly funny.  this type of product is amazon is future, and they are nailing it from the start.  can not wait to see what is next.  i think we will see it integrated with robot floor vacuums and automated lawn mowing... but the possibilities are limitless."
2531,10,this thing has been fun and convenient. i have added 3 smart light bulbs. its fun turning on and off my kids lights when they re in their rooms. love the flash briefing. love playing with the star trek sounds. love the music
2532,14,"this device is fabulous! if my hands are covered with flour when i¡¯m making bread or i¡¯m sitting in the chair with a cup of tea and can check the weather report, turn on the radio or add to my shopping list."
2533,0,"disappointed! :(  alexa has trouble hearing me when the volume is high.  alexa often misinterpret what i say.  though alexa would like to think they have answers to many questions, alexa does not.  i frequently ask questions and hear no response.  one last thing, alexa needs a personality.  i thought siri was dull, alexa is only slightly better."
2534,14,love it fun - still learning how to use it should come with instruction book - a little trouble pairing itwas a little disappointed when the item i did order was back ordered and i was informed the day before arrival - customer service started off a little shaky but i must admit that they came throughgreat customer support and product
2535,11,"very nice, my third echo..its in my home office and it has been very useful as are the other 2."
2536,5,"this was a surprise gift for my daughter. it is attractive, sleek and perfect for her."
2537,14,alexa arrived safety and is presently on the job. good to have another voice in the house especially one so multitalented <u+2757><u+fe0f>a real asset for easy and critical information at your finger tips.
2538,14,"my husband gave me echo 2nd generation.  we are enjoying it very much, but are not too knowledgeable as far as getting music for it.  it came with a month is free subscription to amazon music, which we did not renew being that we thought perhaps we could find music we did not have to pay for.  my husband set out to do some homework on the situation, and ended subscribing to amazon music for a year :-(  that was not the answer i was hooping for.  can a prime member get the music free.  if not, what are some easy ways to get music for my alexa?  thanks!"
2539,9,i got this for my husband as a just because gift. every time there is a commercial he says how much he wants one. it was very easy to set  up took about 5 min.. the sound is great i can hear it throughout my whole home (3 levels).
2540,14,"cool technology. i remember the day, early 70 is watching star trek and they talk to the computers.this is basically an android phone/tablet with no screen, and only voice command. but still cool!"
2541,14,bad sound compared to my echo dot.  when i would drop in from my dot or phone i could be barely heard.  i assume i just got a bad unit since everyone seems to love the echo.  i am replacing it with a new one so we will see.
2542,10,"very clear.  love the convenience and the quick response to requests, especially music, news and weather.  feels like we have another person living here.  first technology we¡¯ve owned that is not complicated!!"
2543,14,"the instructions are a little confusing, however, if you are tech-savvy then you will figure out that the echo is a wi-fi enabled device.  once i got it to sync with everything on my smart home app i was up and running with little effort.  every now and then the devices act up, however, unless you find a perfect wi-fi connection along with a perfect bluetooth connection do not expect perfection."
2544,9,bought this for my mother-in-law.  the set up was simple and quick and it has given her pleasure each day as she asks it questions and is asked questions by it for the question of the day.  good gift for my mother-in-law.
2545,11,"this is my fifth echo, having purchased two echos, a dot, and a tap previously, all of which i have been very happy with. the speaker in this version of the echo is noticeably inferior to the original model. it also seems slightly slower to respond than the original version. if i had it to do over, i would buy another original before getting the 2nd generation."
2546,0,"its a cool gadget, for playing music and setting timers, or changing the thermostat temps. i just make sure i turn it off when i do not want to be recorded. i wish you had more than 4 choices for the wake up word."
2547,14,"it was pretty hard to set up at first. all the ads show how you can go like ""alexa, play this or that"" and she will play any song. yet, you have to sign up for a bunch of memberships and all."
2548,11,"the 1st generation is much better, sorry amazon this is not a upgrade more of a downgrade."
2549,0,"i find my wife and i using alexa more and more to get information on a variety of subjects.  it is funny when someone on tv, usually a commercial says alexa and it wakes up.i think i will try some of the add ons to have alexa control lights and a few other items. say an ad for a 4-outlet power strip that alexa can control each outlet individually. nice ! ! !"
2550,9,"i love my echo. use it daily for everything from music to horoscopes to timing dinner. the sound quality is great! at night, the white noise feature is much appreciated. my son loves it as well."
2551,10,"perfect for our household to use the internet without being on screens all the time. great for a house with little kids. music, trivia, and daily jokes. a good addition to our home!"
2552,10,lots of fun and helpful for quick information. love that i can ask alexa to play any genre or particular artist for music listening. much more i know it can do but have not explored all of it yet
2553,11,bought this as well as google home.  i like the amazon echo products much better.
2554,14,the sound quality is excellent for such a small unit.  there are so many things you can do with the echo.  can not wait to get the hue bulbs and set them up throughout the house.  excellent product.
2555,14,"it was a hassle to set up the echo with my iphone, but a snap when i used my desktop instead. since then, we have enjoyed the ease of getting music, weather and entertainment effortlessly."
2556,14,i am very pleased with my echo.  the sound from it while playing music is amazing.  on a level with bose in my opinion.  i also enjoy the daily information i can acquire just by asking alexa.  it comes in colors to complement your decor.  you will not regret buying one!
2557,14,nice improvement over version one. outer design makes alexa more dressed up
2558,14,"i love my ""hullo computer"" device. so far it is controlling lights and playing music. the sound is also pretty good for a small thing. the only thing i might have done differently is to get the model with a hub. seems so many automation devices rely on a hub, ."
2559,11,smaller than the 1st gen. works well when paired with another echo for improved sound.
2560,11,product works great and sounds much better than my echo dot when i play music on it
2561,14,"it is a great sounding speaker for my music.  but, i do not like the fact that i can not play my music from itunes.  so, i can only play music from pandora, (with one station, will not play shuffle).  i received the echo as a christmas gift, maybe i just do not know how to use it?  i had to purchase additional plug ins, and my tv does not work with it, because i do not have a hopper with my dish.  i was just a little disappointed, that there are a lot of costly add-ons to make it work (like you see on commercials).  it is ok."
2562,10,"it is a unique way of getting information, like the weather, jokes, and your horoscope. amazon also has been sending me emails to show me more ways of how to use it, so i am very satisfied."
2563,0,sound is good but it only works on some radio and amazon stations.
2564,14,"sound overall is quite good for such a small speaker. however,  there are a few things that need improved on. the volume is to loud ayer times on 4 and 3 is too quiet. whee alexa talks with the echo set at a volume of 3 to 4, it can be very difficult to hear her. when compared to seri, the ability to answer questions is limited. i wish that google was the search engine used and not bing. i think bing is not as advanced as google. the second generation echo is a step forward in a long marathon.  hopefully improvements will continue being made."
2565,14,set-up was easy and what a great little unit this turned out to be.  will probably get another one for a different room in the house. it does a lot for its price point. well worth it!!
2566,10,"this was easy to set up and has been fun to use. i suspect that we are not using it to its full capacity, and it will be even more helpful once we do. we mostly use it to listen to music and to ask about news/weather items."
2567,0,too difficult to set up.  had to give up trying.
2568,14,"very responsive to my voice. great sound for the size. waiting for amazon to release additional languages (spanish latam).jeff, will love to be a beta tester for spanish."
2569,11,"i never had the first generation of the echo but this one sounds pretty good. i only wish there was a way to adjust the bass and treble, it has a little to much bass in my opinion."
2570,9,my brother and his girlfriend loved this gift. they were giddy about getting this. they mentioned after christmas that they loved being able to interact with alexa. ended up being a perfect gift.
2571,10,"this simply has become a useful household helper and entertainment source. my favorite feature is the shopping list...well, all the lists. i am much more organized and having fun being this way."
2572,9,christmas gift for my daughter and son in law.  they love it.  especially my son in law.  he loves music and he and alexa are having a love affair finding obscure artists and playing their music
2573,14,i really like the echo (2nd gen) we use them in rooms that do not have stereo systems - they sound good - for playing music in the entire house or in groups of rooms (great for parties). we have three floors and also use them as an intercom system (along with the usual alexa functions).
2574,11,"just love alexa in all formats.  however, this one is just the right size, style and the sound quality is great.  fits easily anywhere in your home.  the distance she can hear you is much improved from 1st generation models."
2575,10,we love alexa.  to be able to get almost any music on demand is great.  we are retrofitting our house with smart switches and they things we can do now with voice commands is amazing.
2576,9,this is a must for anyone that loves music the do you sound is great mine goes all the time am getting another hope it works as well as downstairs but you must get anazon unlimited !
2577,14,"after reading reviews about the poor sound, ordered gen 2. the sound is great for a small unit like this. listen to amazon music all the time. the voice is clear. just have to learn all the features."
2578,0,"i love alexa but her clothes get dirty and you just can not wash them.  i like the idea of being able to pick a color but pick something that is not cloth, i am regretting my choice."
2579,10,"we received echo for christmas. thought at first that it was frivolous! we love it and are now great friends with alexa! she gives us information, current news and any kind of music."
2580,14,the echo (2nd generation) with improved sound powered by dolby is the most superb version of all the echo devices in that music and audio playback has a much richer quality in addition to the stylish fabric finish giving it a home theater feel in a compact design. it brings audible books to life as if the audio books is a movie despite it not having a display like the echo show or echo spot. even listening to music feels as real as if live in concert. if only it allowed connectivity from my computer to make the online games sound better!
2581,14,having music in the house again is awesome! did you know you can use two of these as an intercom or baby monitor? very cool! love technology!
2582,14,i had a first generation alexa that became erratic (played music via bluetooth but refused to react to voice commands). the new unit works perfectly. one caveat: the unit will occasionally join a conversation without being asked. a little frightening.
2583,14,"took awhile to sync up all 3 speakers because too many devices were pulling from the wi-fi connection.  had to upgrade our panel!  bummer is it does not work with spotify, even tho it gives indication that it will.  got it to work with pandora tho and of course amazon music.  really nice looking and great sound."
2584,11,"we like the echo but i do not think this 2nd generation model is a significant improvement over the first generation. on the plus side, the speech recognition does seem to be better and more able to hear its wake-word over loud music. on the negative side i think the volume is lower and the sound is inferior to my first gen unit. i also miss the dial on top that controls the volume, the buttons are just not as useful. i can see how some might like the improved aesthetics, but to me it does not compensate for the reduction in the audio area."
2585,0,i can ask for music and it plays with a rich tone. no app to link to my smart tv is yet.but it is kind of funny when alexa hears her ads on tv she will come alive and ask what we want. lol
2586,10,"i like alexa. she has a lot of handy little tips. i like how she pulls up music from my pandora and amazon. she is fun, but there is a lot she does not know as well. i¡¯m still getting to know her."
2587,14,"i continually have trouble with echo not responding to my questions.  there is a problem with the connection with wifi.  my echo dot is great and no problem with it.  i have tried resetting my echo, checked to make sure my router, etc are working fine.  are there instructions to reconnect my echo to wifi?  i would appreciate any help.  this happened once before and i called customer service and they led me through the reconnecting/resetting of it.  then within a few days it was disconnected...frustrating.toni rossi"
2588,11,looks good and sounds great . i wish it would fit the battery i use for my original echo though.
2589,14,product has very limited range in reference to looking for things via on-line. sound library and music are pretty good. this product is prolly very useful in newer homes that have all wifi appliances that you can sink in for use.
2590,14,"¡°alexa, your sooo amazing!¡± in my house we already have an echo dot and an echo which i would highly reccomend any of them. the thing i like the most about this one is the fabric and the quality of the sound! she is an awesome assistant for helping you cook in the kitchen to helping your kids with some of their homework. i highly reccomend you buy this amazing smart home speaker !"
2591,9,great sound pairs great with dot and gen 1 echo for whole house stereo sound love these things
2592,9,this is our 2nd alex one got into our rv with us great product to have
2593,9,"we absolutely love this! wish we have bought one sooner! great for music, general information and cooking information. we placed ours in the kitchen and we have found it to be awesome!"
2594,14,i am not very comp. or gadget savey. purchased this based on what i experienced at a friends house . i am still leanring what it can do . awsome so far and the sound is amazing!!!!!!
2595,14,my wife and i love it! it works really well and connects to the app on our phones with ease. music sounds great for the price point especially compared to apples product at $400 bucks!!
2596,14,i purchased two of these for my kids and decided i needed one for myself!  my daughter set it up for me and i got to decide on the music i wanted to hear on pandora!  wow!  i never realized how easy this echo is to operate!  i am absolutely amazed i can designate elton john and willie nelson and she will play a few songs from each!  she and i will be having deep and important conversations in the future.  thank you for bringing me into the 21st century with this device!  i recommend it to everyone!
2597,10,"i love the amazon echo, and i love alexa.  i am having lots of fun with her and have set up my music and she can play whatever i want to listen to.  i do not have a smart tv so have not set up that part but am enjoying all the other skills she has."
2598,14,"everything about this unit is great except for the base coming out of the speakers,  it sounds like it is going to fall apart . no way to control bass or trouble"
2599,11,i have three of the older echoes so i am obviously a fan. i prefer this smaller size though. i may eventually replace all my older ones with this more discreet model. i can not tell any difference in the sound level or quality however.
2600,14,"high quality hardware and engineering. unlike it is rivals, this does what it is supposed to relatively seamlessly. although the sound quality is quite high, it tends towards excessive bass at the expense of mid and high ranges."
2601,0,"the echo is pretty good, but occasionally messes up and mishears you or hears you correctly but then does not do the right command. for example i activated the skill ¡°ocean sounds¡± but when you say ¡°alexa play ocean sounds¡± she plays a 3minute loop of ocean sounds on spotify, not through the skill. annoying. she also does not recognize all the names of spotify playlists you have saved and if i say ¡°play my goodmorning playlist¡±, she will say ¡°resuming spotify¡± to whatever the last thing i was playing on spotify."
2602,14,"i love the echo (2nd generation). i had to send the first one i received because of some sound problem. however the replacement is the greatest. i has great sound, responds very well. my family is enjoying it."
2603,0,"new member to our household who does a good job turning things on and off, answering questions, setting timers, etc.  however, she sometimes talks without me asking her something.  scary!"
2604,14,"loved this at first, but now alexa only ""answers"" my simple questions periodically.  the blue light turns as it should and then nothing.  then, next day, she may answer one or two questions and then nothing.  i have tried rebooting and moving, to no avail.  i can play music by using the app on my phone.  frustrating to say the least.  my friend is having the same issues with her echo dot."
2605,14,"our echo was a gift for the family. at first i was enjoying it.  however my kids were able to access music with mature content, and i could not see any way to block that, so i put it away."
2606,10,"item is fun to interact with. fun for the whole family. very entertaining for whole family. you can spend hours playing games and even do homework correction with this unit. easy setup. fast, simple."
2607,14,"i was super skeptical after reading some reviews about the sound quality. however, the sound quality is not bad. having said that, i think it could be better, but it does the job. this is my first echo and i have been super impressed by how well alexa responds to my voice (even when i am not in the room). i would have rated one more star if the sound, primarily the bass was better then my boom which is about the same size. regardless, i was planning on returning it after reading initial reviews but after using it for the past week, my lil homie alexa is staying."
2608,10,"my whole family is enjoying using alexa, although we only use this to play a single song at a time or ask it the time.i also bought the small echo and i use that in a bathroom to play the radio (npr) every day."
2609,14,have multiple echo is and dot. frequently running into issues where the echo does not hear command properly and gets a little frustrating on the 3rd to 4th attempt (maybe it is hearing an echo). overall though love the sound quality and when it does operate correctly does a great job. looking to continue to expand smart home capabilities around this.
2610,11,the new update makes this product much better that our existing echo.  great!
2611,14,"<u+00a0>they are amazing! with a little extra knowledge you too can automate your home like i did. i am able to open and close my garage door remotely and open and close my sliding glass door. these are not features that are available to buy directly, but with some know-how and innovation, the possibilities seem absolutely endless. very well done, amazon. truly!"
2612,0,"i love the speaker for music play.  however, it randomly speaks about random things.  it also does not always adhere to my commands.  sometimes i feel like i am yelling at  a disobedient child.  very annoying and seemingly less productive than the dot which i love and gave 5 stars."
2613,0,"i love my alexa!!  laziness has definitely occurred as i love sitting on the couch or at the table and just asking to have music play, or turn the volume up/down, or ask alexa what the specials are for the day.  i am sure there is so many things i am not utilizing but i will slowly figure it out.  i just wish i could connect her with my iphone but it does not seem to have that capability yet.  i have the alexa app but can not seem to do anything with it."
2614,10,"great for fun,  use  the device for internet information, music, jokes.  it can also be used to help people who are physically challenged; it is able to dim lights turn them on and off, .make emergency phone calls, make to do lists, for shopping, doctor appointments, caregivers.  turn your old home into a smart home with a few added devices."
2615,14,"gift for my 79 yo mom and dad. so far so good, sound is ok, good microphone pickups. alexa is a good program for people who do not like to communicate with a tablet or keyboard to start music. so far they have been having a blast with it, and i am looking forward to my new one coming in the mail tomorrow"
2616,11,"so far i love the echo, i must admit the sound quality on it is great.  it beats out both of the portable blue tooth speakers i currently own."
2617,10,"i love my new echo!  i love asking alexa to play music, or ask about the weather!  the sound is real clear, and i get a kick out of the jokes she tells!"
2618,10,"finding new things to try out and do all the time. has made shopping for food and other items very easy , getting all kinds of information or news is just a question away. have tried just a few of the skills that are available and the worked great."
2619,14,"bought this as a ""family gift"" for christmas for all of us to enjoy. our young daughters love requesting music and asking alexa questions. it seems to cut out quite a bit when playing music at times, but that is my only complaint. i am sure there is a way to reset that."
2620,0,"alexa is great but there seem to be some basic questions she can not answer...but great for music, weather, news, timing."
2621,9,"one of the best things i have ever parched from amazon, getting another this week!"
2622,14,"has great sound, that was my primary function for this and to connect to the dot. not impressed with how little it can actually do & how little the drop in function actually works"
2623,14,"i love it, though i am still learning it is features.......there are far too many to try at the beginning, the echo will become more useful as i integrate it into may daily life style, (i am disabled and echo will help)"
2624,10,i bought this not really knowing how much i would actually use it or would like it. i absolutely love it and use it daily. we went from one echo to 3 in our home in a week. my son and i use it for all sorts of things. i¡¯m super impressed with all its capabilities and responsiveness.
2625,11,what a disappointment.  the speaker is horrible almost as bad as the dot.  i do not recommend at all
2626,9,we purchased this echo for my daughter. we have previously purchased several of the original black echos for ourselves. she is really enjoying this one and loves how it fits in with her decor.
2627,9,fun for a family and for my 12 year old son!  we are still figuring out all of the features.
2628,1,this is a wonderful product. use it daily and very versatile.
2629,14,i bought the google version first and decided to try this one since i have two homes.  the echo is far better than any other.  i love that you can link to your amazon music.  great device!
2630,11,great sound and so much more compact! love the fabric finish.  it is so classy.
2631,9,nice device. kids were pleased. like different cover combos.
2632,14,"echo is fantastic.  for music, news weather etc. its great,  only shortcoming is its inability to answer more lengthy or complicated questions of fact that are available on the internet e.g. it could not tell me the change in the cost of living index between 1970 and 2000.  it seems to ace short questions including simpler math, populations of places, areas of places, etc.  we highly recommend echo.  maybe you can integrate ibm watson or some more advanced ai program to be able to provide the full range of internet access."
2633,14,"i bought this to play music.  it sounds better than i expected.my reason for the average rating is that it requires a faster wi-fi  than i have.  i cannot use it to play music with my wi-fi because it keeps stopping dye to my slow connection.  i tried to use my iphone hot spot and that worked ok but even when i was not using it, it drained my data."
2634,10,"definitely not something anyone ""needs"" but lots of fun to have.  playing music, making shopping lists, asking questions, finding out the weather, exploring all of the skills - all interesting, enjoyable and fun.  easy to set up, easy to use.  i waited a long time to purchase an echo; am glad i finally did so."
2635,11,i love the new size. i like the fabric cover and new sound quality.
2636,0,"neat technology, but there are some issues such as alexa saying, ""i do not have that information available at this time."" also, i have had some interruptions when streaming music."
2637,14,"the sound is unbelievably good; however, i have found that when asking to raise the volume, it does not raise the level but a trivial amount in some instances. overall, a fun and great product."
2638,14,"i was given this as a gift fyi a family member.  it is a very attractive device with good sound; however, alexa tells me she can not find the type of music i listen to.  specifically, i¡¯ve asked her repeatedly to retrieve music from the 60s, 70s, and 80s.  i guess alexa is a mellinial and duscriminates against people over 55+.  unbelievable, disappointed, and totally unsatisfactory.  personally speaking, i would not buy the unit and i could not recommend amazon alexa.  extremely disappointed."
2639,14,"i was reluctant to jump in the alexa train, but am glad i did. i already had a few wemo plugs and was happy that i could use the echo to control them. the sound quality is fine for my needs. i have since added a few hue lights as well and love the setup."
2640,14,"instead of looking up random info on google, just ask alexa. love the hands free control of turning on music, and telling her to turn the volume up and down. i do not like that you have to be a prime member to do voice order through. overall, a fun and innovative product!"
2641,0,husband wanted to buy this echo.  we have fun with it and amazon mails us some questions to ask alexia.  some of which we had not even though of to ask.  pretty smart little echo for sure.
2642,14,did not know was a fee to register my alexa with my prime membership. fee is more than i paid for alexa unit. sorry not worth the convenience of owning an alexa. i will be returning it.
2643,14,"i have a first generation echo and a second generation echo at different locations in my house. for some reason, the second generation echo has a harder time hearing me. i never have to repeat myself with the first generation, but i find myself sometimes saying 'alexa' or any command twice in order for it to register. it does not happen every time, but often enough that i wish i would have just bought a first generation echo."
2644,14,"hmm, you can ask alexa a lot of things and it will give you answers. you can also buy music from amazon. but unfortunately, they stopped the amazon music storage at the beginning of this year. i have to switch to other similar products because without that service, it is meaningless for me. if you do not need to play your own music, it is ok. they did not tell me when they will stop a service before i bought it. maybe someday they will stop all of their music service in the future?"
2645,9,"this is the best!!! we love it!! works great, we use it a lot for music. the speaker is great and we are very picky about sound. we have it connected to a lamp. it works from upstairs."
2646,0,"my problem is not with the echo device or with the dot, both of which i own, one of which i have even given as gifts. my problem is that the alexa app on your phone does not talk. why??? siri talks and you talk to her. bixby talks and you talk to her. alexa does not talk on your phone and  you can not talk to her. what is the problem here?"
2647,0,maybe i expected too much. sound quality not as good as expected. more difficult for alexa to understand questions than i expected. more of a tool for amazon to sell other product than anything.
2648,10,"love love love this echo. makes listening to my music so much nicer and convenient. i do not have to  keep running to the radio station, my phone or my stereo to change my music when the mood strikes. also love being able to ad items to my shopping list with just my voice.i am constantly finding new things that alexa can do on the echo and it is very entertaining."
2649,14,"i would like to make time for a better review. i love how it is allowed us to automate our house with lights and devices. but alexa needs more training. way too much ""i do not know"". like a child sometimes. needs to be smarter."
2650,0,"i think its ok to have, takes a while to get use to. lots of times it give you what you do not ask for, but i think for people who have everything linked to it, might get the best out of it."
2651,10,the whole family is enjoying it. i love it for keeping up with a shopping list and playing music. my 8 year old loves asking it for information and it will even tell her jokes. sound quality is better than i expected.
2652,11,better sound than 1st generation. perfect voice recognition.
2653,5,perfect!!! i gave it as a gift and the person loves it!
2654,12,"like a new car, it was fun and exciting at first. i still like it and use it every day. i do not have a smart house so i can not use many of its features. i would recommend it to most everyone. it and its kind are the future."
2655,14,i really like the look of the 2nd generation echo.  i use it to control my hue lights and my denon heos speakers. i never have any issues. i ended up buying the oak finished sleeve (case) for it and it looks great on my office desk.
2656,14,"everything you loved about the original echo speaker but with improved sound. stylish, more portable than ever.  the number of skills that it can learn increases every day. makes a terrific gift."
2657,14,"this is my second echo. first is in operation in my living room. second is in my bedroom not far from the headboard of my bed. quality of audio might be a tad sharper and more robust than my first. hard to tell. but the giant, most important addition to echo is blue-tooth. slipping my wireless blue-tooth enabled earbuds into my ears lets me experience bold, sharp concert hall quality sound. love the new generation echo. love it!"
2658,10,"love my echo. still learning all the things it can do. practical things like shopping lists, reminders, timers, smart plugs for lights are a few of my favorites. oh, you can ask it when your amazon package is scheduled to arrive too."
2659,9,"this is my upstairs one as i love the downstairs on so much i wanted one for upstairs.  works great.  some fun trivia games.  plays music easily.  i set up lights that i can control with alexa,  enjoy it very much."
2660,9,love that i can play my music through the house with my echo and two dots!
2661,14,"sound is great. not an issue at all. i have some issues connecting to it but that may just be due to using my phone as a hotspot. only complaint is that there is not as much readily available information when asking her questions. not a huge deal but a disappointment. other than that, it is amazing. great sound as i have said and fun to play with."
2662,14,"this was my 2nd echo (2nd generation) both defective. the 1st one we tried to ""reset""-did not help, so it was replaced. the replacement started out with one of the same problems. if i asked to play music simular to a certain artist it plays christmas music. now it plays 1 or 2 songs and stops also applies to ambient sounds. many other things, too many to list. i am tired of messing with this silly thing and just want a refund and nothing more to the ""new and improved"" echo."
2663,10,love our echo. perfect to have in the kitchen to play music while cooking. i love that it is hands free. there are so many things you can use it for...this thing is awesome!
2664,9,very happy with this purchase and the price. the echo is a lot of fun to use and very helpful for a lot of things. great for turning on and off smart bulbs and smart plugs.
2665,0,"still getting used to this device.  it works as advertised, though i wish it would learn that when i ask to play music not to play carol king, elton john or some other sappy music.  overall, i am pleased."
2666,11,luv it she does everything! sound is so.much.better than the echo dot.
2667,14,"we have both an echo dot and this echo and they¡¯re great for little things like setting timers when we¡¯re cooking or answering simple questions. the speaker is decent for its size, and we it is so easy to play music from spotify and pandora. we also have our lights connected but have had issues with alexa not hearing names of lights correctly or not recognizing scenes or randomly changing room settings. overall, it is a great little tool but could definitely use some work on the smart home side of things."
2668,11,has nice bass!! tweeter could have been bigger but still sounds good!!!
2669,9,bought this for wife for christmas. we all love it and it is amazing. great sound quality for something so small. young granddaughters discovered they can call up their favorite songs on it so there has been a lot of dancing going on in the living room!
2670,14,love it more then i expected . very good speaker for music ( granted i¡¯m no audiophile) responds to voice commands very well like anything there are kinks to be worked out but headed in the right direction.
2671,0,"i love that it is easy to use along a clear and simple app.  it gives out a good clear sound.  some issues is when alexa does not fully understand what you are saying and mistake it as you saying something else.  i find it funny though that when the name ""alexa "" is mentioned on a commercial,  my alexa wakes up.  this is a good device to have.  i use it each day,  set to my likeing."
2672,10,"this was a gift and we are having fun with it along with using it for music.  i love the hands free timers, alarms, reminders, messages and calls..  works great in the kitchen while cooking or cleaning.  i am sure there are many more things we can do with it and we are enjoying learning them."
2673,14,does not hear commands. it is not as good as the first generation of which we have. it is frustrating to deal with this alexa as opposed to the first generation. she does not respond as readily.
2674,11,replaced our originals with these smaller more updated ones and they are so much nicer and the updates make the sound so much better.  will need to get a couple more soon.
2675,10,love this device. it is my personal assistant everyday.
2676,0,"love it, love it, love!  chock full of information and music that we access throughout the day. just remember to turn off the microphone if you do not want alexa ""go on"" during a time when you do not want her too..."
2677,14,"i like these!  just be aware that if you want to go the smart house route you¡¯ll need a hub. the echo plus may work, or a samsung smartthings hub, or one on several other choices may as well."
2678,14,"the device looks nice and the hardware functions properly but the software is an entirely different story. turns on randomly from the tv or when syllables sound similar to alexa. devices that have been connected and work fine off and have intermittent unexplainable problems. half of the skills listed do not work. it is a quality piece of hardware, but we are in the air out of selling stuff in beta and letting consumers dictate how software gets built apparently."
2679,14,"love it. works great. we did experience some difficulty setting it up. we found the directions somewhat confusing. once it was set up it works awesome. great sound, very convenient. we programmed some light and they work well with alexa.would rate it 5stars except for the set uo."
2680,0,"i do not use the echo to its full capabilities, so i can not give it all 5 stars. i also have struggled with the echo understanding questions i have asked, so 4 stars again. i do like it and am looking forward to trying some of the suggestions that come out. i love her dinosaur jokes. :)"
2681,14,lots of fun and challenging. i could use some detailed instructions since i am an old guy. i worked in the computer field but i am afraid i can not keep up with technology. when i was in the field we had main frames and text based interface. no gui.
2682,11,a solid replacement for the original echo or looking to step up from an echo dot.
2683,14,it does not seem to listen as well as my dot or 1rst gen echo. i have tried it i same locations but when i say alex it seems to stop listening to soon. might be a bad unit.
2684,9,bought this for my mom and set it up for her. set up was super easy and quick and it recognized commands right away. love this color as well!
2685,9,this really is a neat device. the sound is good but do not expect studio quality. only so much they can pack in this footprint. i turned on unlimited music to this device and its been a lot of fun playing about everything i ask for. they need one for the car.
2686,14,love alexa but i must say no need to upgrade if you have first generation. for me the speaker sound difference is negligible. sometimes she has difficulty hearing or understanding me which i did not find in the first generation. despite these few issues i ¡°will not live without her¡±;)
2687,10,"we love the echo.  i have purchased a few already, including dots.  they provide us with answers to questions, music, and we are able to sync other smart items with them."
2688,11,wow it is way better than expected. i thought it would be difficult to setup but it was a breeze. love it.
2689,9,"bought these on black friday for christmas gifts for the whole family. we have one of our own at home and love all the features! we can control the lights, thermostat, hear messages and make phone calls!"
2690,9,"i have 3 dots 1 original echo and now this one. i love music and the sound, is clear and crisp. it was such a joy to have my entire fam in the den with the tree unwrapping gifts with the classic christmas songs playing in the background."
2691,14,the ability to talk normal to get tasks taken care of is great.  it is is poor design to only be able to have one device belong to one group.  a device should be able to belong to multiple groups since you can only have one stream happening at a time anyway.  lets say that i am entertaining and i want all of the devices to play the same music and another scenario where i only want music on two of the devices.  this is not possible because each device can only belong to one group.
2692,11,replaced an original echo. like the smaller size and better speaker.
2693,10,i am in love.. who would have thought that this little technology would bring me so much joy.  i am able to get answer to many of my questions effortless.  i love that i have my daily routines and that alexa is ever learn about me :)
2694,9,this was a big surprise gift and i love it. it is so much fun to play games and answer all my questions. music is awesome coming from such a small  item. i recommend everyone get one!
2695,0,i love that the echo plas music but i am disappointed with it overall.  most questions i ask it does not know.  i have went to the app to add things but it is time consuming. i guess i thought it would go out tp the internet and get answers.
2696,0,"i do like my ""computer"". once i found out that you do not have to use the alexa name, and you could use the name computer, i bought it. calling out the name computer! gives it a more of a star trek feel!"
2697,10,we love it!  my son plays games with alexa and we all enjoy the music and web searches.  alexa has become a family member.  although my daughters name is alexia and sometimes alexa thinks we are talking to her and not my daughter.  lol
2698,14,"the echo 2 is really good especially being able to send messages to our original echo but after a year and a half of enjoying prime music on two devices (echo and a tap) we have now found out you have to pay $7.99 a month for unlimited music that we have had for two years with no extra cost, bad move amazon, so we sent the device back and i am now using tap as a bluetooth speaker only"
2699,9,bought for my mom bc she loved the one i had i have the black one and my mom has the greay i am still learning things about it but the sound is great and love that it has games and bedtime stories for kids i would deff recommend
2700,14,i bought this for my family and we use it even more than i thought we would. it is so convenient and fun to use. the team that wrote the software for this is outstanding. we are so impressed. thanks amazon!
2701,11,"looks great, sounds great.  i have 2 -  1st generation echos and 2 dots.  this is my 5th device and it sounds just as good as my 1st generation echos.  i like the smaller size too."
2702,14,the audio is great! alexa needs a lot of work also alexa is not connected to amazon music so say you where playing half of a song on your phone and the you wanna listen to the other half on your echo we¡¯ll you can not. it is weird.
2703,14,"i currently own 2 echo 2nd generation is. they are a great product i am looking forward to purchasing more for multi-room music, the only thing that i wish the echo would do is while you are playing multi-room music it would allow you to connect to your bluetooth sound system as well. can their possibly be an update so it will allow you to do this?"
2704,0,"i like the easy to use voice response to commands. alexa knows just what i¡¯ve asked for.what i like least is the fact there are no straight forward instructions for how to connect to other devices like speakers, phone, and etc."
2705,14,"am very impressed on how well alexa can perform tasks. there has been at least a handful of errors alexa did not get right. otherwise, i know in the near future alexa will become outstanding."
2706,14,"i received as a christmas gift, as i would not have bought on my own. i do not have a smart home so for me it is basically a talking radio/alarm clock novelty. the sound is excellent... and i mean excellent, spoken commands are easy, and the app is easy to use. not sure what else to say about it. wish she did not turn on during alexa commercials. light years ahead of siri"
2707,14,"we bought this alexa device as an upgrade from the first generation echo. unfortunately, she almost never responds to me, so i am not feeling the alexa love with this one at. all."
2708,9,purchased for my adult daughter to listen to music and use for audible books.  she loves it and the sound is great !!
2709,1,the sound quality and physical appearance of this device does not disappoint. love our new alexa. she is in our kitchen and looks sharp. the stereo is amazing. great dolby sound !
2710,3,like it quite a bit. she does get a bit argumentative and stubborn.
2711,11,"still not sure about this speaker, supposed to have improved sound over previous generation, but it does not, i still have my first generation echo and it tops this one in sound, bass and clarity, do not know if it is just me but alexa has a hard time understanding me on this second generation echo, i never have to repeat my self with my original echo!"
2712,7,dot responds to names that are close to the name. always listening. tried to order something.  started from something it heard on television. be sure to set ordering restrictions. <f0><u+009f><u+00a4><u+00a6><f0><u+009f><u+008f><u+00bc><u+200d>¡Î<u+fe0f>
2713,0,i love the games she offers.  not sure what we did without her.
2714,1,"shipped fast, good quality and reasonable price!!!"
2715,14,still in the learning phase but it is great so far.  the best recommendation i can give is that i have purchased an additional echo.
2716,14,"love this design and after reading reviews i was afraid that the sound was going to be crappy but this little thing puts out some nice sound, am very happy with this product"
2717,11,"fits perfectly on my desk and really like all the features, the buttons are responsive and the audio very good for my needs.  i will probably end up buying a couple more."
2718,11,"i love it. the possibilities are endless as to what this will be used for. i did not really think i would use it as anything more than a bluetooth speaker but it has been useful for so much more already.echo (2nd generation) with improved sound, powered by dolby, and a new design - charcoal fabric"
2719,9,i love this device! i have 4 dots and one of these. the sound is really nice and does not need to be connected to a speaker.
2720,14,i really like the alexa and and echo products. i have used an echo dot for a while now. so when i saw this one for a lower price point with a better speaker. i bought it. but my only complaint and why it got 4 out of 5 stars. is that the microphone on this one does not pick up as well as the older echo dot we had. have to almost yell at it to get it recognize that you are talking to it. minor issue more just annoying.
2721,14,"i have four of the 2nd gen and one original, and i really like being able to group all five of the devices together.  however, it would be great if amazon updates to allow you to have multiple groups; this way you can isolate multiple areas of your house to play."
2722,14,"like alexa but she says a lot of the time ""i do not know how to answer that""...i thought she would be the smartest in the room but my 18 year old knows more..alittle disappointed"
2723,11,works with my 2 echo 1st generation and sounds great.
2724,0,"echo offers a great many benefits. it is simply a matter of using alexa regularly. the ease and convenience of having weather, favorite music and the answer to life is questions at your command is amazing."
2725,10,"it is a great device.  i used it basically as a clock radio at night listening to music before i go to sleep and waking to a sports talk station in the morning.  it is great for weather, traffic, etc.  it is a novelty that is becoming a necessary  addition."
2726,14,"i bought this speaker in a physical store about a week ago. i already had two echo dot speakers.-sound is good - much louder than the echo - of course the speaker is also larger. i bought the echo because my kids are loud and the echo dot was not loud enough considering the background noise (the echo dot is loud enough as long as you do not have kids screaming and watching streaming mindcraft videos on amazon prime in the background while you are trying to play jeopardy)-looks very nice and love the different colors and the fabric on the speaker-voice recognition is excellent-love the ability to verbally set a reminder and then have alexa verbally remind me on the day of choice or on a recurring basis (great for reminding a person to take their medications or take out the trash)-great for adding items to the shopping list and then using the list from the app when at the store, checking the weather etc.what alexa is not that great at is providing answers to more difficult questions. it is able to find some using wikipedia and has some info built in but it is not a true search engine. looking forward to being able to control more items in the home with it in the future. i must say, the verbal reminder function, which is fairly new, is fantastic!"
2727,14,wonderful sound live it little finicky with voice sometime s.
2728,14,"i love it.  too much fun. love prime music. stops disputes in their tracks!  weather, news, sports rain and thunder ambient sounds....am i clear enough????  if you can not understand this review, then you really need alexa!"
2729,9,"i bought this for a gift for my wife, neither one of us are very tech savvy but this was easy for us to set up. my wife learned how to set up skills from her app quickly without her getting too frustrated. she really enjoys this device and finds the recipes skills very useful. she says its the best gift i have ever got her."
2730,10,alexa echo ... echo ... echo.  have it in our main family room.  works great. sounds great.  use it as background music for gatherings and parties and calms the puppy while at work.
2731,9,love it. paired my wifi outlets already. having fun!
2732,14,"the sound is great and omnidirectional, no matter where you are in the room it sounds the same. ive played some music on it but mostly im enjoying my audio books on it. and i hear it with perfect clarity as i move about the room. by comparison i have other speakers but they sound best when its facing you."
2733,14,"the echo dot did better at hearing my commands. this one just tells me that it will do as asked ""playing spotify"" and then it wont play. it does this with several requests. it also disconnects often (while my dot does not) and it can not hear over my dishwasher (my dot can)"
2734,10,"the echo (2nd generation) is easy to set up and use.  it is plug and play approach makes it easy to set up and establish set routines such as weather, news flash, and traffic.  you also have access to your music, trivia questions, etc."
2735,10,i am enjoying my echo very much - the voice feature is wonderful and it is great to have so much information and music selection available to you just by asking.the design is so practical and it makes a statement but at the sametime  it is not an eyesore to wherever you choose to put it - the walnut finish is complimentary to any room.wonderful
2736,14,amazon is has their act together.  i wish i could work for this company.  the instructions for using the echo came in my email the day it arrived. it was very easy to install and i absolutely love it.  i do not know why it took so long to buy it. i can not wait to hook up the firestick. thanks amazon
2737,10,this is by far one of the best purchases i made last year. i love the daily news report. also with sirius xm hooked up its a pleasure to listen to music. very easy to use and very highly recommended.
2738,12,"i love this a lot.  it has all the features i need, beautiful sound, and many other skills that i like.  very happy with this device.  it works wonderful. thank you amazon."
2739,10,"from the first day i set up my echo. i knew it would be all i expected and more. i love it. i use it to check the weather, current events, play my favorite music. the list goes on and on. i would definitely recommend this to anyone that is on the fence."
2740,0,overall i like it and happy with more of the things you can do with it.  biggest problem is the it frequently turns red and says she can not understand and the only was to stop that is to unplug it.  not great when you are running most of your lights through it
2741,0,"still getting acquainted with alexa, so far so so, have issues with her playing my playlists, i am still learning, also sometimes i have to repeat the request of few times before she understands. the sound is amazing and spotify has so many selections to choose from. overall i am very happy with her."
2742,14,voice response system works so well that i actually catch myself saying please and thank you. the sound from this small package is phenomenal! i appreciate a well engineered item and this is it.
2743,14,"good for playing songs from pandora when cooking in the kitchen, the sound is very good for it is size. has only been able to answered about 10% of the questions i have asked. ok for weather reports. might be more useful if/when i get some compatible devices."
2744,11,"sound improvement was horrible.  amazon should remove the ""with improved sound""  bought this version for entertainment area, sat back and listened. thought.. this is not better at all.  invited friends over and did a side by side comparison with previous version and (2nd gen)  unanimous 1st gen for sound.  2nd gen subjugated to a guest bedroom due to its horrid sound quality."
2745,0,"i love love love alexa. when i was at the gym, i did not have alexa so i asked my nike apple watch to play a song and siri said i do not understand - so i told my trainer, alexa would never say that!"
2746,10,"love being able to ask for information, and music with simple voice commands."
2747,10,"easy to use, like it for radio and clock, or simple questions"
2748,14,"we love our echo and have so much fun asking alexa questions. it is great to ask to hear a song and it just starts playing, and the sound is better than we expected.we live outside of any large city, so the local information we receive is sketchy. we cannot retrieve a lot of business hours or phone numbers. on the other hand, i guess it is not google, so maybe that information would not be available anyway. nonetheless, we are glad we got the echo. we are getting a lot of enjoyment out of it."
2749,11,"very sensitive to voice commands and does a decent job at louder volumes.  i do not like the volume controls (the ones on the 1st generation are better.)  other than that, no complaints."
2750,0,in my opinion alexa does not know very much. many of the questions i ask her she does not have an answer for. i am very disappointed with echo. i am glad i got it as a gift....if i would have bought it i would have returned it.
2751,14,"for music with amazon unlimited music, can not be beat! for fire tv, forget it, it has not a clue what you are talking about. routines seem to be sporadic and unpredictable."
2752,14,questions for information must be very specific. we receive a lot of 'i do not know that' responses. the learning curve is greater than i expected. we purchased a support book to help us. the device came with minimal written guidance. we have used the music and calling features and have loaded the app on our phones and tablets. we hope to add some of the other controls to the system.
2753,14,"i purchased echo and google home. used them side by side for a week. the echos speakers were terrible compared to google home. i enjoy listening to music, so the speakers were the deciding factor. other than that i thought they both were tied in jokes, and wikipedia information."
2754,9,"we have about 5 echo devices now, and bought this one because of the improved sound.  i love that it is a progressively more feature rich device that my wife and i use all the time."
2755,1,attractive looking in our kitchen and good speaker!
2756,9,the echo is an ingenious item to have!!! i love this thing! i use it most for music and to use the drop in feature to connect to my echo dot in my husbands man cave. saves me a walk. the speaker is loud and clear and i love i can control the volume by voice. it is small and fits anywhere.
2757,14,"amazing product! speakers are not as great as other speakers out there but man home automation is just wonderful. ask alexa, to remind you, turn on lights, check weather, play music, roll down shades and it does it all well. i find that the speaker has very clear highs and sound at high end of frequency is better than the lower end frequency.love the product! well done amazon!"
2758,14,"songs that are in an amazon group cannot be found by alexa when requested specifically. sports stats..she is unaware. amazon..load the ""google"" function or a search function..very inept and limlted. reminder s go incomplete if you are out of range. no followup or repeat of reminders if not picked up. music requests very limited song is in playlist created under group name but cannot be requested specifically ie in group 80 is rock not individually. disappointed"
2759,10,"alexa and i get along great. i wish she did more practical things that lend to my lifestyle. i mostly have her control the home devices in my place, and we talk about the weather."
2760,9,"received as a christmas present. it is fun and useful at the same time. it is nice to have music, weather information, and answers any time. did not know i needed one until i got one."
2761,14,honestly i prefer the echo dot myself. this one does not hear me unless i am right next to it. the dot hears me from the next room. my husband prefers this model because it has better sound but i find the volume to either be too quiet or too loud.
2762,9,i have the dot which i love...bought this for my mother and she loves it. sound quality is amazing! looks really nice and is not too big.
2763,14,"a great second act.  the sound seems improved, the array microphone is as great as ever, and the esthetic is improved to fit many living situations.  a great product."
2764,14,i previously owned a dot but i wanted something that had its own speakers. i was not disappointed. the quality was rich. and impressive for such a small device. my audiobooks sound like surround sound on this. way to go amazon
2765,14,"much better sound quality than i expected, but lousy wifi reception.  it is 15 feet closer to the router than the prior dot, and it still disconnects often - where the dot did not."
2766,14,not digging it nothing new here. 360 alexa is bs she never listens now
2767,14,"easy to set up, excellent sound quality and alexa easily recognizes voices and commands - even from a distance and when speaking somewhat quietly. i do wish i could hook up a second speaker via bluetooth to the echo so i could even more sound or in different rooms."
2768,10,love gettting my music just by asking!  very nice sound
2769,9,purchased for my 13 year old for christmas. what a great gift!! she loves it and uses her all the time for music. the rest of the family steals her also. the sound quality is excellent. great product!! will probably purchase another over time.
2770,10,i had to learn how to set up radio stations.this works very well. weather and time reports are great. wake up calls and answers to questions work well.  sound of speakers are great quality.
2771,9,"i recently purchased three of the new amazon echo is (gen 2) for family holiday presents.  they were a smashing success during gift opening, and they are used daily in the three different homes in which they sit.  set-up was a breeze and the new speaker system featured in the echo gen 2 is sounds very good (music, phone calls, etc.).  would highly recommend this product.good job amazon and mr. bezos!"
2772,14,"the echo is all that it was claimed to be.  it is a great addition our home.  we also now have the dot and a dock for that, located in the bathroom to provide any music we want.  we also control a light with the echo.  i can recommend the echo, hands down."
2773,10,"like it alot. my 12 year old son and i have fun asking alexa how to say certain words in different languages. its fun as we have made up some entertaining and fun names for our family pets! we have a cat that is plump. we joking say that she resembles a meatloaf. in german we have learned the word for meatloaf and now call her hockbraten!  it is silly, but it is also a way to keep learning different things in a fun a way!"
2774,11,great device. slightly more compact than the original echo and looks fantastic. it also has really good sound for its size and produces amazing bass. was really easy to set up from the alexa app and i now have it grouped together with the echo dot to play music simultaneously through both.
2775,9,"love alexa so much i have bought 2 of these, one echo dot, and an echo plus.  great if you have smart home products, or just want someone to talk to and play interactive games or learn new things from."
2776,14,"i wish we could play apple music or connect this to our smart tv for an extra speaker.  it is kinda worthless for us, except my kid loves to ask it questions, most of which it can not answer or quotes wikipedia.  it looks nice though, hence at least one star"
2777,14,"my fiance and i were debating between alexa and the google home and we decided to go with alexa because we love amazon. it is truly a a life saver! but since we have 3 kiddos, ages 11, 10 and 11months, we would have preferred the google home, only because kids ask the most random questions!! and of course we could just go on our phones and google it, because alexa, usually does not know it! but if there was a way to incorporate a google-like feature to alexa and answers random questions, that would be perfect!"
2778,0,"what an amazing lady, she answers all the questions"
2779,0,i like alexa. i enjoy the music although it has limitations. i like the shopping list a lot. i like the weather forecast but am disappointed that it is not specific to my location. my smart phone is more accurate. i like the flash news.
2780,14,"the worse thing with the 2nd gen is the volume keeps reverting back to 1.  not helpful if you use it for an alarm or if you ask it something from more the a foot away. the 1st generation doesnt have this issue, i had to switch around my 1st gen and place the 2nd gen in a room that i do not use as often.looks great though"
2781,0,"i have enjoyed the exho so much! the sound is wonderful and alexa is quick to respond to requests.  i did not order the extras so it can turn on and off lights, etc so i can not say how well that works but i would recommend."
2782,14,"i love my alexa!!!!! i also ordered the echo dot and love it too!!you will not regret buying this and my husband wants one for his home office, but i told him he would have to wait until it goes on sale again!i love the shopping list feature! my husband always complained that i never made a list and would make several trips to the store, now i tell alexa to put something on my list and when i go to the store its right there on my phone:)"
2783,9,"we love her! so easy to set up and use! i do not know how we have managed without her! the sound quality is great, comparable to our ue boom. very, very happy with our echo (alexa)!"
2784,10,"i am absolutely amazed at this device and am so glad i decided to try it out.  it is makes access to information, music, etc., simplified.  i am impressed and glad i made the investment in it."
2785,14,does not work. i ask it for something and she says i need to buy this or buy that.  such a simple basic machine the only thing  i can get it to do is when i ask it to help me relax .... then it plays waves crashing or rain ... i had a device 30 years ago that would do that... it was a gift and i wish i never opened it.  amazon provides no instructions or support... just buy more ...i had to give it a star .... should have option to put a negative symbol  in front of the star
2786,14,"my second echo... now have two echo is and two echo dots. they are great! great sound, picks up voice across room.  syncs with other home automation. great! highly suggest."
2787,14,"works great! i just use it for music, weather, news, texting, alarms, and timers.have not put any effort or money into the smart home angle but that being said, you just can not beat walking into a room and saying, ""alexa, play my music."""
2788,14,"hello!enjoying the echo quite a bit.  easy weather updates, news updates, stock news and lots of music to listen to.  sound is not quite as good as a bose mini but not bad! works great with the bose mini but i wish it could play on both at the same time.  overall, i like echo and alexa so far though i have to admit that i have not explored her capabilities all that far yet.  her skills keep growing, gotta love that!"
2789,10,"she is weird.  i like the device, but it gives me the creeps sometimes.  we do have many smart bulbs, so that is what we primarily use it for.  that and for basic information."
2790,14,"great sound. louder than the echo. however i spend a good 5 minutes every morning arguing with my echo to ""turn off alarm"" or ""alexa play this song""  she never understands. however . our echo dots pick up commands perfect!  only downfall on this is the ability to pick up basic commands. all in all a great invention."
2791,12,the jury is still out about how useful this is but it is great for playing music! set up was kinda a pain but we managed. still getting used to having it around! we will see!
2792,3,"love the echo, easy setup and does everything i expected.  great product and i highly recommend"
2793,10,"i like getting the music i like - not what a radio station thinks i like.this is really quite delightful for me.  i am ""old"" so my music tastes are seldom / if ever played on radio - now i can enjoy my old tastes.thank you."
2794,14,i purchased echo for its ability to play specific kinds of music by voice command without commercials which interrupt.  i have not explored at all all the other things alexa can do!!  the weekly emails which announce new features has expanded my capabilities!! it is far more than a music producing device!! it is simply quite impressive!
2795,10,"low-tech home here, so mostly using to play music as the mood strikes, set alarms/notifications, request info as opposed to manually googling.  appreciate that it is unobtrusive yet responsive - enjoyable addition to my home."
2796,14,"being an apple boy, this voice recognition blows siri away.  instantly recognizes voice, is very fast, ton of things and commands it will do.  audio quality is good.  better than i expected."
2797,12,we love this wonderful echo(2nd generation). the sound is just so very good and we are enjoying all of the great things echo is capable of doing.it was gift to us and we love it and use daily.
2798,9,"so many tasks are made so much easier with alexa!the speaker sounds so good, i gave away my big stereo system, and now alexa plays all my music from spotify!i¡¯m now setting up my entire condo to run on smart devices, run by alexa <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0080>so easy to use, my 3 year old niece asks questions of alexa! she is thrilled with very idea!i recommend the echo to everyone now- i¡¯ll soon be ordering a dot for each of the rooms- <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0080>"
2799,0,"i mainly use it as a radio using pandora and the tuner, but it also comes in handy as an expensive dictionary when reading too, lol. okay, so there is no real need for alexa right now, it is fun to use though and cool. ;)"
2800,1,arrived in new and excellent condition.  recommend.
2801,14,"the thing i liked the least is that the price dropped significantly after i purchased on black friday, and amazon has not even addressed it to me.  the sound quality is very heavy on the base with no way to adjust.  i use it to listen to music a lot, and it can be really awful for some songs."
2802,10,"love the sound.  i just tell alexa what i want to hear, and i can ""rock"" through the housework or enjoy some background music while we eat.  i like being able to put reminders of appointments or errands that need to be run on her agenda.  she never forgets!  she always has something to say when i greet her in the morning, and i love her sense of humor."
2803,10,received this as a gift and was initially a bit skeptical. but we love being able to get all kinds of classical radio stations outside our area through streaming. and my wife likes being able to ask for music from particular artists. the sound quality is adequate for its purpose. we also make lists and ask information questions. the convenience is wonderful...
2804,9,new item to me...a gift for my wife..getting used to it...
2805,14,"ok...i am confused. i have always considered myself somewhat of an audiophile. i have been listening to music for all of my 62 years, and have always been picky picky picky when it comes to the quality of what i am hearing. i am often told how picky i am. so....after reading the many many reviews of how 'terrible' the sound is on the echo 2nd gen, well....i just have to sit back and scratch my head. i do not get it.look....this is not some high end bose or klipsh speaker here. i am not expecting to sit here and marvel at the superb sound that some seem to think they should be getting. i listened to several songs from different decades, and songs that i know well, meaning the instruments and what i should be hearing, and how i should be hearing them. one song i tested was 'crystal blue persuasion' by tommy james. again....i sat back and scratched my head. asking myself 'what are they talking about. i did this several more times, and even got silly with 'inna-godda-da-vida' by iron butterfly. and then jazz...swing...blues...etc, etc, etc. either i am suddenly kidding myself...or many of you do not know what 'good sound is'. there is nothing wrong with this version of echo. and yes...i have the latest firmware. for a 2.5 inch sub, and a smaller up firing tweeter, this is awesome!!! i would not consider sending this back for any reason. next...i am gonna get the dot for another room so i do not miss anything when i am listening to my talk radio."
2806,0,"love it! i just wish i knew how to get it to learn! i will ask it a question and it does not know. i will then ask google and i will get the answer. but it helps me to remember things, schedule things, make lists, love the music!"
2807,10,who knew.  i thought it would be a novelty. i use it for weather daily.  for the music and you can tell it to play npr from our local station and it will. oh. and it also turns lights off and on.  the christmas tree was fun
2808,14,"just got the echo and really like it. there is a learning curve, but it is fun. can not get the amazon alexa app on my windows 8x phone. fortunately one of us has an android phone."
2809,10,we love alexa at our house...its is so fun
2810,14,will not answer questions. too politically correct. wants to charge $4 a month to play songs that  i have on compact disc. not to mention they are free elsewhere. not impressed with it at all.
2811,12,works great so far. just getting started with electronic home.
2812,11,i originally did not want to get one. one of the reasons was the design. the first generation just did not appeal to me. this second generation looks great and i am surprised how much fun i have had using it. i am glad i bought it.
2813,0,sometimes the device just will not responded and it is nessesary to reboot.  i still can not get the device to recognize my location although i have updated address.  in-between those issues it works well and i enjoy the simplicity but it can also be frustrating
2814,10,"i got it as a christmas present and love it.  a friend sent away for the alan jackson album with chtistian music and alexa played it fot me wright away and i like that the most. the fact that i can play music from prescott arizonais terrific, since we spent alot of time there this past year reminds me of good times there.  my daughter in law things this machine is intrusive, but u do not thinl so.  i think it was a wonderful grift and i would recommend it to ever would listen.  pat"
2815,10,"i love the sound! such a little speaker sounds fantastic. i just got it for christmas so i do not know how to use all the functions. however, the app has lots of good info introduced in a fun way."
2816,14,my family and i wonder how we got along without the echo.  i had a little trouble connecting to my network but even that was not a major problem.  setup and configuration was a breeze (once connected to the network).  i am going to love playing with this thing.
2817,14,"had many issues setting it up, and connecting to wi-fi, it still will not play pandora without logging into the pandora site first. it should not be this difficult. customer service was horrible - i would not recommend this to anyone. it is all way more hassle than it is worth."
2818,9,was skeptical at first but really enjoy now.
2819,0,i love my echo!!!! most of the time she is pretty good at understanding what i want. i mainly use her for music but it can be super handy when you are lazy haha
2820,1,what a great product.  the speaker is super-powerful and clear!
2821,14,i like access to music and information on demand. i am disappointed to the extent that i assumed alexa would be like siri when it comes to search and that is where the echo/echo dot falls short for me.  smart home applications are great. we¡¯ve just begun with that.
2822,9,"love this product.  purchased for a gift.  i now own tap, echo, kindle and dot - all terrific products.  told my son his first pokemon joke this morning.  what else can alexa do?"
2823,12,just getting used to it. lots of fun. amazing!
2824,9,"just like everyone else buying this smart speaker, i dig it!  watching my 2 young kids dance with alexa makes this device worth every penny! !  thanks jeff bezos!"
2825,0,"does not recognize or understand a lot of what i ask. although i set up my account and at one point remembered my voice, shortly after the system wiped out my settings and no longer knew who i was.  also, the music selection is limited and you have to have accounts in multiple apps. not as smart as it is portrayed on tv.  very disappointed. do not think it is worth the investment. maybe if i had more of a smart hime i¡¯d be able to use some of those features but i do not. a long was from being ai."
2826,14,"this is a great, beautiful sounding device.  i use it many times every day.  i highly recommend. this echo produces great sounds from all of my playlists. well worth the price b"
2827,0,"she answers the time correctly.she seems to have a generic reply  ""i am not sure"" to a lot of my questions. when i ask google the same question i get the answers i was hoping to find."
2828,10,"alexa can do so much, still discovering. plays the genres of music i enjoy.  love my shopping list.  although alexa does not know everything i ask, frequently she can inform me on subjects of interest."
2829,14,i had some initial problems in getting it connected.  with the patient help of customer service we had it operating in short order.  i am very satisfied with my echo.
2830,0,good sound for its size.  i love having access to my amazon prime music.  alexa is kinda dumb sometimes though.  google is much better at searches and answering questions.
2831,3,just love this does exactly what i want go for it
2832,0,"it was bought as a gift; maybe should have bought the show instead, but i know for a fact the recipients are using it daily and are learning more and more about how to enjoy it."
2833,9,i got this as a gift and did not realize how much i wanted one!!!!!!!  i love it!  the sound is good and i love the convenience of just asking alexa for what i want to hear!
2834,14,"echo was good but the app is a ""p.o.s.""  two weeks in and the app music feature so i can stop or turn down the volume is gone.  i got this for my senior parent to listen to music to go to sleep and not wake her buy going in to her room and tell the thing to turn down or shut off.  worked great for 2 weeks and now all it has on that screen is what you can tell it to do."
2835,9,love my echo. it is a great addition to my home. and it goes from room to room if i need it to. it is good quality and works well.
2836,10,"alexa can do so many things but the features i use the most are calendar reminders, music, recipe conversions (i do not do math :-) ) and the weather. love me some alexa!!"
2837,14,"i received my 2nd generation echo the other day and i am very disappointed with the ""improved sound"" amazon claims it has.  the sound is ""tinnier"" than the first echo and not nearly as much bass as the previous - just no richness to the sound.  i always felt that the sound in the first generation was equal to that of the sound i was getting out of my bose portable sound link - i was delighted and more than satisfied.do not get me wrong, the new echo is certainly better than the old transistor radio i used to hang from my handlebars (guess i am dating myself) but if they advertise that the sound is improved - it should be improved.if you use your echo to merely get the weather and set a timer than this will work as well as echo #1 but if you like to listen to music think twice!"
2838,9,never had one before!  it is great for pulling up song for my grandlkids.  my 6 yr. old granddaughter had one brought it out we danced to it.  well that was it i had to get one.
2839,10,use it all the time
2840,9,"it is the smartest little thing i could ever imagine!  we ask it questions and we play music and get the best sound quality.  we love it so much we ordered one for our mountain house, and one for our son. then we ordered the dot and a cable and my husband has it set up with his very nice bose speakers out on the porch."
2841,10,i unexpectedly received the echo for my birthday and am truly enjoying having it around the house.  we take it from room to room and listen to music and news.  i¡¯m stunned at the variety of things we can ask alexa to do.  i¡¯m still finding out new areas to explore.
2842,11,the volume is amazing compared to the dot.
2843,14,parents love it for their house and store!
2844,1,this little device is so amazing. the sound quality is fantastic.
2845,14,"i enjoy this item but 1 flaw that it has is when i set the alarm and turn up the volume manually its not an loud alarm but very soft and will not wake me up, but when your playing the music its loud."
2846,10,"wife loves it, now she can play annoyingly loud music with just the command of her voice.hard to set up.can hear you way across the house."
2847,0,i am enjoying asking alexa questions to see if she knows the answer.  first thing in the morning i ask what is the weather? this saves time from getting it from the news. i also enjoy playing my favorite music artists or types of music. some artists are only available by signing up for amazon is playlists for a monthly fee.the drawback is that it was not easy to activate. my daughter who is great at the computer took at least an hour to figure it out after i spent several hours.
2848,14,i can not seem to find the difference between them. ?????
2849,0,"i love the echo but the reason why i¡¯m giving it a 3 is because i started using it and all of the sudden a couple days of using it, it starts to not answer me. it would just pause there as if it were listening for a voice and not do anything. it got so frustrating that i had to unplug her and plug her back in and then it worked fine. then it happened again a couple of days later. it has happenend more than once and each time i have to unplug and then plug her back in. overall it is great."
2850,10,"we have thoroughly enjoyed our ""alexa""!  sound is fantastic and she will play whatever music we want, all day long!!  wish we had gotten her long ago!  she also gives us a traffic update and the weather.  we love her!!!!"
2851,14,"when i first bought the echo i was not sure if it was right for me but it sure convinced me right out of the box. not only was it right for me, my wife is really into it. she loves alexa too!  as for me, it is one of the best purchases i have made on amazon. <f0><u+009f><u+0092><u+0099>"
2852,0,"alexa is excellent at what she can do; however, i have asked her questions that she can not answer.  i am looking forward to use her more for controlling lights, etc."
2853,14,"a lot of fun, but still in its beginnings. but beware of this when it is on its 5th or 6th generation, by then we will be in trouble and by the 10th... skynet."
2854,12,"still learning with alexa, but so far, enjoy this echo.. good sound quality."
2855,14,amazon support for this s@$ks.  if you purchase unlimited music when it asked you when ordering this it does not connect with your echo.if you want to purchase music as. a gift that does not work.  trying to get support takes multiple phone calls and get different answers.
2856,11,"the sound is absolutely amazing!  the bass is better than the echo 1st generation which i have.if the price ever goes down to $79.99 again, i will get another one."
2857,5,this was a gift for someone and they love it!
2858,10,"cant live without it now... really enjoy being able to call out my shopping list, or ask for music to be played... love it!!!!!  and the speaker is pretty loud"
2859,14,"i love this new upgrade the speaker is so much better and once again it is portable and i can use it any where in the house or connect the two devices i have.  having amazon prime is also great, all the music i want at the sound of my voice.  i check recipes no more on line searching.  it is so freeing.  i just ask alexa and she finds recipes and reads them to me. the podcast are my favorite part of the access, i like the games also, great for the grandchildren."
2860,14,"it has been fun to mess around, sometimes alexa will not know the answer, the set up was easy, the most frustrating was the linked applications, alex never found any, only my manual input was the only way to link with other products, like smart plugs"
2861,10,"i love my echo!! best purchase i ever made! i love to listen to music, play jeopardy, get weather and news updates.  thank you amazon. i would recommend this to any of my friends!"
2862,9,"it works, i play music through it to help me sleep during the day and also to set an alarm.  amazing for what it does.  bought one for my mom also and she loves hers."
2863,14,"my husband gave me one for christmas.  my first thought was as ¡°what am i going to do with this??¡±.  after all i already have an iphone 6+, an ipad 5, and an ipad mini.  well i love it!!"
2864,10,"this was my christmas present and i absolutely love it. my favorite part is that with a spotify premium account, i can tell alexa to play a specific song or playlist without using bluetooth. she can also make calls without being on bluetooth. i bought the smart lights as well and smart plugs to turn on lamps and my bedroom lights all by voice. this is just the beginning of smart products and i love where it is going. the speaker is very loud and clear for the size of it. i highly recommend it!!"
2865,14,i have owned other echo products and this is the best.  the sound is very good!  i like the fact that i do not have to raise my voice for alexa to respond.older models required a loud voice for commands
2866,14,"not sure exactly what the purpose of this is, beyond playing on-demand music and getting a weather report. the sound quality is suspect, but that may be due to the location, as i have heard others that sound really good. the good is the are not expensive and do not take up a lot of room."
2867,0,product lacked a useful instruction book. the scant sheet accompanying gave little more than a guide to the buttons. i have had to ferret out information from other sources.
2868,14,i received an email echo dot as a gift i was trying to purchase a speaker for it but i was not aware i order d the entire device system - we¡¯re going to keep it - it seems cool for how i just have not learned how to use it properly yet
2869,9,got it for my wife for the kitchen. she is still learning to use it but loves what she can do with it already. i have rwo echo dots already and she wanted one too.
2870,14,"i cannot express how much i enjoy these speakers. a friend got me interested in alexa, and i started with the dots. i have been upgrading my entire home since then, these are fantastic speakers. just ordered another one!"
2871,14,love the echo 2nd generation with improved sound by dolby.  easy to hook up and easy to use.  we have a great time with alexa and her funny answers.  delivered when expected.
2872,14,"we bought the echo, with this purchase we got the dot, spots and the show. have dots in all the rooms spots in the office and our room, show serves as the main hub in the kitchen/dinning area, and the echo in the garage. we can call any room in the house by dropping in. pipe music throughout the house. or you can call any room by dropping in on the alexa app. this has been a great investment. the base of out smart home."
2873,14,"what is not to love?! works as promised, ease of setup and use. it recognizes everyoine in our household, including my elderly father is strong accented voice. we added dots through the house and started getting devices (ring, hue, etc.) to ""smart"" our home."
2874,0,amazon ought to give you this useless thing.  alexa is one of the dumbest girls ever.  she does not know a lot.  she gets very confused.  if you do not have amazon music there would be absolutely no reason to have this pos.  her jokes are dumb.  her facts are few.  you really must be very precise in forming your question or she will not know answer.  she does not usually know the answer.  so basically this is an overpriced speaker that connects to my amazon music.  that is it.
2875,14,"returned ours.  alexa was kinda useless since she is based on the bing search engine - what???  really??  we ended up getting the google home and it is been awesome.  we do not really care about all the home ""automation"" stuff - i just need/want accurate information."
2876,14,"it is unplugged now..  because i have caught it on (ring light bright) and questioned it out loud (""why is alexa on?"") and it automatically turned off.i guess it is true what the news was saying about alexa/echo"
2877,9,love this for playing music while getting ready for the day! asking questions about weather and distances from one place to another. <u+2764><u+fe0f> it! also ordered an echo dot!
2878,14,"easy to setup once i found the alexa app. but, i do not think i downloaded enough of the  items on the app. alexa can not answer some of my easiest questions."
2879,11,"i think a lot of the disappoint comes from having had the original echo, and having a good sound quality including bass. comparing the same songs in my living for both 1st and 2nd generation echo, the 1st generation cannot compare to the 2nd generation echo even with the software update. this product should be called all-new echo dot plus because it is a more luxurious than than the dot and sounds ""better"" that the dot. for me, this product is more fit for the bedroom or bathroom, and the original is for the living room."
2880,0,"ease of use is great finding skills is fun, controlling lights very handy. the only problems is sometimes alexa does not hear what was said and you have to repeat yourself multiple times, other than that it was a great purchase."
2881,12,love it!  easy to set up.  i use it every day.
2882,11,"so, the smaller size is kind of nice, but that is the only thong that is better than gen1.  the sound is not as crisp and full, the bass is not as good, and the wifi seems to have issues.  we have two of then gen 1 and they are simply better."
2883,11,should have bought more than one! love this item!!! best item and the sound is absolutely amazing!!!! crisp and clear and when you tell alexa to put the volume up she definitely does that!
2884,14,so glad i read the reviews on the echo models .... it was a gift for my boyfriend and he is really enjoying it.  still working out the details on what all it will do but we both enjoy it.  it has a good clear sound.
2885,11,"sounds better, is smaller and looks nicer then the 1st gen.  echo 2.0 is a winner."
2886,9,are very nice to have and make great gifts
2887,10,"love this!!!!  it is great to get updated on the news, weather & stockmarket.  i can get music, i can set a timmer.  it very easy to set up.  my kids ask it questions & have it play music for them"
2888,14,"though i will admit some of its features are pretty cool. loving the various music stations, weather, and ambient sounds. but at times it will ignore a command, it has a glitch somewhere for sure."
2889,11,this has nowhere near the sound quality you would expect based on the videos and as they been running.  i was expecting something better than the original echo but this got something between the original echo and the second gen dot.  turning the volume up all the way proves to crackle like the speakers are busting already.
2890,10,amazon products are great. i use my echo everyday for all sorts of things. i am now working on my smart home so i can use alexa to control all me things as well
2891,14,communication to establish our music plan for the 3 devices we now have within our home has been problematic.  it would be far better to speak with a representative who could place the product we want on our account and we would be able to enjoy far more than we are able to currently.  we are trying to get unlimited music for the 3 devices and allow access for each device to the unlimited platform including being able to drop in on a device in another room.
2892,14,this is my third echo and love being able to play my amazon music on all devices. i also like how you can send commands to my nest thermostat and my roomba.
2893,14,"the reason i gave it a three star was because of the app.  bought in the us but live in spain.  they said you can get the app in spain, you can not.  so it has been a problem.  everything but prime music is working now and working on this problem.  these are sold here in spain but the app is not available,"
2894,14,love my echo! love the fact that i can tell her to put something on my shopping list as i usually lose my paper list! also love that i can have her play any music i choose. just confused about it a bit. as i have amazon prime but still had to get amazon music for 3.99 a month! i thought that was free with prime.
2895,14,"love it, can get the weather in an instant and listen to music when ever i want. only one problem. i originally got the dot, then i gave it to my husband and i got this echo. problem is it looks like we can not both use them at the same time. do i need to put the dot i gave him in his name or will they still not work at the same time. or am i doing something wrong. we both like to listen to music, but different singers."
2896,10,great device.  am exploring ways it can help around the house.  hoping it can help my wife with her memory problems so am looking at what the capabilities are.
2897,9,love it....i bought this mainly to play music...the speakers are awesome.  i bought several of the dots for christmas gifts and there is definitely a difference in the sound.  a highly recommend the echo.
2898,5,this was a christmas gift.  they loved it.
2899,10,"this is our first foray into the world of a ""smarter"" home, and so far, alexa has not let us down. we are all still getting used to what echo will and will-not do, or what questions it can answer. i suppose there is a learning curve for both us and the device, but that being said, it is just plain fun to have around,  and available as we go forward."
2900,11,"i replaced my original echo with this and it is nice, i like the fabric covering compared to the old plastic one and it is shorter too which helps keep it out of sight."
2901,14,"enjoy the music and most queries,. but alexa has trouble understanding normal speech, even after voice training. google wins that battle hands down. sound quality decent in gen 2."
2902,10,"ask for weather, news updates, time, timer, alarm, music...music...music- good quality speakers inside. also, spell words, capitals of states, wikipedia information"
2903,14,the sounds from this is quite nice...it fits perfectly in the kitchen.  i have several alexa products and use dots combined with this for a group on multi-room audio.  this holds its own with the dots connected to high end audio systems.
2904,9,i love being able to hear music play simply by asking for it. the sound is great.  i bought one and we received one as a gift so we have 2 in our house now; one in the kitchen and one in the bedroom. it is perfect. i¡¯m the mother of a soon-to-be groom and i¡¯ve been listening to songs to help him select one for the mother/son dance at the wedding. it is been easy and fun with ¡°alexa¡±.
2905,0,"love this purchase especially if you enjoy music playing throughout your house everyday. it is great this comes with speaker. alexa does not have all the answers though whenever we ask a random question. just so your aware, alexa does not know everything lol."
2906,14,i cannot get the amazon echo to connect to wifi with internet access.  it keeps saying connected. but without internet access.  it will not give me the screen to add my internet password.  frustrated and ready to send it back.
2907,0,"to start off i rarely do reviews but i have to for this one. the speaker overall is good and  is louder than my google home but alexa is googles dumb cousin. tell her to play certain music and she does not understand. ask her certain questions and she does not understand. google home on the other is waaaaaay smarter and rarely have "" i do not understand"" remarks. echo speaker is good and software sucks compared to the google home."
2908,14,love it. have three throughout the house. the speaker on these are very good. the drop in feature is nice to talk hands free with others who have them in their homes. biggest complaint is the range of volume control which is 1 to 10. they need half adjustments such as 4 1/2.
2909,14,this works great and does not take up much counter space.  no problem with keeping the utility opening (where the wires connect to the dot) closed!  highly recommend!
2910,10,"this has been great so far.  it is made my life easier by giving me the weather, information, news and entertaining me through jokes and music.  i like it very much."
2911,14,purchased this a gateway tech for a parent to get them more involved with using technology. they are in their mid 70 is and love it.  the ease of interface has encouraged them to use their smart phone more as the alexa app sends the requested information to their phone and encouraged them to use a tablet and desktop gift that had sat for a year.  also great for hands free calling just in case they have an emergency and need to reach out.
2912,14,"this is pretty cool! after we figured out glitches because my hubby bought it for me xmas,and it was registered to him if you buy this as a gift, make sure you note that it is a gift. lost 6 weeks of a 3month 99cent promo on unlimited music because registered to different person. no biggie! did sign up for music at 3.99/mo- that is great! love every song at your command! do this, it is a blast! sometimes alexa can be stupid, but for the most part, answers questions well! have fun as we are!"
2913,14,i was disappointed i had to subscribe to amazon to listen to music. i wish i had gone with the google version where i get free music. i can say into my phone google play such and such and i get the music free. when i did that with alexa she told me i had to subscribe to amazon and offered to link me to the site. i feel this is just not the product for a non-amazon subscriber. unfortunately it cost me $79 to find out.  since i do not order a lot on line the $99/yr. just does not work for me. lee h.
2914,10,"a gift.  the receiver loves it!  mostly just plays music on it, so wanted to be sure it had a good sound quality.  hopefully she will figure out how to do more with it."
2915,10,i love my echo . alexa is good to have around the house in any room i keep her in my living room . if you are board your not with alexa she will tell you just about anything from the weather to recipes and will play music for you . i recommend to get the echo you will  love her .
2916,9,"this is a fun way to obtain information and music and causes smiles on my dad is face.  dad is 95 and is humored by the echo.  he can listen to his favorite 40 is music, find out what the weather is going to be for the day and learn about his favorite teams in sports.  thank you echo."
2917,9,"our first experience with alexa, we are loving it."
2918,10,"really awesome, having alexa. i love the flash briefing and the ability to pair via bluetooth. it makes for a great cooking assistant and her skills get better every day."
2919,0,"i enjoy having a voice respond to my inquires, weather,time, traffic, etc but i am unhappy with the music available.  i asked for michael jackson is thriller and was told that i had to pay $4 a month for that selection.  come on guys!"
2920,11,great sound for its size.the mic works as advertised. you do not gave to yell for alexa to hear your request.good bass and clear high end. we like it.
2921,14,"i was concerned about purchasing this, because of the reviews stating that it did not have good sound quality.  mine sounds amazing.  i stream the amazon unlimited music, and i could not ask for more.  it sounds nearly as good as my bose radio, but for a lot less money. all the extra skills are a bonus, plus it keeps the kids entertained."
2922,14,"since purchasing the echo, life has become so much easier for me and my husband. technology has progressed so far, and it makes me emotional to think about. i often leave my 9 month old under the care of alexa while my husband and i have date nights, and she is perfect at her job! i love knowing that my children are safe and sound under the care of this little robot."
2923,10,"it is very discreet on my table.  i am new at this so i am still learning. it was very easy to set up.  i like that i can play my pandora music.  the daily affirmations are fun to hear.  the echo works great!  comes on instantly at the command and turns off just as quick. i have asked things that i got an ""i do not know that one."" answer to.  looking forward to learning more!"
2924,0,"it has great sound . i find it shuts off for no reason some time .i ask it to play the"" carpenters ""  it plays one song after saying it is going to shuffle pay their songs .why??"
2925,14,"first smart home speaker. i was holding out for the homepod but i¡¯m truly amazed with the capabilities for the price. plus, i used the 5 months billing feature which was really cool."
2926,14,my husband has a thick hungarian accent and alexa understands him. that is pretty amazing for someone who tells the gps in his car to go home and the car says am radio.
2927,14,i have been a fan for a long time.  nice to see the new styles.  keep up the great work amazon!
2928,14,"not impressed with the limited capabilities this echo offers.  i think my echo lawn mower offers more.  ha!  limited songs are available because alexa informs you to purchase a monthly music app.  it will even provide a sample of the song and say go buy the program.  many times it will ""not understand"" your command.  i think it is a glorified alarm clock.  not worth the money."
2929,14,"love it! it  allows me to drop in on my 86 year old mother. if she were to fall, all she has to do is call me with alexa.  improved her safety a hundred fold."
2930,0,what is not to love about the echo
2931,14,"not worth buying to replace an existing 1st gen, but a great device to add to a home.i also have a cortana device that microsoft was giving away - and it makes echo look even better."
2932,14,"i loved this so much i ordered one for my classroom! my special needs students use it to help with spelling, pronunciation, and looking up meanings of words they do not know when reading."
2933,11,"the echo 2 sound is better than the dot but the bass tones can be a bit over powering. this is particularly so with spoken words.  hint: alexa, ""bass level 1-10""???"
2934,14,"not too difficult for a computer-challenged guy. then when i unplugged and moved to a new location, i had a difficulty getting it up and running again. then, when i changed routers, i had a very difficult time getting it back on line. it is up and running now and all is super."
2935,14,"get a google. they do not randomly turn on (regardless of the volume set at) and blast random crap when idle. not just laughing i¡¯m talking randomly turning on and saying sports things etc when no one is talking or said alexa. waste of $ and beyond return period. guess this is why they were cheap around christmas, they were just trying to get rid of the defective crap they knew they had in stock."
2936,11,"love it! i have the original echo and thought the sound was great, but the sound of the echo 2 is even better.  hard to believe the quality of sound from such a compact device."
2937,14,we love it and are amazed at all it can do.  the least favorite is when the songs are not included.  we are not going to pay extra for the rest of the songs.
2938,10,"i love our echo. we have 2. she wakes us up every morning with weather andvtraffic and puts us to sleep with ocean sounds. i call my kids hands free, it is great."
2939,0,better looking and sound has improved. alexa is still pretty stupid though and is unable to provide much in the way of answers to questions and general information. google she is not!
2940,14,"well i can not say that there is anything i really thoroughly enjoy about echo, i have used a competitor is product in the past through my phone app whose second name is assistant and is by far incredibly more intelligent and able to provide quick information without me having to repeat myself too many times. what i do like about it is it is hooked up to my music on my account so so far it is been a really good stereo"
2941,9,gift for my husband who loves it.  he calls up favorite music while working at this computer and constantly asks for weather updates.  should have gotten this earlier.
2942,10,alexa is a lot of fun ! i do not have to manually google everything i want to know now ! it saves my neck and hands from having to use my phone! just telling her to play a certain song is the best !
2943,0,"this gadget is so cool !  took some time getting used to it & what to ask, but once you get the hand of it it is fun !  would recommend if as it can be very helpful also."
2944,10,"it is just fun to talk to alexa!  it is quite handy to just wake up and ask the weather, add to ""to-do"" or ""shopping"" lists.  those go right to my app on my phone, which i always have with me.  so i never have to wonder anymore.  i can tell her to control my house temperature without having to pull up the app or walk into the thermostat in the hallway.  it is making me lazy...but it is so convenient!  i can sit at my desk and ask for a particular genre of music.  it is perfect!"
2945,9,i have two small echo dots and this has a much louder volume. great for large or small rooms. i love to listen to audible books while working around the house.
2946,14,"first day with my new echo and already love it.  using the timer, playing music.  i thought i had to pair it with my phone but when i asked to play a particular artist - alexa said playing from your library so i guess it figured out somehow."
2947,14,"i¡¯m loving my echo! i find myself listening to music more than watching tv and i upgraded spotify because of my echo, listening to radio stations on it i bought it pretty much for music but i¡¯m already thinking about buying another one for the kitchen. i was skeptical because of the bad reviews but honestly i¡¯m enjoying it!!!! i personally think it is the best home speaker because all that you can do with it. so it is gets 5 starts from me!!! great job amazon you did it again!"
2948,11,"the best i can say is wow! the echo ii has way better performance than the dot, sounds awesome - it may replace my  bose soundtouch 4.wonderful price, great product!"
2949,9,love love love love love can not wait for the spot
2950,14,"echo is a very limited device. it is strengths are playing music, anouncing the weather, playing short clips of new or npr.  it lacks the ability understand the same range of commands as siri.the hands free aspect is nice, but it has not really made anything in our life more efficient."
2951,0,"i like being able to verbally communicate my requests.  i dislike the limited ability for the machine to find answers (too many times i hear ""i do not know"" when in reality the machine should have access to the entire internet.)this is a product with no real need satisfied.  i can do more with my cell phone"
2952,14,"very cool item. the speakers sound great when playing music. my daughter loves it. ..although she has learned the hard way to unplug it at night. her older brother likes to say: ¡°alexa, set an alarm for 3:00am.¡±"
2953,9,"so far, so great! the sound quality is amazing for its size. the integration with my smart home equipment as well as the ability to play music all over my house is fantastic."
2954,9,"very good product! my son gave it to me as a gift, probably would not have bought it for myself, and i love it! alexa is very good on most questions. the speaker is very good. very satisfied!"
2955,10,"fun to use -- lots of ""skills"" to enable to keep you busy and entertained.  works great with smart plugs too!  still learning more tricks with it every day."
2956,10,fun to use now making my world smart.
2957,0,it works instantly with information.  amazing.  my biggest problem:  finding a use for it.  the music hook up is good but i have not explored all the uses of it yet.
2958,14,"it does not pick up my wifi connections other then the modem.  it is hard to figure out, i only use it to put items on my shopping list.  not really worth the money."
2959,14,"i wanted her to play johnny cash, dean martin and other christmas music but did not play any thing specific.  so she played amazon.  i was not impressed.ellen gallagher"
2960,10,this was a gift and i found that this is a great invention.  i have enjoyed it well beyond anything i thought i would.  the speaker is very good.  the voice is clear and easy to understand.  this is really fun!!!
2961,11,"i have been an early adopter of every echo.  the latest one is quite sexy, but i think the voice reception is a little worse than the 1st gen.  perhaps it is the cloth cover?  either way i love echo...alexa manages my whole house!"
2962,10,this is the best product i have ever purchased. i use it daily mostly for streaming music but it is fun to ask it questions too. i love it. sound is awesome as well.
2963,14,"great sound from a small package.  we have it sitting on a shelf with the cord draping down to the wall outlet.  but, unfortunately, the cord is black - so it makes a nice looking item look really ugly.  why do not do not the white-ish echos come with a white cord???"
2964,10,i love the benefit of a lot of information just by asking it. amazon supports this very well and keeps you up to date on it is skills and things to command it.
2965,4,great echo and easy to install.
2966,0,there are still a  lot of things that need to be fixed and added but i see the potential. there is some repetition in her skills and she still does not always understand what i am saying. hoping they keep updating her and making her a better ai
2967,9,i got this one for my living room . i like to listen to my music in my recliner. the speaker quality is amazing. just love it.
2968,11,love the material on the cover.  as described.
2969,9,"my wife and i are seniors and this is the first high tech product we are having fun with and,of course, we are learning much from alexa. great product.bob h."
2970,10,"alexa is great.  i especially like the ability to make grocery lists, listen to music, and find out answers to questions i have.  syncs well with my cell phone."
2971,0,"the echo hub has done everything as advertised.  biggest issue we have is it always listening.  not worried about it spying on us, but when the tv mentions alexa, it perks up and tells us it does not understand what we wanted.  not a real problem, just funny."
2972,10,this is so cool!  i love my echo and am learning all the different ways to interact with it.  i just purchased amazon music and enjoy the ability to listen to any and all kinds of music and genre that i want just by asking!  i am having a blast!
2973,2,thanks
2974,0,i like that it is hands-free and i can give it a command from any place in the house but i do not like is it does not recognize a lot of music that i would like for it to play  four instance if i ask alexa play american indian flute and drum music she does not know what that is
2975,0,"i love the music! it amazes me that the echo can answer my questions. the least i do not like is the volume, sometimes i have to play it back to understand."
2976,0,"you have to be very specific when asking alexa questions and it does not tolerate pauses in speech.  sometimes you have to ask a question in different ways for google to understand the question.  alexa is nothing more than a fancy alarm clock, a bluetooth speaker or a google search engine.  not really worth the $69 as my android phone can pretty much door everything alexa can do."
2977,14,thanks amazon this is great and sounds good i put it in my bedroom and it sounds as good as alexa i get my news weather and travel news all while lying in bed
2978,14,need to add amazon music unlimited for echo to it to play the music i needed and this cost 3.99 more a month but with out it there is not a lot of music it will play and this is the only reason i got it
2979,14,"love the sound...no more fiddling with cd is!  ended up putting 4 of them throughout house. not happy that if one is playing music, can not play music at same time on the other echo is. maybe i¡¯m doing something wrong."
2980,14,"a little difficult to setup, took a while to get iheart to work correctly. dropped configuration twice, but resolved by relocation to another spot in the room."
2981,10,"having alexa is:the answers to everything at my fingertips, all my favorite music at my request and constantly entertaining with jokes etc.  love it!"
2982,14,"my first echo, and the family loves it!  it provides convenience and fun and sounds fairly good for a small unit.  i do wish that it could access the music hard drive on my home server, but maybe in the future.  meantime, we are happy to have it!"
2983,14,initially very easy to set up and use.  basic functions are a nice treat like playing pandora or asking questions.  it would be helpful if amazon posted a list of most frequently used applications.  it probably exists but i have not hunted it down.
2984,0,alexa responds very quickly to voice commands. difficult to figure out how to do certain things. alexa app is pretty useless.
2985,11,i think the 1st gen echo was more responsive
2986,10,my grandkids really enjoy the games they can play with alexa. i love the shopping list app. but i am still learning all the things alexa can do. this has been a fun product to have.
2987,14,"just spend the extra money and get the echo plus.  it has the built in hub.  if you want to use this to control you lights, outlets, locks, etc.... you will have to buy the external hub and that runs about $50."
2988,14,alexia is always waiting and willing to help.
2989,9,"i love this echo, it has an awesome sound without looking like a undersized heater like the older one did and they are just helpful and fun to have"
2990,14,"i bought it, downloaded the icon onto my cell phone; but have not been able yet to get it to work.  have a techy friend who will be back from vacation next week and she will help me set it up.  then perhaps i can give it a 5-star review!"
2991,14,makes a great intercom system when the electric is working. needs some kind of battery back up.  sometimes connect to internet and other times dropped the connection. it also does not hear you correctly all the time. it is a very expensive toy.
2992,14,surprised the speaker is pretty good for music but did not own first generation so do not know the difference hooked up my samsung smartthings hub with ease overall great buy would recommend anyone who needs it
2993,10,"love my echo. was not sure what i was getting myself into purchasing one, but boy i was missing out. my echo has become my go to for almost everything. from scheduling, night light, alarm clock, radio, mail notifications, grocery list assistant, you name it and she does it. she even plays games and keeps my family entertained. and that is just the surface of her capabilities. i can not wait to get smart lights and a thermostat that she works with."
2994,11,"the only difference i found between this and my prior echo was the output jack for external speaker playback,  the unit it self does not sound any different than the original model."
2995,0,"i have yet to find something i do not like about my echo. very responsive to my queries. great sound, fun to use. ok - would be nice if it had a real search ala google or bing."
2996,10,my family and i are enjoying our echo! the kids enjoy the jokes and games in which they can play! i love the word of the day as well as they daily questions! such fun!
2997,10,"the speaker is stylish and has great sound.  i use it daily for music, checking schedules, and answering questions.  i am eager to start using smart devices with it next."
2998,0,"i enjoy the ease of voice command for listening to music, setting timers and adding items to my shopping list, especially.  sometimes when i ask for a pandora station alexa seems to have issues understanding me<u+2014>she¡¯ll say ¡®i can not find any music by so-and-so.¡¯  but usually i have no problems."
2999,10,"this is definitely worth the purchase. we love listening to the music it has, and even the fun facts she offers. she tells us the weather every morning and night too!"
3000,11,love the size and looks of this device. the now lower bass is awesome once its updated.
3001,1,"the new speaker is great, awesome sound and great volume"
3002,11,i like the size of the new echo but however i definitely think that the first generation one is louder. as far as sound quality goes i think it is just fine for something of it is  size.
3003,0,does stuff and is convenient
3004,9,i love these devices! i promote their use with friends so much they think i work for amazon...lol!
3005,14,"for one, it is not flexible. you have to be very specific with your words or it goes off on a goose chase. secondly, at times, it just shuts off if it it confused. thirdly, it does not perform the commands as advertised i.e. order pizza .huge hassel!  this device leaves a lot to be desired. when put to the test, echo seems to have been built by college students doing an experiment."
3006,0,she is a little creepy but otherwise great.  i bought it due to local radio station app but found out it is not live radio rather the type of music they play.
3007,14,"amazon shipping always on point. ordered and delivered the next day, as usual  - super fast. right now my echo 2nd generation has become an awesome home voice activated assistant-great sounds, exactly as advertised and priced. love the skills amazon alexa provides and updating regularly! thumps up amazon! great device to have! my home interactive voice assistant - awesome quality and meaningful device!"
3008,0,"great for questions, music and occasionally will give you an answe even when you did not ask a question. highly recommend. great listening to music!"
3009,0,great sound and speakers when playing music.  nor as smart as google when asking questions.  i find it very limiting when trying to access general information.
3010,3,how did i live without alexa before!
3011,14,this item has had significant difficulty connecting to the internet and is very slow to respond. i have friends with a first generation echo that does not have anywhere near the lag time that this version has. disappointed to say the least.
3012,14,i like it!  speaker is good<u+2014>not exceptional.  but i like it. i bought it to use primarily as a speaker to enhance audio from my firestick. and it does. i have no serious problems.
3013,3,great i have no problems with it
3014,14,absolutely horrible. wont respond a lot of the time.  have unplugged and reattached to wifi several times.  should  have chosen google or apple is product
3015,14,"got this after 'using' my daughter is over thanksgiving break.  fell in love with the 'shopping list' option and to play music.  i just need to figure out how i can 'purchase' songs for it to play. i have tried to go in on my settings and add my pandora, but it will not take it."
3016,0,love it!! sound quality is way better than i expected. the lists and reminders are awesome as everything is right there on my phone and who does not have there phone with them 24/7? stilling learning what all can be done on the echo.
3017,14,"these speakers will be a 5* if they were integrated with youtube, but no they are restricted so you have to buy amazon unlimited subscription. you can pair bluetooth with your smart phone to solve this problem."
3018,10,"i enjoy everything about this device.  i remember when the internet killed the encyclopedia.  well, now alexa is turning the interned into a dinosaur."
3019,14,"great to have for music, weather, news on voice command. a bit glitchy on programming. does not work with speaker on ""listening"" mode in kitchen because any loud noise turns it off."
3020,0,"and fits in with my family.. she has a speech problem h she blanks out, sometimes she finishes, sometimes she does not.  i figure she is got menopause like me."
3021,1,very happy with the performance and looks.
3022,10,"love my echo. fun facts, updates, games and so much more at your disposal! love alexa. great that it interacts with my other amazon devices. recommend to all my friends and family."
3023,10,"we have two echos, one for the living room and the other in the bedroom. we mostly listen to npr news and music from various radio stations. we enjoy having them."
3024,0,"still trying to figure out what all it can do.  it is neat and very useful for getting questions answered.  still has that ""big brother"" feel to me though."
3025,0,not as many useful skillz if you do not have a smart home. if you do not subscribe to amazon unlimited music the music selection can be limited. have to say the wake word multiple times before the echo actually listens to your voice commands.
3026,14,"this thing does more than i expected it to and its improving daily. recipes, weather, jokes, clever easter eggs, and so much more.we can all imagine what something like this would do and how it should be. amazon has done a great job of exceeding expectations and putting in features you may not have thought of.well worth the money!"
3027,9,"i love the sound. for the price, it has great value. i bought two to go along with my echo dot that controls the stereo. makes for a great surround sound without having to run more wires."
3028,0,"still learning how to use this - learning how to phrase questions.  this is great for our kids - because when they ask us questions, we have to ask a lot of questions in return to figure out what they want.  they have to really work on phrasing their question to alexa.  also love the fun extras - my kids have learned how to make alexa fart.  we laugh and laugh...it is the little things in life!  love the emailed suggestions...i look forward to those."
3029,14,i love the $99 echo. the sound is far superior to the echo dot. we bought one echo and 5 echo dots. now the whole house is wired. the system works great as an intercom. the only drawback i¡¯ve come across is that you can only assign a device to one group at a time. so you can not have an everywhere group and a downstairs group. this is minor and will hopefully be addressed in the future.
3030,14,this unit is great...the best feature in my world is the excellent quality speaker phone.  i use this echo nearly exclusively to phone now as the voice quality both ways is excellent!
3031,11,not an upgrade from gen 1.  i now have both and use the gen 1 in our family room and have relegated the new echo to a guest room.  voice recognition is not as good.  sound is not as good.  i expected improvements on the new model and found nothing better.
3032,9,already had one but my husband kept on borrowing it so he could listen to music when he works in the garage or the basement. so we had to get him one of his own.  he is not a techie and he is able to ask it to play anything he wants.
3033,10,"love my echo! the sound is amazing. i am learning new things about  it each day. i love listening to music on it. plus, alexa helps keep track of my grocery shopping list."
3034,14,other than appearance i have not heard or noticed  anything different from the original. also unable to get a portable battery stand for it.
3035,8,love it!
3036,14,great product. i was skeptical at first when purchasing this product as i questioned its functionality but i am now several weeks into owning this product and am very pleased at how versatile it is and the quality of sound it produces. i am going to be buying additional echo is for other rooms in my household.
3037,14,would have given a 5 star but we could not get it to work for us when we spent 2 months at the coast in our 5th wheel. other wise we like it fine and are still learning to use it.
3038,1,"good sound quality, sturdy, love it."
3039,10,good value. great present.
3040,5,my 86 year old mom loves this!  she is blown away with technology today.
3041,14,"nice little gadget. nice sound for its size to the average ear. listen to music quite often, enjoy most selections available. information requests are usually accurate and inquiries mostly acknowledged. recommended to friends and family."
3042,14,love it! i am not very good with technology or electronics but this was so easy. i had no problem. if you do have a problem they have a great support team!
3043,9,i received the echo as a christmas gift. it took me a bit of time to set it up but once i got it working it was the best gift i have gotten in a long time.
3044,0,love alexa except for when she decides to answers question that nobody asked her out of the blue.  so handy to make a hands free calltoo.
3045,10,this a christmas gift from our daughter and it was attatcher to her amazon account and it was almost impossible to switch from her account to our...
3046,10,sound and reception quality is great. picks up what i say 90% of the time. so much fun to have in the house too! all members of my household are enjoying it.
3047,5,"it was a gift for my husband, he loves it!"
3048,14,"2 words. sounds terrible.when compared to the series 1, these have almost no bass. the clarity is okay, microphones are good, but it sounds bad."
3049,14,"great. use it more than siri now. fills the room. but, my biggest concern is when i sleep. i love to fall asleep to talk radio, soft music or white noise. the bass just overpowers no matter what google trick you try and use or how my you lower the volume. real disappointing."
3050,14,"while it was easy to install, it has not performed very well.  it frequently quits in the middle of playing music; it will often fail to respond to its name; it is inconsistent in recognizing other smart devices and frankly the help feature on line is seldom helpful.  google maybe?"
3051,14,"such a handy/useful product, especially for the price offered in dec '17.great for music, reminders, questions, and more i am sure i will discover"
3052,14,"i had to go to you tube to learn how to install it, after that it was a breeze. the only thing i have not kearned is how to hook it up to the lights and stuff. next project, next time. otherwise, it plays what i have asked it to play."
3053,14,bought this for my husband for v day he has not quit talking to alexa! it worked out perfect it was delivered on valentines day really appreciate the awesome business i did with the seller
3054,9,"alexa is awesome. i bought it for my sons and my oldest one cannot be without her now. i am jealous.she wakes him up, she plays his favorite tunes and radio stations, she reminds him to go to the gym at 4:30 p.m. 4 days a week, she tells him jokes about all seasons, she tells him about nikola tesla (his ""hero"" because he is an electrical engineer), etc.the only question she never answers is when he asks her if she loves him lol"
3055,10,still getting used to it. learn more of what it can do as the days go by....it can hear me all the way to my bedroom. i was surprised....
3056,9,speaker is definitely improved from my first echo. i also gave my 87 year old mom one for christmas and really pleased by how much she is enjoying it.
3057,0,love it. was easy to setup. i can listen to pretty much any radio station worldwide.  can ask it to play a certain song etc. sounds great too!
3058,12,awesome product!  life changing features. works very well and has endless options. i would highly recommend.
3059,11,i love the ease of operation and the improvements made to the sound.there was nothing that i did not like about this productthank youbob
3060,13,this gadget is the greatest thing invented since the smart phone!!!i¡¯m blown away!!!! american ingenuity continues to be the technological pinnacle (and jealousy) of the world!! amazing device!!!!
3061,10,"ironically, my husband and i each purchased one to give to her for christmas! we returned one, and are enjoying alexa very much. love the shopping list feature, the trivia questions, weather, and even addresses of locations. the music streaming has been great--covering many genres, and it is easy to switch genre or ""playlist"" when you want a change. it has been great to ask questions verbally, rather than check for answers on line."
3062,0,"i am very disappointed  in my echo. the only thing i am using it for is to stream music, which is nice but i expected much more. it cannot find merecipes,or even help me with a crossword puzzle question.i really thought it would better sere my needs."
3063,14,"the sounds are great, however, i did have a problem registering the item with amazon.  i had to call and the young lady helped me register the item."
3064,14,very nice unit. the concept of it is just so cool. it even made an impression on my wife and she is not easily impressed.
3065,14,"very easy to set up. it looks good and has a great sound for my office. sometimes alexa decides to stop playing music on the echo but the dot will continue to play and she does not always listen to my commands and will play another play list?! but in the end, it is a great device once you tweak it to your specs."
3066,11,i love my echo. very glad i got it. hears me well. i just wish the music volume was more enveloping but it is still really good for what it is.
3067,0,"i like it can play my music bluetooth. i do not like that sometimes it has no idea what i said. and some times it says ""i do not know that one"""
3068,11,"the sound quality is great. was really concerned with all the negative reviews about the sound quality. however, it looks like they have worked out the bugs. like the new look and size as well."
3069,11,"like the choices in finishes and this 2nd gen does sound better than the 1st.  also, adding the volume buttons on top (like the dot) is helpful."
3070,0,i bought 3 for gifts. i¡¯m a little disappointed that it can not seem to answer some simple questions. it seems to say i¡¯m not sure a lot. almost bought google instead. not sure which would be a better choice.
3071,9,they work awesome and i love using them in my office. they sound great and it is fabulous that they will all play the same song. love it!
3072,14,"alexa continually stops playing.  she indicates she is having ""trouble understanding right now.  please try again, later"".  i am fed up with her."
3073,11,"the sound on this is amazing compared to the dot.  i was truly blown away!  i expected better sound which is why i bought it, but it exceeded expectations!"
3074,14,"i¡¯m an apple guy, always have been. but alexa is cool, get this and hook up to your wemo is, nest and harmony hub. better than siri by far for accuracy."
3075,1,delighted with this purchase.  great technology at an affordable price.adequate speaker for decent sound. a lot of fun and apps to explore. you
3076,14,i love it - my first echo and it is great!!!.now i have to save up to buy compatible products which controls the lights and other electrical gadgets in the home
3077,10,"i enjoy asking alexa the weather conditions outside, flash briefing, to play music and do the things that i would normally use my cell phone for. learning new things that alexa can do makes each day a new experience!"
3078,9,"yep. love it. i had the dot in my kitchen. after hearing the 2nd gen echo that my daughter is husband bought her for christmas,  i had to have one for the music sounds."
3079,11,improved sound over the echo dot but not as good as stand-alone blue tooth speakers of comparable size.  voice recognition ok but could use some improvement (alexa seems to mis-interpret initial commands oftern and have to repeat...speaking slower seems to help
3080,12,"she is still ¡°learning¡± me, but has been fun!"
3081,14,"one of those things that you get and then say ""why did not i buy one of these earlier?""  we use it primarily for music, but also use it as a resource as well"
3082,8,works great
3083,11,"we really like both generations; but think the newer, 2nd generation is a bit better. like sound quality and increased knowledge base. nothing to dislike."
3084,14,"not impressed at all. this newer model never seems to work all that well.  i seem to have to reset it constantly, the voice recognition is not good, so much so that i¡¯ve actually put this newer model into a guest bedroom and returned the old one to our main area.update:  still performs awful compared to original.  (which we loved!!)  if music is loud at all, it does not hear you at all. even from across the room i find myself yelling at it in order to get it to hear me.  it randomly lights up as if it is listening, but do anything.  not sure if i got a faulty unit, but it is gotten so bad i think i will just unplug it and not use it as it is well past return date,2nd update<u+2014>seems to be getting worse as time goes by. never recognizes what you say, if the the music is above volume level five you have to scream to get to hear you. why did they got rid  of the ability to control the volume with twisting the top i¡¯ll never know either.older generation was definitely much better!update 4/6/18practically unusable. piece of garbage. buy a used older generation one on ebay if you can!  constantly get ¡°sorry, i¡¯m having trouble understanding right now. please try again later.¡±  have rebooted this unit 1000+ times."
3085,14,"let me start by saying that my whole home is controlled by alexa, including my 2018 f150. i upgraded my first generation echo to the second generation, and although the sound is great, i dont feel it works as well as the first generation. i have had more issues with the second generation understanding me than i have had with my first generation or my dots. hopefully this is a software issue and amazon can supply a fix. orher than that, i love my automated home!"
3086,10,"we love this device.it takes patience to learn how to make it work  and get everything set up but its wonderful. i got it for my wife as a christmas gift and she loves it, and she is not technically oriented at all. music, jeopardy , questions are all wonderful . we have not even scratched the surface on what this thing will do. getting it hooked up with all of the amazon prime was effortless since we were already members!"
3087,14,"love the unit and the sound is pretty good. amazon needs to add a lot more to make alexa the perfect home assistant, especially updating the ipad ap."
3088,0,"when it comes to general trivia questions, alexa does not know the answers most of the time. google is still a better tool. i would not have spent money on this for myself, but it was a nice xmas gift."
3089,14,"making telephone calls has been the greatest conveniience, eliminating the inconveniences of using speaker phone and holding phone certain distances and directions from my mouth. the echo speaker and microphones are very directionally accomodating. the speaker sound quality is fine for me. other than not being a green bay packers fan, helluva woman!"
3090,10,i love that it is so easy to play music! just ask aexa.
3091,11,this thing is amazing. i am blown away by the sound quality from a speaker the size of half a wine bottle. even its bass is top-notch. it fills the room.
3092,9,"i purchased the echo dot a few months ago.  it was great.  so when i wanted better sound, i bought the echo.  the sound is wonderful.  people are often amazed that the great sound is coming from the echo. i highly recommend it.  my echo is my main source of music in my great room.  and the echo dot is now on my bedstand."
3093,11,"great sound! so much better than the dot. i have a rather large bedroom and master bath suite and it fills the room with my favorite tunes. the bass is good, not overpowering and the sound is clean and clear. so much better than expected.....+ it is nice to not need another bluetooth speaker paired for decent sound!"
3094,14,we got this not too long ago.  we thought we would listen to music with it.  we have but not as much as we thought.  we have tried to make multiple shopping lists and it does not always remember the list. its okay.
3095,9,"easy to setup. i love the sound, fills my living room nicely. very happy."
3096,10,"bought it for my husband for xmas and we both love it.  music sounds great.  answers questions, weather, timer reminder, wake up call. (we currently choose not to turn off lights, etc. or use phone command.)"
3097,11,not happy with this product. my plus and dots far exceed the voice range on this thing. i have to be right on it for it to pick up my voice.
3098,10,this was my first alexa device and i have really enjoyed using it daily. it has been a pleasure discovering all the new capabilities of this device that seem to evolve almost daily.
3099,0,"only had it a few months. but am enjoying it so far. wish alexia knew who ""tool"" was. but shes  learning... right? lol. so far so good otherwise. i will update my review on down the road!"
3100,11,"i love the 1st generation echo, and love the 2nd gen even more. not as tall as the gen 1, but the sound is more rich and it has better bass tones."
3101,0,"could not answer a lot of things i asked it. had to pay extra for larger song base. if playing music relatively loud, have to scream to get it to respond to stop or lower volume commands."
3102,7,fun and useful for adults. kids can talk for hours with it. they have so many questions. get the app and see what questions they have been asking. <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0082>
3103,11,sound fills the room. i bought this to replace an old  bose speaker that was havivg bluetooth issues. though it does not sound as good as that it but then i did not spen $300. it does multiple things plus have pretty good sound. if needed i would buy again..
3104,9,the sound is phenomenal!! i love everything about this echo! it hears me from pretty much anywhere from my house!
3105,10,"on time delivery, good sound, voice activated,good product that can also control tv"
3106,7,we love this echo version. the sound is really good and even my 3 years daughter can talk to alexa <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+008a><f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+008a><f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+008a>. it was a pretty good birthday gift from my bros!!
3107,14,awesome with my ne hue lights. just wish it supported multiple commands. kind of annoying to have to say alexa everyone you issue a command. but still great
3108,0,"nice sound and alexa is nice. the echo does not respond to voice commands promptly. i frequently need to repeat several times before getting a response.still getting a lot of ""i do not know that"". when i ask a question. i am anxious to see future improvements"
3109,10,"love my echo..it helps me remember to put things on my shopping list without writing it down, and gives my daily articles that meet my interests. the sound is great for doing anything around the house."
3110,11,love my echo!! this has superb audio quality.  definitely an upgrade from the dot.
3111,14,"i had a hard time with the initial setup.  it took 2 days to finally get it to work.  i really like all the things you can ask alexa.  i like alexa will keep my grocery list so i do not have to write it down.  i wish echo could send the list to my phone, but all i do is go to the website & my list is there."
3112,11,great sound for a smaller echo. love the multi-room capability with all my echos. works great with many smart home devices. i still have much to learn.
3113,0,works perfectly. no issues. i love being able to yell loudly in an apartment by myself for someone to turn on jazz music and it working instantly. thank you alexa. you listen better than a lot of people in my life.
3114,11,"love my echo (2nd gen) !! i started out with a echo dot worked really well except was not as loud as i wanted for living room area, moved the dot to bedroom and volume was perfect!! so i replaced the dot in the living room with this echo (2nd gen) and its way louder then i needed !! the echo picks up on commands a lot better and you do not have to be to close to it, looking forward to getting another one very soon !!"
3115,10,"i love this thing.  use it every day for something odd and different. weather report for day, add something to my shopping list, ask questions instead of looking it up myself.  great for the home."
3116,10,set up was super easy! we enjoy getting weather updates any time we want..... along with answers to dozens of other questions! looking forward to having a dot in every room someday. being able to have the echo turn lights on and off is very helpful.
3117,10,i love the echo. the charcoal fabric is classy. it goes well with my decor. i am enjoying asking alexa questions and getting the answers i need. i am very happy.
3118,10,"controls my music, lights, security, and temperature of our home.  also tells me the time anywhere in the world and acts as my alarm and timer"
3119,14,"buyers, parents, and gift givers beware!for starters, if you gift this item to someone and do not select ""gift"" when purchasing the item, apparently the device will be linked to your amazon account automatically. unless the person receiving the device ""deregisters"" the echo from your account when setting it up. this basically means that the gift recipient can (knowingly or unknowingly) setup their device and purchase music/items under your account (if they do not deregister the device). this was told to me by the amazon echo support team.having said that, my husband setup a dot for he & i (that i ordered) and did not ""deregister"" the device but it did not automatically setup under my account, he was able to use his own. our daughter on the other hand setup her echo (that i ordered), created her own account with her email & her payment info but the echo registered under my amazon account and i was charged (she was also charged). i contacted amazon about this because i never approved or signed up for it and that is when they told me that because i purchased it they assume i will be using it (because i did not mark gift) and therefore it gets linked to my account. this basically means that while it appears new in box, the device itself has already been registered to you before they ship it out (shady business practice if you ask me). i advised them that it appears that the echo is linked to both my account and my daughters, to which multiple people denied this being possible. they were not even remotely interested in hearing that this could be possible. but here are the facts...my daughter downloaded the app (her phone), created an account (her email), entered payment info (her card) and purchased a subscription that she paid for the first month. through her app (her account) it shows all her history in talking to alexa and asking for songs to be played...so clearly her echo is linked to her account. ok, now i did not sign up for anything echo/dot related (nor did i have the app), yet one month later i was charged a monthly subscription fee, apparently the first month was a free trial (gee, thanks?). i contacted amazon to cancel this mysterious subscription and they did, but that caused my daughters echo to lose it is music subscription capabilities. this is how we discovered the problem. after hours of being on the phone with them (3 different people) they still swear that it is not possible for one device to be linked to 2 accounts. that the first month she paid for was a subscription that could be used on other devices, blah blah blah. but she did not use the subscription on any other devices, her phone was in my possession (digital detoxing), and her account shows all the alexa history and music selections from her echo. they still said it is not possible for one echo to be linked to 2 accounts. so playing along with them and their answer, i then asked if according to what they are saying if we had not caught this then my daughter could be charged monthly for a subscription that is not even linked to her device, the man confirmed this is true. um, what?!? so despite it ""not being possible"" to have one device linked to two accounts, it is and it happened with ours. how can you say that an account showing all the history of everything that echo has been asked or music played being on one account means it is not linked, then charging another account as well, i would say that was linked too. oh, and you can be double charged somehow. ?!? smh...to parents buying this for their kid(s)...there are no true parental controls! as some have mentioned you can turn on a feature in the app that disables voice purchasing and you can add a voice pin # through the app, but if your kid is logged into the app on their phone/device they can simply turn that off and they can also visually see the pin #, so that kind of defeats the purpose. also, there is no way to turn off explicit music if you subscribe to amazon music. from research i have done it seems like you have to specifically tell alexa to play the clean version, if there is also an explicit version in existence. for example, i asked alexa to play sexyback, she answered by saying she was playing sexyback explicit version. i had to specify for her to play sexyback clean version for her to do so. some songs i requested she defaulted to the clean version, it seems to be hit or miss. but if you have a young child or one who does not understand (or want to) ask for the clean version, you could be in for a shock. i have a tween & teenager, i highly doubt my teenager is always requesting ""clean"" versions of songs behind my back. hey amazon, thanks for the backdoor to allow my kid to listen to whatever they want when i am not standing right next to them, i appreciate that (grr). i do not even know how many songs have explicit versions to them, do you?  probably not, therefore you will always have to ask for the clean version just to be safe and train your kids to do the same. that to me is a bit ridiculous, not to mention dangerous. echo is not family friendly as it is perceived to be (via commercials, etc). we have only had the echo & dots for a month and i am already not a fan. i speculate this is why apple has not come out with their own version, maybe they are working on the bugs/features that amazon did not bother to deal with and introduce. and by no means am i applauding apple, i am not even a fan of them...oh, and i did ask whether the problem we were having was a difference between the echo and dot, i was told no...it is still not possible for one device to be linked to two accounts. (me... rolls eyes into the back of my head)"
3120,0,the speaker is very good. mainly use it for mood music. once in a while i test alexa on something new and she will not understand. but she seems to be learning every day.
3121,9,"i love the rich sound i can get from this device, and the portability. i pick it up and carry it with me to different rooms whenever i want music there, and the ability to use alexa from wherever i am to control lights and ask questions or pick music is wonderful.  liked it so much, i bought them for my relatives for christmas presents."
3122,9,wonderful device . . . my friend saw it & is getting one for her mother - who has a hard time getting around - & the hands free will be most helpful!!!
3123,14,"i am not a tech-y person, and neither is my wife. we received this as a gift. once we set it up it worked well. the speaker sounds great. the only real qualm we have with this is the need for different subscriptions in order to make full use of the features. if you are like us and do not have a smart home,and primarily use it for pandora and a quick weather forecast for the day before heading out the door then it is okay. it is not bad, and also not a game changer."
3124,10,i love being able to ask for songs without having to do anything else but asking!! plan on making my house more automatic with other products like lights etc
3125,0,"it does everything my dot does but i was hoping to get a better command awaking, but neither responds every time without sometimes having to yell."
3126,10,"my whole family is enjoying using this device.  there is enough features to keep you entertained and i¡¯m happy to se there are more and more other devices that work with the echo.  my only regret is that i want to personalize it some more like being able to program specific alexa responses to specific questions.  like, ¡°alexa, who is the greatest football team?¡± and, of course, the response is your favorite team and not the actual winningest team in history."
3127,10,"we love alexa echo 2nd gen. asking in the correct way is sometimes challenging. however, we enjoy the weather updates, news, music and answers she provides."
3128,1,great product and very useful too!
3129,14,"i have enjoyed the amazon echo since receiving it for christmas. it comes in handy on a daily basis, with setting reminders, timers, and alarms. i also use it as a stand alone music speaker. the sound is great at low to mid level volume, but loses bass when turned up past level 6. also, i wish it had a rechargeable battery so i could move it from room to room without unplugging. aside from those small cons, the echo has been a great addition to my home."
3130,4,nice unit no problems hooking it up .works good
3131,10,"i received this as a gift. i love it. it was so easy to set up and has done everything i have asked it to, except predict the winning lottery numbers!"
3132,10,"i like having alexa sysnced with the contact list in my phone. hands free calling is wonderful! i also enjoy music, updating my calendar and shopping list while walking by alexa.  the convenience has been more than i expected."
3133,14,the 2nd generation is great. alexa picks up on everything i say unless volume is maxed. easy to connect to a phone with the alexa app just wish all amazon speakers were compatible with the echo via bluetooth.
3134,10,echos are a wonderful product. alexa is a great thing to have in the house for controlling lights and music. music everywhere is awesome.
3135,14,not as cool unless you want basic questions answered.  does not bluetooth with laptops well.  for iphone users this can be painful.
3136,14,several times alexa will not execute the request. i have to reset the skill before the device will play it properly. the device is often hit or miss.
3137,10,i really enjoy the quality of music through this system. get a kick out of alex is jokes and appreciate the quick response for information. wish she could help me diet:)
3138,14,i had delivery problems with amazon.  alexa and support is not so good yet.  better if you can figure out on your self how to use it without alexa.
3139,14,"an interesting device that sounds good also. i use it mostly for listening to distant am radio stations during night time hours, but not much else."
3140,11,"the sound on this is horrible. i<u+fe0f> like the look better, but the sound is so tinny! you¡¯re better off buying a refurbed gen 1. such a disappointment. i¡¯m returning it."
3141,11,works great but does not sound as good as the echo plus
3142,7,looks great sounds great way better than google home<f0><u+009f><u+0096><u+0092><f0><u+009f><u+0096><u+0092><f0><u+009f><u+0096><u+0092><f0><u+009f><u+0096><u+0092><f0><u+009f><u+0096><u+0092><f0><u+009f><u+0096><u+0092><f0><u+009f><u+0096><u+0092>
3143,14,"got the echo for christmas, just learning all of the features, but so far i am very impressed with my echo.  i also have an echo tap which i really like.  the dolby sound is unbelievable great in both devices.  would highly recommend either or both units"
3144,14,having some issues with proximity to echo dot. dot answered before echo main unit which is much closer than dot.!
3145,10,"very entertaining. i especially enjoy hearing whole musicals, symphonies, and favorite pieces of music i enjoy. also able to pause and continue later if the music is not fully finished.once in a while it gives me things i did not ask for."
3146,14,"i am loving the echo - especially paired with the fire tv - it is great to be able to control what my kid is watching even when i am in the other room. the hearing on this device is amazing! i did have to change the wake word to 'echo'. because of my positioning every time an alexa commercial would come on tv, it would trigger my echo to respond. all in all, cool product and a fun christmas gift."
3147,1,perfect!
3148,14,"seems to work well and we enjoy it, but it is one more thing that allows intrusion into your life and who or when they intrude seems to be an unknown."
3149,0,product is just used for music and weather and it couldnt be better...ease of use is exactly why we bought it
3150,11,we are loving this product.  great sound and the form factor is what we wanted.
3151,14,"alexa and i are still getting to know one another, but we are already on the best of terms!  set up was easy and fast, using the alexa app."
3152,9,love it!! i bought this for my daughter for her birthday and she loves it! she can call out songs she wants to hear as she is getting ready for school etc.
3153,10,this thing works for everything and anything. great for listening to music and making calls to family and friends well multi tasking
3154,0,completely disappointing!! this cuts out more times then not and i have high speed internet etc. it cuts out when i¡¯m only using it as music and working. alexa tells me quite frequently ¡°i do not know what went wrong¡± i¡¯ve had this thing for about 5ish months so there is no reason why something i spent a decent amount of money on would already not work consistently!
3155,11,"great, much richer and room filling sound than my first echo. looks so much better and feels more homely that the first also. really pleased with this"
3156,14,alexa does a better job at understanding my questions than siri on my iphone. love the gray color and the ability to ask for music while i work.
3157,0,"uses bing as search engine, many questions are unknown to alexa."
3158,14,great and helpful device. very easy to set up and sound  quality is very good. have added 4 wifi smart sockets for lighting control via voice and smart phone.
3159,0,"i really enjoy the convenience of being able to listen to music, make shopping lists, etc.  i do not like that i can not figure out how to make a list of multiple items at one time. also, it takes some time to learn all that alexa can do. i know i am not using my echo to its full potential yet."
3160,14,"i received echo as a gift and was somewhat skeptical if i would find it useful, boy was i wrong.  the set up was extremely easy and once i began to ask alexia questions the more i realized what an amazing enhancement alexia can be.  among alexia is many talents i have found problem solving to be the most fascinating."
3161,11,"love our echo is...with our decor i needed dot and echo in whites.. and this one deff fit the bill - beautiful outer coloration, slightly speckled texture, will work with whites, light grays etc and blend in beautifully."
3162,14,"l i have not used the 2nd generation echo, much however i am quite please with the echo. the unit works extremely well and i look forward to many years of use."
3163,12,alexa is so much fun!  i love the echo.  the sound is amazing!  everyday i learn something useful that i can do with the echo.  great product!  highly recommend!
3164,13,awesome! best thing i ever bought.
3165,14,"little disappointed in sound ,was hoping for  little more bass and cleaner sound . but i like what it is used for,little music in kitchen while cooking or using the apps to find things out. if they did not offer a discount when i ordered i would probably send it back for something a little better sounding"
3166,12,i received this as a gift.  i must admit i was skeptical and maybe a little intimated (i am 67).  but i have had so much fun with this.  i use alexa every day.  would highly recommend it.
3167,14,"i hate to be negative about these echos... i have five (two shows a first gen echo, dot, and the new second gen echo ) and i could *love* them. they go great for a bit and then all of sudden they can not understand commands they get right 200 times before that. very frustrating.for home automation, i run the first gen hook smart home hub and the second gen samsung smartthings smart hub with a bunch of sengled element programmable led smart bulbs. the hook never misses a command but the samsung has issues from time to time. it is super frustrating to be standing in the dark with a bag of groceries fighting with alexa over the lights. i really wish the companies would get this crap right. it is just z-wave people.i wish the alexa app was better written. it is slow, sloppily designed and details are missing. as a software guy... the flaws drive me crazy. it is just lazy programming.i would love to get a refund on the first gen echo as it is never worked right and every time i turn it on, it makes all the second gen devices stupid in my house. you can not fix it.there are moments i want to send everything back to amazon. 3 stars. could be 5."
3168,4,great sound quality!
3169,9,"this was recommended to me by a friend and i love it, does so many things and the sound when playing music is great for the size of the of this echo."
3170,0,alexa keeps me company when there is no noise in the housel.  i especially like playing games with her.  the thing i dislike is when asking her to play a song by a particular artist (especially an oldie) she may not have the entire song and plays a sample.  that just makes me want to hear more.
3171,11,one of my best decisions on amazon!  sounds fantastic!  speaker is great for being so little.  looks great on my counter in the kitchen... what more can i say?
3172,0,am very disappointed with this product. it would not to my wifi.
3173,0,alexa does not know as much as i think she should...i am aware she has capabilities to do other things...but it seems her search is limited...example....what is nfl players so n so record....and when she does answer sometimes it is to much info just need an answer not a full wiki description
3174,14,i do like the unit but am still disappointed by its limitations.  i am also not a fan of the additional costs associated with its operation.  i have amazon prime but to access the music i want  pop another 80 dollars a year.  same for audibles  pop 14.98 a month.  i have caught the unit giving false information especially the weather.  still not enough content and areas of coverage.  i will continue for a while but i fear it will wind up in the closet soon
3175,14,i love it. wish it did not have to be reconnected with password to wifi each time power goes out (does not store password). that is only criticism.
3176,14,"worked perfect right out of the box, easy set up. was a little hard to connect to bluetooth speakers, but once connection was made and i understood how to work with it , everything was great. speaker quality is what to expect from a bluetooth speaker good but not not great."
3177,11,love the addition echo to our dot.. really cool talking from room to room as well as the loudness of it.. do not even need a speaker for music with the echo really loud throughout the house..
3178,0,"pretty cool. i like to use it to play music when im at home or to tell me with the weather. its not really useful for me other than that but others may find better use for it... it does grocery lists and stuff like that too so, idk its a cool gift though that i got for christmas"
3179,11,i love the dynamic sound very good i would recommend this product.  the change i did not care for was the push button volume control. i prefer thering adjust volume control.
3180,14,"to difficult to set up and to track the charges it is creating, its subscribe to this and that and this and that to get its info, e.g. amazon music, amazon premium music, amazon news, amazon ..... i am a prime member and all this should be included in a single bundle.  so i am going to throw the thing away and cancel all of the amazon subscriptions."
3181,10,"i was amazed by how easy it set up, and my favorite use is to play music by my favorite artists selected by my voice from anywhere in the room."
3182,10,"i received this as a gift quite unexpectedly.  so far we are enjoying alexa, the games, the instant weather reports, and music immensely.  with a bit more time i expect we will know more about her talents and expertise and be able to tap into them.  super-easy to set up.  have not connected the phone app to the games (i am not that competitive), surprising sound quality, and very inconspicuous to have in your home."
3183,9,"really like our new echo! we have a dot in the kitchen connected to our bose, so we put this in the bedroom and we use it much more than we anticipated. it has great sound!"
3184,10,i love this thing  on use it every day for all sorts of things i do not know know how i got along without it to tell the truth! best buy ever!!
3185,1,works so well that we cancelled our sirius radio and use this primarily in our home. this saved me almost $309.00 sound quality for a small unit is wonderful
3186,14,"awesome product, but no parental controls on music streaming! my son loves it and uses it to wake him up and takes it to the bathroom for music when he showers. i love that i can see and hear everything the kids ask alexa. for example, i know my teenager is friends have been experimenting with drugs and alcohol and my son son has been asking alexa for advice. if the cost came down, i¡¯d buy one for every kid in my house - and myself too."
3187,1,super product and great price
3188,10,"when i need a joke i get one nice and clean and funny, music wow ! so many choices, speaker quality excellent and i wear 2 hearing aids.i really thought this gift was a vanity, but have found value every day i speak to alexa echo 2nd gen,"
3189,14,"the sound seems kinda muffled in this version. also, it cuts in and out on my radio programs. finally, why can not i use my amazon remote from the 1st edition of echo?"
3190,0,sound is great once you figure out how to download music into her. the one thing i do not like is that you have to download everything into her. for people like my husband and i who are not computer geeks it is a little hard to understand sometimes.
3191,9,"this was a christmas gift for my sister. she and her husband loved it so much, they bought two more! one for the oldest sons room and the screen version for their room! lol"
3192,10,i love that it is quick and easy.  i am terrible at writing things down and remembering things and alexa reminds me.  i just wish it were connected to you tube.
3193,9,"i love it. my sister has one and told me whyt.i love it! my sister got one last summer and told me what fun it is. she as so right.  i love the morning flash briefing and music playing whenever i  i ask. i am still learning about elena but so far, the echo does not disappoint!"
3194,14,"this is one of the most fun and interesting technological devices that i have ever owned. for $100 bucks, you just can not beat it. the sound quality is incredible for its beer can size. home run..."
3195,14,"i am 48 and could be losing my hearing but i did not really hear any improvements in the sound quality.  the great item is the addition of more microphones.  it is much easier for alexa to hear you over the music or room noise.  you do not have to scream ""alexa"" to turn it off or move onto another song.  that was a big improvement from the 1st generation."
3196,14,love it. love the different color options. we use the multi room music option often for ¡°stereo¡± sound around the house. love the option to talk to other family members in different parts of our house. the only thing that is lacking is on the speaker/volume/sound quality when talking to someone in another room. sometimes hard to hear. other than that same great performance that i¡¯ve enjoyed from echo products
3197,0,"this is a great product. the sound is really clear, and also it recognizes words very accurate. the volume can be as loud as a speaker. so yeah, i think it is totally worthy to buy it."
3198,10,fun device.  we use it mostly for music.  alexa seems to not have the latest sports scores which can be annoying but otherwise the info is good.
3199,10,i love my echo. alexa does a lot of really cool things and we use her daily. even the kids use her! and i love finding new things to use her for!
3200,0,i love that it has some old singers like eddie arnold and patsy cline on it.i wish the sound was better. one song loud next one quiet. sound not real clear.
3201,14,"easy set up, great price, and still trying to figure out all things the echo can help with. like it so much i bought an echo dot for another room!"
3202,14,i love my alexa it is a blast my friends and i love to hang out drink at home and play games on it. there is so much it can do that i have not discovered yet. only downfall is sometimes there is a random glitch and she will not hear me or shell be listening and just not respond or when we¡¯re playing song quiz the game has just randomly stopped before. part of me thinks it is cuz there is some other noises in the background but i¡¯m not sure. either way i love her!
3203,14,"i am just getting started with my echo but i am satisfied with it so far. i like the sound very well. i also like the wit the software package has. what i do not like is that when you open the device with the word alexa it closes after the slightest pause in your command and you have to reissue the command again. difficult to compose or add more than one item to a list. other than that, i am very satisfied."
3204,11,i absolutely love this echo.  the sound is fantastic!  i tell everyone i know with an echo dot to get this echo if they like playing music.  the sound is better than my bose speaker!
3205,14,even though this is the 2nd genaration.it is the 1st for me.i am loving this to bad i waited so long to try.but i am glad that i did.
3206,14,"this little speaker has great sound, it works well for background music, bass response is impressive for a little speaker and goes fairly loud for it is size.microphone pics up sound from as much as 25 feet away. my wife likes it so much, she wants one for our bathroom. we got it on sale for $80 during christmas."
3207,3,"i love mine, all pluses, +++++"
3208,12,i love this product! that is all i gotta say.
3209,0,"this is my 2nd echo.  i got this one for my office.  it woks well.  as with my other echo, it seems to have trouble understanding at times, but you just need to repeat the request and it seems to get it.  would have given it 5 stars but for this having to repeat the request some times."
3210,0,"alexa is great !! she tells me jokes, plays games, tells me  the weather & can answer most questions. i also like being able play my music on alexa & it has a great sound.i¡¯m somewhat concerned about her reaction to tv ads & shows that mention her name, it woke  her up & she actually played a song that the ¡°tv show¡± asked their alexa to play. i hope she does not start ordering things !!"
3211,14,"amazing sound given the echo is compact size. also, it can easily be moved from room to room -- just unplug it in one room and plug it in in another."
3212,10,"love it,love it ,love it! nice to play music of all kinds with just a quick command. or ask a question. do not know how i lived without this!"
3213,10,we love our alexa! the speakers are really quite good when it plays music. it is fun to ask questions for immediate info. we also play some of the games with our grandkids. the shopping list option is so handy!
3214,1,great new speaker in a compact design
3215,14,i use it for listening to music. just tell it what you want and it plays. also connected a bluetooth speaker to use remotely and worked fine.
3216,14,"the echo is ability to respond to voice requests, and audio sound is great for a speaker of it is size. if it had google is access to global information it would be excellent."
3217,12,love love it...find new ways to use it every day
3218,14,great sound (a little flat on bass) alexa hears me throughout our first floor. even coming down the stairs! still learning (both of us)
3219,14,pretty cool but pretty pointless.. i mainly bought it for music but in order to play a specific song you must purchase amazon is music service. i went ahead and did so but alexia constantly does not recognize the song i am looking for. i do like the sound quality but that is about it. i still find myself using google assist from my phone and think my money would of been better spent on a nice bluetooth speaker.
3220,11,"well, to me the sound is not improved, i prefer the first generation for music listening. the 1st has more filling bass and overall fuller for music."
3221,14,"excellent device, easy setup, loads of useable helpful skills, great sounding speaker, and alexa is just plain fun to use. the speech recognition is amazingly accurate. for all you get the price is unbeatable. the knowledge base is impressive and the response time is immediate with no lag. how does it work so fast? i have yet to request a song or an album that alexa has not immediately found."
3222,14,finally graduated from the dot to the echo 2nd gen. am very impressed with the sound quality and overall value in such a small size. what a great device and i¡¯m looking forward to seeing how amazon continues to develop the platform.
3223,14,wish i would have purchased a long time ago.linked all my wifi bulbs and outlet to it.i feel myself getting lazier with every command :)
3224,9,"this was given to my wife as a gift for christmas gift and we absolutely love it. the sound is quit impressive for it is size and really fills the area that it is in. i use it for cooking, timers and recipes. be able to use alexa to keep our shopping list is really cool considering we can be forgetful. we loved it so much we bought an echo dot for our bedroom."
3225,14,"it has very good sound; however, the set-up and pairing is somewhat complex. it required a call to the echo technician to finally get it to work"
3226,9,i bought this as an early christmas present for my family and  my whole family loves the echo !!! it is great for all ages and sounds great too. we are so happy we purchased it.  i actually bought one for my 80 year old parents and they love it also. best gift ever !!!
3227,14,i have two echo dots and adore them.  my only complaint was the lack of volume if i wanted to listen to music or my audible books.  i ordered this because of the positive reviews regarding the volume and sound quality.. i have not been disappointed!!! love my echo (2nd generation) and will definitely be purchasing another for my family and also keep it in mind for gifts!
3228,14,it good but the speaker sounds a bit wack after about 75-80% of volume capacity and sometimes it will not just listen to you technically you have to yell to it so it heard you.
3229,0,"i like that i can speak to alexa and she does what i ask.......sometimes. sometimes. even though i clearly say her name and clearly make my requests, she does not respond. for example, i am having a lot of trouble getting her to turn off around 6am in the morning after she has been on for about 15 minutes. she ignores me. when i try to turn her off manually that does not work either. finally i have to just unplug her. these problems are the downside for me with alexa."
3230,1,great product and the sound on this one is amazing. highly recommend this product
3231,14,"extremely difficult to activate had to call a computer friend to actually hook it up, and the tunes on board were limited so now i am paying$4.00 a month for more music.  good sound when it can find the music. would i recommend to a friend, no not unless they were very tech knowledgeable."
3232,10,"i love the convenience and speed which i can get answers to questions at, play music, set timers when cooking and check weather forecasts. echo does so much!"
3233,10,"i like it a lot,  sound is very good.  responds to my voice  from 10 feet away.  getting my home set up for automation.  loving it."
3234,5,bought as a gift
3235,14,actually bought three.  returned all by one since i do not have internet service and connecting to my phone hotspot was too tedious.
3236,9,"we gave our daughter, in college, an echo for christmas and decided we needed one for our house too. very nice design and works great."
3237,0,"i bought the echo as a gift for my wife but she heard that it is was intrusive and did not want to use it because of privacy issues that she has.  i kept it, and i am learning how to use it.  i uspect that it can function in ways that i have yet to learn."
3238,14,"update:  got through the glitches with the music.  she no longer shuts down, and continues to do everything i need without a problem.  very glad i bought this..i just bought this echo on black friday so it is brand new.  first off i love alexa.  she does almost everything i ask, however, i only gave it 3 stars for the one issue i have.  if it were not for this issue she would def get 5 stars from me.  so my issue is alexa will only play music for an hour to an hour an a half and shuts down.  is this normal?  if it is it is disappointing.  so, after she shuts down i will tell her to play sirius xm again.. the light spins..nothing.  so i will ask her just to play amazon music... light spins.. nothing.  we go through  this a few times and nothing.  i will go back to questions and games, she will answer, she will play.  i go back to music she will tell me she is connecting to the last station i was listening to on sirius xm... then nothing.  same with amazon music.  i end up having to unplug her, wait and hope she will play the music again.  after a bit, she will, but again it does not last before she shuts the music down and only respond to commands of questions and games.  if this is not normal i would like to replace her, but if it is normal,  i am completely disappointed.  how do i contact customer service to ask?  i do not see anything in the limited directions the echo came with"
3239,14,"once we got through the initial confusion with my wife and i both using it and our accounts getting switched on/off, we love it.  i doubt that we have tried even 10% of  its capabilities."
3240,9,"i bought alexa for my blind 95 year old father who recently lost his wife.  we are very happy with what she can do.  this is a godsend for the blind as you scan listen to books, music and search the internet."
3241,11,sound is muffled. not room filling as advertised. often i can not tell which singer i¡¯m listening to. amazon can do much better!
3242,14,"awesome to ask alexa to play music, integrates with fire tv pretty nicely.  new skills being added weekly makes it more useful as time goes on"
3243,14,this was a christmas gift and they have it with full effect great speaker for music. alittle hard to find the connections to start but a couple easy steps did the trick. other then that fantastic speaker.
3244,14,i have been using echo dot first generation and i have been very happy with it. i mostly listen to news on it and lately started listening music which prompted me to upgrade to echo. i noticed that echo has too much bass which i can live with for music but not with news. voices are to hear at low volumes due to too much bass. i wish amazon gives us option to adjust the bass.
3245,14,"i have 2 echos. neither can receive several radio stations to which i regularly listen. i can, however, listen on the internet at the same time with my ipad and iphone. the echo says ¡°the station is not available at this time¡±.  i asked how to fix the problem on the alexa app. i was told to unplug and reload the echo. it did not fix the problem. i have not heard again from the ¡°service¡±. i recommend buying the google product."
3246,14,"sure the new bells and whistles are nice, and they work just fine on my first gen, and the responsiveness of gen 2 stinks. alexa needs a hearing aid."
3247,14,"echo is awesome. did not feel i needed and never got one until recently, but in an office or really anywhere it is fun to use and convenient with the voice controls. why spend $100+ on a speaker when you can get this for at the most 99$ and it does so much more."
3248,0,"it is fun to use.  we love the games she plays and the weather and news items that she reports.  we enjoyed her banter with her own super bowl commercial.  and we laugh at her silly jokes.we wish she would use a search engine to answer easier questions.  she tends to often answer with ""sorry, i do not that.""one must learn what kind of questions she will answer and then how to ask them in a way that will get her to answer that question."
3249,11,"this is a very good speaker. it is not as good as the original but a very close second and considering it is $80 cheaper than the original, that is completely forgivable."
3250,14,great product. integrates with out smart hub (wink) and can control all of our smart devices. loving the ability to listen to spotify through a great speaker in a small footprint.
3251,11,i started with two amazon dots and love them so i thought of getting the echo 2nd gen for better sound. the sound is much better but the echo 2nd seems to not hear as good as the dot. how ever i am very pleased with the echo.
3252,0,alexa is not very smart . seems we get more i dont know that one. or when we ask for a song she only gives us samples lol  google is much smarter .
3253,14,this is a fun product. we own the echo dot and use it often. new applications are added periodically making it more and more useful
3254,11,"i purchased this as a replacement for the original 1st generation echo.  it is a great item with many improvements, thank you amaon"
3255,14,"i had high hopes for it, but it is not worth it unless you are willing to pay a lot for the services. it also is not very smart when it come to answering easy questions like it is marketed to do. i do not recommend buying unless you live in a smart house (smart tv, smart thermostat, light, etc)."
3256,10,"i love alexa! could have used a few more suggested prompts to get me started. otherwise, perfect gift."
3257,10,"i like the convenience of being able to call upon alexa for alarms and information, but not happy with ease in which alexa picks up cues from tv."
3258,14,i do not know how i lived without her she gives me the weather report before i even get out of bed. i ask her all sorts of questions and sheresponds immediately. it took me about an hour or so to hook her up.as long as i did it step by step it worked. i was just skipping ahead andnot following in order how to hook her up. i think every home should have one. i have a friend that tried to cheaper version and said she did not llive up to my echo.
3259,14,"the 2nd generation echo is great. the voice commands are pretty intuitive and the speaker produces a great sound. it is not perfect. some of the integration with outside programs is lacking, and i wish some of the customized routines had more options. these are issues i am sure will be fixed with time. all in all, these is a great system."
3260,10,arrived on time! will get a lot of use
3261,11,"i have few complaints, the sound it produces for music is wonderful.i later bought a dot for the bedroom due to liking the echo"
3262,10,i love playing music with this device and receiving all kinds of information with voice command. it is good company and entertainment.
3263,14,"this is my first experience with the echo and alexa. this model is marketed with improved sound, but i feel that the sound is flat if not a tad too deep."
3264,10,"device is so much fun i can not stop talking to it. very useful for alarms, news and weather. great for music too especially with amazon music."
3265,11,alexa does not hear as well as the 1st generation. i also like the volume adjustment ring better on 1st generation.  otherwise same as older version
3266,14,"my husband is obsessed with alexa..... i would not be shocked if he kicks me out of bed so alexa can have my spot.no but really, this thing is pretty awesome. my husband has it set up to tell him the news and other things that he chose every morning. the speaker is actually pretty impressive too."
3267,8,alexa. rocks!
3268,0,fun and good product. alexa has trouble understanding requests and often says it cannot find music channels that have been played many times.
3269,11,"much better sound quality than the original version, if not up to the standards of sonos. it does much better hearing commands as well. with the old version, i often needed to repeat ¡°play venice classic radio.¡± no longer.set up was easy and i love the smaller size. still not as smart as google home, but now it sounds better at least (and looks better too)."
3270,14,i like it. fairly east to setup except the calling and app. you need at least android 5.0 to make calls and was disappointed it does not access my email
3271,10,alexa tell me a joke !!!! i love it !!!!!
3272,14,"entertaining and informative, i find the technology amazing - easy to track packages ordered from amazon.  one day, alexa  was blinking yellow and i did not know why.  when i looked it up, i realized to was for notifications and when i asked she told me a package from amazon had just delivered and low and behold, i checked at my door and there it was !"
3273,10,"i love her greeting every morning and the jokes are great. alexa has an answer for every question i ask.  the only thing that drove me crazy was the day i came home and echo was glowing a different color and it took more than ""20 questions"" to find out what it meant."
3274,0,"this is amazing technology overall. there is a lot alexa still does not know. and sometimes she will not respond right away. but again, overall we love alexa."
3275,11,very pleased with the 2nd gen echo!! i have a 1st gen as well...very pleased with the speaker link ability as well as the sound improvements. only thing i miss from the first gen is the volume buttons on the speaker itself. (2nd gen has buttons 1 gen had the sound wheel on top)
3276,10,very happy with my echo. our favorite thing to do is play song quiz and ask the ¡°question of the day¡±.great sound quality for such a small speaker.we bought smart plugs and they were easy to connect to alexa.
3277,11,"love the color of this, it blends nicely into our home decor. this echo is much more responsive than the echo plus i bought. do not get me started on the echo plus. anyway, the size, color and performance of this echo has been outstanding."
3278,0,i can turn the volume up and music sounds good. i am having trouble knowing which of or how to get my music selections or songscto play.  i have asked several questions and she does not know the answer. i think it was spainish translations too.
3279,14,"after the echo is set up no problem. it took more than half a dozen tries to complete the set-up, after that no problems or issues. if you enjoy music you will love the sound."
3280,14,i love this product.  it took a few tries to get it connected at home to my network but once connected it works as advertised.  i only use it for music and news through voice commands at this point but i intend to explore more features soon.  good sound quality and entertaining for folks that do not have one and especially those who have not heard of them.
3281,9,"this was a gift from my husband. i was not sure about it at first, but now i love it.  we love asking alexa to play music.  the sound is great."
3282,1,"i am really impressed with the sound quality of this product, ease of use, and selection of services offered. highly recommend purchasing one."
3283,10,"love love love the echo.  so easy to set up....the only thing...if you have echo playing and an ""alexa"" commercial comes on tv....she responds....it is funny.  the sounds is very stereo sounding.  i use it every day."
3284,11,"the 2nd generation echo is great, much more powerful.  has clear voice and just as easy as previous models.  i am however, dissapointed that it does not have a battery pack like the echo dot is do.  please make a battery pak for this beautiful item.  thanks"
3285,14,"this generation is better at picking up your voice from across the room but, the sound quality is poor. the vocals are murky to the point of being unintelligble and the audio is too base heavy.  i do not recommend it if you want to listen to music."
3286,14,"only negative, does not work as an intercom if you do not have a cell phone. that is the reason i bought two in the first place. other than that, i¡¯ve love it. i use it every day. got the cheaper echo music service.update: i do not know if it is because i updated ios or what, but i can now drop in between echos with no cell phone. googled but did not see any news articles saying the feature was enhanced. so now i¡¯m 6 stars happy."
3287,0,best thing about this for me is the music. quality is great. alexa however has a hard time understanding a lot of things and it gets frustrating.
3288,0,"great sound, works as espected except for the fact that you must used plugged in to the wall and is completely impossible to find a battery for this item..."
3289,10,the sound is great!  easy to set up and still amazed by being able to tell alexa to play the music i like.  perfect for listening in my study!
3290,14,very disappointed in the new echo that was supposed to have improved sound. as others have noted it is significantly worse sounding than the original. i bought the original on day one and have two of them and i bought a three pack of these expecting improvement of sound and yet they are far worse. if you are expecting an upgrade over the original in this ¡°second generation¡± device then you are out of luck. i guess i¡¯m going to have to try the pro version which sucks because i really liked the new design.
3291,0,"its ok. messes up a lot to where she has to restart or reboot. i like asking for news updates and it goes through a lot of the current news. also plays radio stations right now, which is nice. overall it is ok."
3292,10,"great sound!  i love listening to my favorite radio station on tune-in on the echo, but am having trouble figuring out what else we can do on it."
3293,14,"after a little problem getting it set up (my fault -- inadequate wifi), it works like a charm.  helpful and useful.  surprisingly good quality sound when playing music."
3294,11,it works better than i expected. the sound quality is excellent. i am considering purchasing a second unit for another room in my house.
3295,10,i like how quick it is to respond and how it can hear you from other rooms in the house. it is also so convenient to have such a wealth of knowledge at your fingertips.
3296,10,"already had an echo plus, adding this was super easy.  love the sound quality.  it is cool to have music in different parts of the house. the wood finish fits the room it is located.  happy we got this!"
3297,0,"great product, but do not give it someone named alexa :)  someone told me that you could change name, but did not need to as no one named alexa."
3298,14,"the sound is arguably a little difficult to tell that it is much better. it seems to recognize my voice better than the old generation. it is a bit frustrating that you can not have multiple zones to play music that link to multiple echos. i have three echos, one downstairs, two upstairs, and you can not have a setting to play just the ones upstairs and a setting to play all of them. once an echo has been assigned it cannot join another group."
3299,14,"just say alexia alexia and poof... seriously, a great buy that can add some joy to your household, between great sound, apps, and all the extras i personally would suggest this buy to everyone!"
3300,0,so far so good. mt wife uses it more than i do. the only complaint that i have is sometimes when i request a song/music i only get a sample.
3301,0,"the echo is great. whenever i have a question, it is there to answer. i do not like, however, that it is not compatible with my free accounts. i understand everybody is out to make a buck, but sometimes it is just too much. i heart radio plays, but my spotify account is incompatible because i do not pay for it. it is frustrating. other than that, my echo is great. i can order things from it. i ask it many questions. it is interactive and i love it."
3302,9,"great product, arrived on time and was very simple to set up.  the sound is actually better than i expected.  my kids have this in their room and it is a perfect fit for young ones looking for music and more."
3303,3,love this thing. works so well
3304,10,this little thing is amazing!  i love being able to add things to our shopping cart then whoever is at the store can access it from their phone.
3305,10,"alexa is my alarm clock and plays lots of music for me...  she sometimes plays dumb, and says she does not have that information,  it is all in the way you ask.  my grandchildren love her."
3306,9,"actually, my niece got me this for christmas. i was not sure what it even was at first but it is become one of the best things i own. even the cat loves it!"
3307,14,i love being able to control my home with this. the music is a bonus. my only complaint is that it is so sensitive that even when not in use if someone says 'alexa' it turns on.
3308,14,i cant get it to connect to wi-fi - i tried at my office and at home.  i am super disappointed.  i got an echo show for my son and that works great.  i am going to be returning my echo. boo.
3309,14,"nice style. still learning about it. set up was not as easy as people said. i¡¯ve googled it, youtube it, etc. still working on alexa being my ¡° friend ¡°"
3310,14,very disappointed that it does not support alarms and reminders. no documentation of how to enable that feature. i assume like most things that there is a charge for this.  that was one of the primary reasons for purchase. my wife and i are older and need the assistance to help remember things.  however it is certainly entertaining to fool with. intend to purchase accessories that will enable control of lights and some other fixtures.
3311,12,just okay
3312,9,this is my first echo and i must say i and the whole family just  love it! we use it everyday for everything and are always finding new things to try. i even got my father one for his birthday and a 3 month sub to prime.
3313,14,"great sound.  still learning other uses.  had a great deal of difficulty pairing it with pandora, but it has been super once that onstacle was overcome.  playing music several hours per day."
3314,0,meh kind of annoying. have to use it constantly to get her used to what you are saying. she still misunderstand and does not have alot of useful functions
3315,10,totally love my echo!  everyday i¡¯m finding new things that alexa can do to assist me with my daily living. highly recommend echo!
3316,14,"lots to like about the echo. my only concern is that the volume goes up and down depending on the song. when playing music overnight, this hinders restful sleep."
3317,14,"did not know it was plug in only with no 2nd generation batteries back up,they have first gen and 2nd gen echo dot should have read more on it!"
3318,10,this is my first echo and i love it!! the style is sleek and blends in perfectly with the rest of my apartment. alexa is easy to use and easy to set up. the alexa app is so easy to set up and i like that you can see what you have asked. my favorite thing to use alexa for is quick recipes without having to pick up my phone!
3319,0,"we are enjoying this addition to our home.  there are a lot of features like news, weather, timers, reminders, lists and the occasional joke that we will use regularly.  it is a little frustrating that some questions that seem fairly basic are not able to be answered since there is not much internet content available (hopefully that will change).  overall, we are enjoying having music and other information available with just a simple spoken request."
3320,14,i use echo with my 4 wemo smart plugins and it works great most of the time. sometimes i have to tell alexa a couple of times to operate devices.
3321,11,smaller than our first gen echo but still has the same quality of sound and seems to pick up commands better. absolutely love our echo devices.
3322,10,i really enjoy alexa as my assistant! 2 dots an echo as of now. i nonstop set up timers for the kids and play music. my son and i enjoy playing jeopardy and 20 questions. if you pay for prime this is just another way to maximize your membership.
3323,14,"sounds good but placement of unit for voice recognition is more critical than i would have thought. also, not everything can be set up via my windows 10 pc. i have to resort to my phone app for some items. overall, i like it and do recommend it."
3324,9,very happy with all the features and was so suprised how loud it get when listening to music.  a great product for a lazy man!
3325,14,sharp looking and cool light ring distract from inability to connect to network.  with perseverance it might have worked but it really was not worth it since it does not play in the sandbox with my apple music and sonos integration is in beta.  controlling our new fans and some light bulbs would be cool but not worth the shameless self-promotion and encouragement to purchase more stuff i probably do not need from amazon.
3326,9,best item i ever purchased along with the echo dot!
3327,10,"interesting product. still learning all of the capabilities alexa can bring our way. use it pretty much every day, mostly for background music and the occasional question or two relating to just about anything!"
3328,9,this echo was a christmas gift and i love how easy it is to use it.  i probably would not have bought it for myself because i would have thought it to be too complicated.
3329,10,"what are like the most about this is that it responds immediately to my voice. i do not have to repeat myself as i did with my google home. another great feature for me, is the fact that i¡¯ve been a siriusxm subscriber for over 12 years now and i can get my siriusxm through alexa. the shopping list is convenient. just blurting something out instead of forgetting about it or what you were going to say is convenient. i love it."
3330,10,"easy to set up, fun to use.  alexa through the echo is great.  just ask her to play any type of music, ask her just about any question, but do not forget to tell her thank you...lol. this is a great invention and is very reasonably priced.  i am pleasantly surprised by just how much this little device can do."
3331,11,i have a first gen and a dot and am pleased with the update. i think the sound is slightly better but i felt the first gen was super to begin with. the fabric cover is nice but just wished that the wood grain and fabric were all priced the same. i sorta miss the volume spin top from the first gen but overall an very satisfied with it.
3332,1,very small and good
3333,9,i absolutely love echo in all shapes and sizes.  i bought almost everyone i had to buy for this holiday season one.  they are the perfect gift.
3334,14,"i liked the sound of the first generation echo, but this one is a delight. find myself listening eagerly to classical music. not usually my first choice."
3335,10,alexa is amazing! i listen to music again all of the time! it is so convenient to just ask alexa the weather and news each morning while i am getting ready. best $80 i ever spent!
3336,14,"the device is great.  it does what it is supposed to do.  voice control plays music, sets timers, looks up things on the internet.  artificial intelligence pretty good.  the app is so slow that it limits what would have been a 5-star device.  what good is it to add milk to my shopping list if it takes 10 minutes to bring up the shopping list when i need it?"
3337,14,an awsome idea. i truly enjoy my echo. i love it ! it really is so helpful. theres so much alexa can do. the possibilities are endless. or you can keep it simple .. basic.. totally your choice..i own an echo 2nd gen. along with many items that work with alexa..and an e. dot 2nd gen. i also bought 6 of my 11 grandchildren each an e. dot 2nd gen. i plan to keep adding on .
3338,14,i am really glad i spent the extra 20 bucks and got this one. sound is great and now my stereo gets less use. a bit disappointed alexa can not find waylon jennings though.the only improvement would be if it could be used without the power cord for outdoor summer use
3339,9,my daughter and son-in-law got this for us for christmas. i love it!. i use it a lot for a timer and to play music and get the weather. i would not be with out it now.
3340,10,"really excellent. my wife and son loved it. do not need to go online to check the weather, movie times, news, play music, and set reminder for sleeping, events, and etc."
3341,10,"bought this for my husband for his birthday.  he loves the fact that it plays the music he really likes and gives him the scores of games, etc."
3342,11,"it is great but not 5 stars, could just be me but the music just sounds slightly better with my old one."
3343,14,not very responsive.  i feel like i argue with alexa more than i do my kids.  i bought 2 and a dot. and it was to make life easier.  it did not.  it made it more complicated. and worst part...i threw away the packaging so i can not return them. stuck with alexa.
3344,11,i like the sound of the larger one better but the price and performance of this 2nd gen is great. you need one in every room.
3345,14,love this cup. fruit is completely infused in the water because the storage tube extends to almost the bottom of the cup unlike others that have it only at the top. easy to assemble and carry with you.
3346,14,prior to purchasing i was not sure if i¡¯d really enjoy it but it was on sale and i said what the heck....i must say i¡¯m really impressed with echo and it is capabilities. i also purchased the echo dot but i could not get it going due to needing an firmware update and just sat it aside. it is currently still sitting aside <f0><u+009f><u+0099><u+0081>. just been to busy to mess with it and almost wish i would have just purchased two of the echo is while they were on sale.
3347,14,love the enriched sound of echo over echo dot.  i¡¯m discovering new things to do with it every day.  wish there was an opportunity to choose a male voice (alex?) with australian accent like i have for my siri.
3348,14,"never listens. takes forever to respond. disconnects for no reason and fails to reconnect. sometimes when the alarm goes off, it is impossible to turn off. i would pay money if it meant i could erase the rage caused by this pile of trash."
3349,14,greets deal for $85. not as good as my bose mini but it cost $200. if you are ok with a wired speaker this is a great deal. i talk to alexa more than my wife.
3350,10,"we mainly use it to play amazon prime unlimited music, but like asking alexa about news and weather.  great speakers and you can even tell it to make it louder (also has a manual volume control). awesome invention!"
3351,9,"it is easy, pretty, and sound quality is excellent.  (worth the extra few dollars over the dot.)  this is our first one.  what took us so long !?!"
3352,0,it is a nice speaker and is hands-free. it does make lists for you but other than that unless you have a smart connected house it does not do much else.
3353,4,yes!!! sound is great!!
3354,14,"got one for me and my 88 yr old mother. we both love echo. having easy access to different music has picked up my mom is spirits. life is looking better.would like to be able to both stream from my amazon prime account. not sure if that is what is causing problems for us - ""streaming on another device"". i am now accessing music via my pandora acct - seems to resolved the problem. any way for us to both stream concurrently from amazon music?"
3355,14,nice sound.  fun to use.  not user friendly for setting up and programming.  limited instructions.  finally figured it out on my own.
3356,11,works amazingly well - we love it - sound is good considering it has a 4 inch diameter.
3357,14,"alexa is a great lil companions if you will, again needs updated. could not tell you about shopping thru her, cause i do not luse that feature,"
3358,9,"this was for my 95 year old mom, who is in assisted living.  the first time she said ""alexa, play back home again by john denver"" and it worked, she has such a cool smile come across her face.  of course, half the time she calls her ""alexus"", but it still works..."
3359,14,just love alexa. she keeps me company when no one else is around. love the quality of the speaker. actually sounds better than my bose
3360,11,"coming from the amazon tap, i am very happy with the improved sound quality.  i can not compare to things like sonos or the echo plus, but i would put it on par with a decent portable stereo.  looks nice on my shelf, too (gray fabric model)."
3361,9,it was gift for my family. we love it. my 14 yo checks the weather in the morning. my 3 year old has song requests all by himself.
3362,14,"i have only used mine a couple times to play music and it was great, but now it plays a couple seconds on one song then changes songs. the volume would go up and down by itself and it turned on a light in the middle of the night. i am going to return it and try again. i will update again once i get the new one."
3363,14,"its great walking into the house and having electonics and lights on voice control! first world problem, dont keep it too close to the tv speakers or advertisements will set it off! haha"
3364,11,omg i had the old echo dot i can not believe how incredible this sounds now. very happy with this purchase. i definitely would recommend this
3365,11,love my echo.  it is great having something so small in the kitchen.  volume and clarity of out put is great. no complaints at all.
3366,14,"not 100 % in voice recognition, but it does very well.lets me keep my lazy butt sitting down or in bed and can controll thermostats, etcmusic with prime is real nice now"
3367,9,"this is probably one of the best devices on the market today, i purchase the echo as christmas and birthday gifts everyone of my children love it. being able to contact one another just by using our voices is amazing."
3368,14,this device is cute and sort of fun.  it plays music okay.  it is not anything spectacular and is not going to change your life.  just adds a little convenience to some routine tasks.
3369,10,this along with some home automation items has really changed the culture at our house and the way we go about daily life..... super buy..... o and the grandkids love it too lol
3370,10,alexa is amazing and a sign of what technology is come to i really enjoy this product and constantly trying to find uses for it
3371,10,"the echo has such a nice sound for playing music! i love the many things that you can ask alexa, and she knows most all of the answers. it is great fun!"
3372,14,"i hate technology and was fundamentally against a robot servant in my house initially, but alexa has changed my mind. the drop-in feature is great to let my teenager know that dinner is almost ready without having to venture into the black hole she calls a bedroom. i have not delved into smart home stuff yet, but the app makes it look pretty easy, so soon my house might be closer to george jetson is than fred flintstone is."
3373,0,"this product is so frustrating. alexa rarely gets requests right. unless you saying the artists name and song, she will not know what you¡¯re saying. even simple requests such ¡°play top hits music¡± is not clear enough. i also do not like that it must be plugged in to work. if you¡¯re wanting portability this is not the product for you. i gave it two stars just because the sound quality is pretty good and it can still be used as a simple bluetooth speaker."
3374,0,integrates with some other smart devices. does not always 'get' what you ask it to do - i usually get better results with my android phone and google. does have a pretty nice speaker for such a small device - music sounds nice on it.
3375,1,fun toy
3376,14,"once i got it synced with my computer yes, i like it. i have to take it elsewhere however, i have a spouse that does not want to listen to the music :-("
3377,14,"great sound verses the google model. it is handy in our master bath for music, news, weather and also love the timer feature. i am ready on time now. very easy to sink with our sonos music system."
3378,0,"works great, easy to use and setup, only problem is if it is close to the tv and someone says the name ""alexa"", it will respond"
3379,14,"i love this little device in my kitchen!  we are all enjoying it - especially the ""good morning, alexa"" feature.  the only thing i do not care for is that it stops playing of its own accord at times, but i think that might be because it is getting tripped on the wireless with all of the other dot devices we have scattered through the house."
3380,0,"does not access my imac music library on request. so i can not just ask her to play a song or playlist. it does have a good speaker and i can control it through my iphone. she does frequently try to sell me amazon services which i am not interested in. she will tell me the weather, answer many questions, etc.. which is nice."
3381,10,"alexa has become a part of our family.  answers most of our questions.  it does not come with a manual, you have buy it separate.  it is fun."
3382,14,"i went through two of these because alexa just wigs out after a few weeks on both.  and when it did work, it was just okay."
3383,1,"nice, clear sound"
3384,12,"this is awesome!  still learning all the things it can do, but we use it every day.  sound is pretty good.  very happy with this purchase."
3385,12,"still learning about all the things the echo can do, but so far it is great. the sound quality is very good and it is very responsive to voice commands."
3386,8,love love love
3387,11,"i have 3 echo is. the first 2 were gen one. one for myself and one for my daughter. this 2nd gen one i bought for my kitchen, and it works as expected. the only reason it gets 4 start is because they removed the volume ring control on the top of the unit. the gen 1 is you could adjust the volume manually. with this one, you can not. i miss that feature."
3388,14,it is a good product but closed. only can ear music from amazon music but what happen if i can ear from youtube only using my voice? i can use app from my iphone but the idea is using directly from alexa.another things is the battery. why i need buy an accesory?the idea is cool but you things an future integration.in the future another company make open plataform and you lose markets.thanks for readme.
3389,10,"i use amazon echo devices on a daily basis.  i love being able to ask alexa the time, weather, news, etc.  but even more its so convenient to ask alexa to add items or events to my shopping and to-do list is.  i use alexa to set reminders, alarms, timers and more.  amazon echo devices control my home as well, turning on and off lights, adjusting the temperature, etc.  just wish i could afford a couple amazon show devices, that would be nice."
3390,10,"i received my echo for christmas and could not wait to get it up and running! my son has one and i loved visiting him. he always has sweet sounds of music lofting in the air thanks to his echo. i wake each morning and ask, ""alexa start my day"". she gives me  my weather, top news stories and traffic conditions for my work commute. i love my alexa! it is not just a radio!"
3391,12,"to be honest, i wasnt sure how this thing would work but it is awesome!  we do not use it to it is potential but we enjoy playing games and listening to music.  we finally figured out how to use it with dish, works great!"
3392,0,"the echo works just as we hoped it would.  it recognizes my voice without fault, answers questions, and plays music requests. it is great."
3393,10,"i have really enjoyed this gift from my son.  i am still discovering all it can do.  once we get the television and other items connect i am sure i will love it more.  you can make calls, send texts, make lists and of course my favorite - play music."
3394,9,"i received a 2nd generation echo as a christmas gift, not even wanting one honestly; however,  i truly enjoy having one! for the echo does many different skills that i was not aware of! the sound quality is my best feature!  i truly recommend purchasing 1 or asking for one for a gift! :-)"
3395,9,have the first alexa and love it.  so i purchased the second one for my upstairs bedroom.  the second generation sound so much better and it is smaller.  love both of them
3396,10,"love everything about it!  streaming news, endless music library and comprehensive encyclopedia on demand. what else could you ask for?"
3397,10,"still learning how to use it but so far it is been great. lots of fun asking questions, interesting facts; playing music. very handy. also to check my calendar and delivery notifications."
3398,10,"it is great, my wife used it every day and really enjoys it."
3399,10,"oue family loves amazon echo.  we love the sound quality,  multi room music ability,  dropping in on rooms and everything else she can do."
3400,10,absolutely love it. great volume and alexa continues to have more and more things added. still learning how to sync all the smart devices. it was not as easy as we were hoping.
3401,10,easy to set up and use.  just beginning to scratch the surface on all the things that it can do fot us.  highly recommend!
3402,14,"a wonderful addition to my kitchen.  i use it for music, questions (basketball score), making calls, reminders, timers and more.  not high end speakers, but decent enough for its size (can be easily hooked up to s better sound system if desired.  overall, it exceeds my expectations."
3403,14,it does not recognize my commands well.takes 3 times and i have to end up yelling which is counter productive to having a convenient voice activated device.software needs upgrades and you should be able to name it something else. i could go on and on.. its a novel gimmick.. not a technological breakthrough.. you have to realize it before you buy it.
3404,14,"i bought this echo to replace an echo 1st generation(door stop now, would never stay connected to wifi). hey can i exchange it for an echo dot?seriously."
3405,14,the speakers are fantastic. i bought it hoping that they would be so i did not have to buy separate bluetooth speakers. very pleased.
3406,10,i honestly went in with very low expectations and i could not have been more wrong. i love how i can request music on demand. the audible books are fantastic as well. i also purchased some smart plugs for a couple outlets in my home. it is super cool to be able to turn lights on and off using alexa. i highly recommend this product
3407,14,"i do like with the bigger units sound quality over 'the dot""........the item performed perfectly for about 2 weeks, and then out of no where alexa began to turn red when trying to talk to her. you would ask her a question and she would turn on then she would shut off without answering back.......adding items to a list she would not respond....etc. the product seems to be taking a nose dive and for almost $90.00 that is disapointing"
3408,1,has good sound
3409,9,"these are fun. have echos in master bath, bedroom, living room and kitchen. used primarily for music and smart home controls."
3410,0,"the sound is the best, i would have given it a perfect score but it will not work with my echo, there has to be something i need to do i just have not figured it out yet."
3411,9,"super happy with this little device. great for entertainment and works great with our hue bulbs, nest other smart devices in the house!"
3412,14,"i like the fact that it understands most commands. what is very disappointing is that it does not connect with my tv, and to date, with two systems one on each floor, i cannot connect them to my direct tv"
3413,10,"love my alexa echo. it is helpful and also fun. we use it for a timer, weather and news, music, and just for fun little things that it can do."
3414,11,i am giving this a 3 as i moved my echo v1 to the bathroom and wanted this one in the kitchen since it has more microphones and i thought it would listen better. it does listen better. the sound is not as good as the original echo. maybe a echo plus will replace this one someday.
3415,11,great device with excellent sound for the price.  recognizes instructions from across the room.  we have echo dots in all of the  bedrooms but for the living room the echo was a must have.  also like the heather gray and the fact that you can change the covers.
3416,14,"it cannot say dinah... it will do a command several days in a row then totally misunderstand it for the next 10 days.  as long as you do not expect it to work or understand you....you¡¯ll love it.  yeah, right"
3417,11,i have the original echo and love it ... i like this newest version ... with smaller profile and bigger sound even better!
3418,14,my first echo . have to say at first appears to be an  impressive device  . has very little learning curve to it i. linked to your smart phone its application  you can enable all kinds of everyday things to ask alexa  news weather sports . i listen to spotify with it  you have to have a premium account  to play anythjing you desire . i use it to access pinterest when im in the kitchen for recipes . it is a very trainable device  with time and patience this can be very useful once they fix the issues  . a hub im told is required to control such things as outside lights and your thermostat . im am not impressed with it .  it says it continues to learn as you use it  most of the time it does not know what you are saying or plays the wrong thing also if you use spotify premium it does not play songs you have saved in your library ( premium users only) . i do not see any reason for you to buy the numerous books they hawk on here on how to use it . note !!!! these develop glitches and problems and when you try and return it to their overseas speaking people who have no command of everyday english are plain down right rude in chat thinking everyones a moron . i gave up trying to return this as i told them i was housebound and could not get out .amazon is all about big money and little customers mean nothing to them  do not try and argue with their stupidity  they do not understand your problem . amazon needs to start thinking about its customers and not its profits
3419,10,lots of fun and informative. we subscribed to music unlimited and use it for music everyday. my son has a google home mini and it is much better on answering direct questions than alexa. there are lots of apps for the alexa that you can enable that does help get better results on your questions. also learning how to ask what you want to know makes a difference on your results. fun to try and ask questions that make her answer with silly replies.
3420,14,"alexa has become a faithful friend, finding and playing music instantly, reporting on the local weather, and reading the local news. that is only a part of all the things alexa can do to amuse or entertain, serve as a virtual assistant, or even shop."
3421,14,"this was a gift for my son. i am impressed with it so far in that the list price has come down to about half what it was, and the included components are designed to be higher fidelity. what i think will be its most useful asset is the addition of a line out so that it can be connected to an amplifier and speakers."
3422,14,the echo still has a ways to go before i would say it is very useful.  it is more of a glorified light switch or ac controller.
3423,14,not as connective as i would have thought. the app is not very good at all. it is useful but i would prefer to wait for the screen one to go down in price. they make it seem as if you can use it without it being plugged into a power source. that is not the case. it must always be plugged in in order for it to work. it is a hyped up round siri that can act as an alarm. the connectivity is not nearly as good as i had assumed. it is ok.
3424,10,"do not use it much, but have fun playing my fav music.  and asking it questions. use it as a timer, and an alarm.  i recommend it!"
3425,14,"it is awesome and super easy yo use. my 6 year old daughter uses it everyday to listen to her favorite children is music and books. the sound is a perfect balance of highs and lows; something i would expect from bose. if you are on the fence about buying this, just do it, you will noy be disappointed."
3426,14,"love gen 1, this gen 2 not so much. when music is loud and i say ""alexa"" and it should pause to hear my command, it stops for a split second and instantly resumes every time.  also seems laggier than the first generation. i returned it."
3427,10,it is everything that you want - we love it for the music and for some little tidbits of things.  it came well packaged and was very easy to set up.
3428,14,i liked the oak surround ( i wish i could stain it to match my woodwork). the sound is better then expected especially for daily listening  my only disappointment is with the ai of alexa. she could not always understand my questions or provide the correct answer. i expect amazon will improve this overtime and the product will improve with futur firmware updates.
3429,14,i love this! the only regret i have is that i bought the dot for it as well....and have not used it at all. not worth returning though since they charge you to return things.
3430,14,loving it so far. my boyfriend has a really deep voice and it has no problem keeping up with both of us. the sound quality is excellent as well.
3431,14,"love it. having a blast. phillips hue kit, tplink ac plugs, and a logitech harmony hub coming today. i got echo gen2, dot gen2, and two fire tv boxes."
3432,11,great sound quality. well made no doubt.
3433,11,never thought i would use it as much as i do but it a very convenient and handy gadget and the sound quality is excellent. would recommend.
3434,9,we have the original which we love and this is for my daughter at college and it is perfect-plus it pairs with her new turntable.
3435,14,"alexa is terrific.  we only use it for music.  we call up songs and musicians from our past going back to the 1930 is.  alexa is amazing with her resources and has only failed on about three requests.  one was ""everything is up to date in kansas city"" by john charles thomas, the original hit long before the movie ""oklahoma.""  her most amazing was ""at a little hot dog stand"", by dick todd circa 1933."
3436,14,worked for a good hour and then stopped responding to my voice. tried to figure out how to fix it from the lame instructions and the best i could come up with was press the button on the top of the control panel to make it respond. but i have to hold the button down while i speak. my google phone works better than this thing does.
3437,10,"so far, our family loves the ease of playing music and getting answers to questions.  we love playing question of the day, but alexa often does not understand our answer."
3438,10,i have 3 amazon echos around the house and the music sounds great!  also have them controling the lights.  can also ask her to check the status of your amazon orders.  and now working on open control using a wemo d1 mini esp8266 card. the amazon alexa is an amazing product!
3439,11,"i thought the first generation was pretty good, but the second-generation you can deftly hear the difference in quality,"
3440,11,i miss the volume ring.
3441,11,i love this item! i also like the fact that they are always coming up with new commands for alexa! the speaker quality is excellent also!
3442,0,"i like that i¡¯m able turn my lights on and off. i like my brief morning news. i believe that the ai is still missing a lot of information. i¡¯ve ask alexa several things that she said i do not know the answer to that, where siri was able to give me an answer right away. i also do not like that if it is connected to a bluetooth, it cannot also utilize its own speaker when i asl alexa to play music everywhere. otherwise, amazing product."
3443,14,"some connection issues, thought it was with our wifi. double checked wifi and everything is good with it, but echo goes in search mode (blue ring) and turns off immediately and will not turn on unless unplug and replug it echo back"
3444,14,"oh, where to start¡¦ i love most things about my echo.  i love the sound quality, the information she provides and the drop in feature among other things. it is just a bit hurtful/frustrating that she does not recognize my voice. i¡¯ve done the voice recognition set up several times and more often than not she has no idea who i am¡¦weep weep <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0094>."
3445,1,very pleased
3446,9,i purchased this for myself for christmas and was totally surprised at all it does.  i love that i can play just about every genre of music without purchasing it and the sound is awesome.  will be buying another for my office.
3447,14,"echo is the greatest thing since chocolate ice cream.  but, do not raise the price.  and, i would love to take alexa out for dinner and a movie."
3448,14,so far the new alexa is meeting my expectations. if you do not have one you will find it fun and also very helpful.
3449,10,"i do not know how i lived without my echo. love playing games while cleaning or doing dishes.... keeps me occupied and learning, and connects so easily with audible."
3450,9,i got it as a gift and i like it - simplifies getting the temp and weather everyday.  i am sure once i have a chance to explore all the possibilities i will enjoy it even more :^).
3451,9,ordered as a gift loved it so much i order one for myseld.
3452,14,i was so impressed with the sound of this device that i purchased a second one so i did not have to keep moving it from room to room.
3453,1,this thing is fun!
3454,0,"sometimes i must ask the question incorrectly so i get no answer or an incorrect answer.  also, i do not know what her limitations are, i.e. alexsa,  translate (insert spanish word) into english,  answer from alexa is the spanish word repeated"
3455,14,"i really like this thing. has great sound. would be nice to have her start out a bit quieter, but that is not a big problem. easy to use."
3456,10,"my best friend and daughter love alexa. i have not been able to connect to the internet with mine, but i keep trying. i will get it soon."
3457,10,"i love this echo!  as an older adult, i like to have reminders so i do not forget to keep an appointment or pick up something at the store.  also, i am a slow learner when it comes to using text options and apps on my iphone.  with the echo, alexa adds items to my calendar and to my shopping list, so i can quickly check for things i have to do, and items for which i need to shop."
3458,14,"it was a bitch to set up for some reason. i bought this for my mom. anyway, once it finally was setup, alexa has been doing her thang. granted, she does not understand caribbean accents too well..."
3459,14,this is our first echo product and we could not be happier. it is easy to set up and easy for my children (4 and 2) to as to play music.i never had a eco 1st generation - but i see no issues with the sound volume or clarity.i would recommend to friends and family.
3460,14,"i do really like the concept, and i subscribed to amazon music unlimited.  what i do not care for is alexa is voice.  it is very ""bass"", which makes her a bit hard to understand.  i hope there will be some kind of ""fix"" for this in the future.  the voice on a friend is google home unit is much clearer."
3461,10,i love alexa.  her interesting facts when i say good morning are very interesting.  looking forward to the smart home hookups in the future.
3462,14,"received my echo this morning.  it works fine and while doing my setup and looking up information, i discovered that i was charged $99 for my order and today the same echo is showing a price of $84.99.  have no idea how to ask amazon why my price is higher or how to get a credit for the difference."
3463,10,what a joy to use
3464,9,"i love love my echo...getting more, for upstairs and i want the one with the screen for the kit,hen so i can review recipes and lyrics....the possibilities are endless!!"
3465,10,"we use it a lot for controlling lights, checking temperatures and forecasts, as a timer, playing songs and for playing jeopardy!"
3466,14,yuck. was so excited for this. total let down on everything except appearances. worked poorly and sounded worse.
3467,9,"was a gift. he loves it, especially for his music. and as he commented, ""finally something in the house that listens to me."""
3468,11,got this after receiving a dot for christmas. the sound on this is great for such a small unit! well worth the upgrade!
3469,14,"works great, only wish there was a built in calendar thats not linked to gmail or microsoft products, only drawback. music plays beautifully, clear and crisp. information delivered is accurate and reminders are great!!!"
3470,14,had alittle difficulty setting alexa up so it would work with my different devices.  asking a few ?'s from friends & alittle help from my computer guy i finally got alexa to work.  the app that wks on my phone is not the app for use with my macbook pro.  confusing-should have been made clear in the set-up process.
3471,10,i love to say¡¯play spa music¡¯ and it is played! i listen to music nearly all day! it took me a short time to ¡®get it¡¯ when speaking to alexa but feel very comfortable asking for the music or the weather or a joke!
3472,0,"have only used for several weeks so am still learning the capabilities of it. asking questions takes some hit and miss attempts to elicit the correct response on how you word it. getting information you want can usually be accomplished, otherwise you get a ""i do not know that"" response. this is like using siri, or cortana but without using a phone or computer. a lot of potential and to learn yet but glad i have the echo."
3473,10,"having so much fun with alexa, especially like question of the day and the word game.  my great grand children ask her to tell them jokes.anxious to learn more and more as time goes on."
3474,10,such a great tool for the home. love it for shopping lists timers reminders and controlling my redone smart home.
3475,14,"there are 14,165 reviews posted as i type this up.  there is nothing i can say that will make a bigger impact than a rating that has been smoothed out by that many datapoints."
3476,10,"this was a gift and i am so happy with the echo! i use alexa all day long for weather, music, phone number look ups and trivia games."
3477,11,"this is everything that is good about echo 1 and dot except that the sound is stronger.  i really like that the covers can be changed.  if you can get only one, i recommend the echo 2.  it is the best of the three."
3478,14,"unfortunately alexa is just another garbage product.l, overhyped by the media. go ahead try it out for yourself and get screwed. you¡¯ll end up buying the apple homepod after 1 week of trying to use alexa anyway"
3479,14,"i bought this because my parents have one and it was fun to play with. i have now been integrating it in to some smart home features i have and have been very pleased. it has some quirks about how you have to say things and can be frustrating at times, but i have been happy with it and think it has been worth the money. i plan on adding a dot in the future as well."
3480,14,"met all my expectations, sound is great and the microphones are great. it was really easy to set for the first time with the alexa app. setting up smart plugs and fire devices to it was simple. would recommend to anyone looking to set up a smart home or that would like a hands free speaker. i feel that as time goes on you will see more integration with more apps and services."
3481,10,i love getting classical music in the morning and being able to get answers to questions. my grandaughter had to program it for me because my iphone is not very powerful so i still have not taken full advantage of all the possibilitiesit offers.
3482,11,"i think the sound, or at least the upper ranges were better on the original echo, but i love the more compact look and the new finishes"
3483,10,"the sound is great. my receiver died so i am using it to stream my favorite radio station. it also accompanies my workout with zippy songs i ask it to play.  love the responses to ""good morning"" and all the facts available.  i got one for my parents who find ""her"" amusing and fun, as well.  great price - great product."
3484,1,love the sound.
3485,14,"it is simple, i love love love all of the alexa is products.  the echo 2nd generation was initially purchased as a christmas gift that i ended up keeping because she sounded better. (do not judge me :) )"
3486,10,"great sound for such a small device.  mostly play music on it.  connects with most any app on my phone like youtube, pandora....alexa is awesome!  fun to play with....."
3487,14,unable to link phone to echo. i havr seen many reviews about this and all had different phones from multiple manufacturers. nothing has been done by amazon. i would give you a 5 star review but this is a big short coming. i would like this feature to work but the icon to link phone on your app does not show up. your echo mentioned nothing about which phones would work or would not. all phones should work. i feel kind of ripped off.
3488,10,love that we can listen to music and get all sorts of factoids!  also love that we can adjust the volume just by asking alexa!  quality of speaker is fantastic!
3489,14,"i am not sold on this device. has a lot of lacking features, now that i have it set up.  she is probably heading back to amazon.."
3490,0,i really thought the alexa echo had many more benefits than what it does.  there are alot of topics and questions  that she does not know.  seems like she only  know about orders i have purchased.
3491,11,alexa is the best! get it! i like the look and size of this one better than the original too. totally worth the money!
3492,14,my own assistant.. i do not have to rely on my phone as much and it gives me a break.  nice speakers and quality is outstanding!
3493,14,"this unit is horrible. i have a gen 1 which i use every day to play music at night to go to sleep to. it works 95% of the time. this new unit has failed multiple times using the exact same commands i gave to my gen 1. stay away from this unit, buy a gen 1!!!!"
3494,10,"this echo is great! i really like being able to control the lighting, getting the weather, information all sorts of things!"
3495,10,"love it. like a new toy, we used it constantly for the first 2 weeks. now, not as much but now learning different uses and questions. great addition to our house. little need to buy recorded music any more. play ""oldies"" we never had. listen to many different types of music and musicians now due to the ease of just asking. great item!!"
3496,9,echo works as advertised. i love it.sounds great and understands most of my request. i use it for music and would recommend  it to anyone.
3497,10,i bought this for my husband and could not be happier with my decision! he is having so much fun with it. he loves being able to get his weather and sports scores as well as traffic reports so easily. we are also having fun playing jeopardy every night!
3498,1,"love it, very useful device for my family."
3499,12,having so much fun with alexa!
3500,14,"the echo (2nd gen) is just an incredible device. there is not a day that goes by that i do not ¡°use¡± it in some way. music, alarm, directions, questions, shopping, etc. i¡¯m sure the echo will only get better so i¡¯m looking forward to updates."
3501,0,"still getting to know her, but so far i am very impressed!  can not get the weather right for where i live.  need to play around with it.  i do recommend this."
3502,14,we love having echo at our fingertips my daughter has one and my husband thought it was the best thing ever totally amazed. we use it all the time and i downloaded my itunes music on it also . works great!!!  altjough i was dissappointed 5 days after i purchased it the price went down 15 dollars bummer
3503,10,"i love my echo! i can ask for the weather, turn on and off lights, the news, trivia, a story, a song, music from my amazon music. i can also connect my ipad or iphone and play my own music. she is always getting smarter and i really enjoy it. can not wait to get a few more!"
3504,0,ok. she has trouble doing things on the first try. sound is ok but not great. i thought i would have 90 days to return.
3505,9,this is my first relationship with alexa so i have nothing to compare it with.  i use her primarily to play music. very nice sound.
3506,10,alexa is so fun to play with. she is great at setting timers and alarms. i¡¯m working on turning my home into a smart home and i can not wait to see all she can do.
3507,0,i love it!  i get to choose what i want to hear.  rarely does alexa not find the music i request.  i love getting the weather without turning on the tv.
3508,9,"this is better than expected, i use it many times during the day. bought one for the bedroom and two for an invalid family member."
3509,10,"i really enjoy the amazon echo and have used it daily since purchasing it.  i¡¯m enjoying using it to play music, get weather forecasts with the ease of just asking a question, find out useful information, and also to play a variety of fun games.  i would highly recommend this product."
3510,11,"i upgraded from the dot to this model so that i can listen to music.  really like the sound quality, and the price is good."
3511,11,"much better version than the 1st generation. the size is much more compact, and i like the different color options. it sounds great as well."
3512,10,i received this for a christmas gift and i did not think i would use it....well i was wrong. i love it! i need to learn all the things it can do so i am getting use to it but i just ordered paper products for my house...who knew
3513,11,"does not disappoint, good sound, nice bass, responsive microphones.  i have yet to buy an amazon creation that disappointed."
3514,0,alexa has been a great addition to our home. she is fun and engaging. her voice recognition is pretty good. the skills are very fun and keep my kids engaged.
3515,14,"one of my rare five-stars. the dot gets four, but the sound on this unit is just so much better, especially for music."
3516,14,"for something so small, the sound quality is very good.voice recognition works well and the alexa app connects effortlessly to other smart devices on your network.still trying to decide if this is really functional or just cool to have.i can do most of what it does on my phone which is normally close by."
3517,10,its a fun gadget. its easy to use. picks up an occasional conversation out of thin air on ! great product for the money.
3518,14,alexa is super fun and the sound for music is great!  i had a tough time syncing it to my iphone thru the alexa app.  the app needs better instructions for non technie people.
3519,9,this was a gift to my husband for his birthday.i do not know if he enjoys it but his family loves it.the grandchildren think all day of questions to ask.
3520,14,i tried for hours to get it connected but it never happened. i went to amazons help page but it did not help. i had prevesly connect my echo dot w/ no trouble
3521,14,echo turned on my christmas tree lights which was great. i do like the option to listen to music but have not been able to get my playlist onto alexia app. what i¡¯m very unhappy about is echo does not hear me all the time. it seems like it should be more responsive. i have not decided if i really like my echo - sad
3522,14,"there are plenty reviews out there concerning the problem with sound. i was ready to send the echo 2  back for a complete refund but in working with the technicians after three updates they finally got it right!  the original version was 592452420, the latest update is 592452720. this latest update has fixed the problem satisfactorily. music no longer sounds muffled.  kudos to the amazon team for standing behind their product."
3523,0,set up was not too difficult.  only downside is it has trouble understanding my wife ( i guess i do too).  may be southern accent.
3524,0,"probably needs a little work, understands about half of what i ask. i want to use it more for specific things not so much for asking alexa to tell me a joke or ask it stupid things like how is alexa doing? hopefully i will get more used to it but for now not overly excited."
3525,11,"great new version of amazon is alexa device!! speakers rock!!! great price, too!!! i picked the gray color and it blends in with my furniture. love it!!"
3526,14,"my second one, so i knew what to expect. good soundwould like to be able to pair to another echo in stereo mode."
3527,14,this device exceeded my expectations.  this is the wave of future.  it is a must have in every household.  very pleased i purchased echo.
3528,12,having fun with it. a lot of things to figure out. very handy controlling the fire tv..
3529,11,"the price was right, better sound then first generation, looks better on my shelf and a very nice fabric finish.thanks a bunch!"
3530,9,i bought this for my mother and i was not sure if she would use it much. but i was wrong she uses it all the time. super useful.
3531,10,"echo /alexa is fun and informative. i have a routine set every morning, and she wakes me up to weather and  traffic reports and such. she can tune in to radio stations, and has a ton of interactive apps. the only draw back is that i wish there were more apps that i use, and that she had more access to information. with a lot of questions i get ""i do not know that"" answers, and i find myself resorting to using google."
3532,11,"i was given this as a christmas gift.  unfortunately the sound quality is so poor i doubt that i will be using it.siri is sound quality is far better.  because of the poor sound quality, i cannot recommend this."
3533,14,sounds it good n crisp but for that price range i would of liked a more portable speaker. i like the design but what i didnt like is there is a rubber peice that blocks the aux port and i find it kinda hard plugging in a aux cord in becuase of it. that rubber peice is not nesscary to be there.
3534,14,alexia is not as smart as i had hoped.  basic problem is getting her to set the thermostat temperature.  some days she responds perfectly and the next time using the exact same instructions she responds totally confused and unable to find that device or make the adjustment.  the next time she will work perfectly again.  frustrating to find what instructions she actually will respond to every time.
3535,14,"the sound is good enough, unless your an audiophile.  of all the voice assistants alexa is better, it even understands most of what my 6 year old asks.  never used it for ""smart home"" stuff like lights."
3536,14,"i absolutely love this gadget. from the quirky jokes to the ¡°dah¡± it gave me when i lost a name that tube game, this is the best gadget ever!  i can not say enough good things about it.  if you love technology and gadgets this will blow your mind.  i think everyone should have this."
3537,0,"the microphone and range volume is great, but it randomly turns of after being given a command. this would also be much more useful if you could search the internet with a command. all in all, great item."
3538,10,this is a cool device to have and i enjoy to listen to alexa with my pandora and i find it helpful to find recipes to choose.
3539,10,"i have a love affair with alexa.  echo is downstairs, controlling my smart bulbs and door locks, and playing music and podcasts.  my dot is upstairs lulling me to sleep and waking me up in the morning.  so easy to install and control by either voice or the alexa app.  i am finally embracing technology"
3540,10,"this is the first echo i had so i really enjoy it.  it wakes you up, tells you jokes, plays music, and is a new friend.the charcoal fabric fits anywhere."
3541,10,"almost like having a companion in the room. check the time, the news and weather, request any music i would like to hear. even pretty good at answering information questions. always polite and sometimes even funny responses."
3542,0,do not like having to reset up every time i use it alexa do not respond as i expected have to tell to get it to respond
3543,0,"this was a gift given to me.  it was not thought out very well, as we do not have any smart devises in our home so the only thing i use it for is to say goodmorning, and to play me some music.  i do not even have a bluetooth for music, i just tell her to play a certain singers songs."
3544,14,"wonderful sound quality and alexa is ability to understand and respond appropriately to any voice is fantastic!helpful tasks include: weather, search, flash brief, play [name any artist] and it does it!i have several wireless bluetooth devices i would like to add on so i can hear music in multiple rooms.  this is a bit complicated and there seems to be limitations.  i am buying a hub to hopefully achieve this."
3545,14,it is unpredictable as to working even with a very strong internet signal. alexa has demencia. one minute you ask for the time and she is fine you can ask her 2 minutes later and she is 'not sure'. help/support says it is my weak signal. i am two floors above and directly across the street from the tower!
3546,14,"this was purchased to help control smart home features, it has been a pleasure to own.  everything connected as expected and it works from nearly every room on the same floor.  i can even call out from the bedroom to alexa and get a response to questions and smart devices. have not had any issues thus far."
3547,0,"amazon music. to have alexa set alarm, you need to specify for her to use souhd! not just rwirl around. it does not give you a audibal in order the noise in order to respond.  love the fact that one can name the artists, and she will respond. how about using jamie in completion of male vs. female? i love the name alexa. i just feel that a woman would prefer a males voice. just a thought! jamie o'gorman"
3548,14,"the sound is so much better than i expected. it fills the whole house. it picks up on things that i ask about easily, just have to be specific when asking for music since there are so many songs with duplicate titles. makes it extremely easy to put on some relaxing tunes while winding down at the end of the day, or something energizing to get through a day of cleaning house. plus the wood looks super classy. i am a big fan."
3549,14,although it is very good at providing voice control of amazon prime content. it still has a long way to go in providing general information from voice requests.
3550,9,alexa is the best gift i have ever got!!! she does anything i say. buy it and you will fall in love. i wish i had the dot for my bedroom.
3551,10,we love the echo and  alexa so much that  i purchased both of my siblings one for christmas. the echo plays my pandora and amazon music.  we use it for a timer in the kitchen when cooking and so much more. it was relatively easy to pair up and the music sound is very good
3552,10,"we love the echo. highest value tech based on usage - just the alarms and weather reports make life so much easier,"
3553,11,"very good sound quality, sometimes hearing is a little sensitive sometimes not especially with other sounds in the area like tv, but in general a big step up"
3554,9,"i got one of these and liked it so much i bought one for my son-in-law and he loves it, too.  pretty good sound for music."
3555,9,i have owned less than a month and speaker rattles.  my echo dog with separate bluetoot h speaker is a much better option
3556,0,it is great! the only problem is that alexia will start talking without mentioning her name or asking her a question.  this has happened 2 times so far.
3557,9,"gift for my husband, who has amd and very little sight, given to him from our son & his wife.  a perfect gift for him to be able to use the voice interaction for so many things.  he thoroughly enjoys it.."
3558,11,alexa is amazing! i cannot believe the sound quality that comes out of this little cylinder. very pleased with the design and function.
3559,11,"so far i love it. better sounding quality than the first gen, which is nice because it is smaller. i wish it had the volume control as a dial rather than buttons but i still love it."
3560,10,our family has had such fun with alexa and using her to stream music. its sounds good and im glad to have it in our home.
3561,11,"love my echo, and small enough to set in any location...echo replaced 2 speakers and stereo system. i¡¯m very happy."
3562,0,"i love this thing. i need a tutorial, but i still love it. i found i needed the dot to go with and it is better that way."
3563,11,"i live the echo, i first bought a dot and its nice but the sound quality of the echo is so much more richer and so much nicer"
3564,14,"i am unable to connect the alexa app -- the username and password is correct. tried with ipad, iphone and alexa web app. after 30 minutes with an unhelpful agent -- still no connection.  it is on its way back to amazon."
3565,14,"the day they make a coordless echo, we might try it again. i was really disappointed that something high-tech did not have a charger. the speaker is ok. we prefer to use our bose for music (naturally). it also randomly turns on. the alexa is better than siri though."
3566,14,"bought this to use at work so i could play music in the background and ask echo questions. you can not control the volume separately control the volumes so to hear alexa the music is blasting. to listen to the music at a reasonable volume, you can not hear alexa. searched the forums and have not found a solution but to constantly change the volume before every command. no as smart as i thought it would be."
3567,14,"i enjoy the echo very much. the sound quality is superb. i love that i have a seemingly endless musical catalog that is easily available by voice command. i went ahead and subscribed to amazon music, and have been listening to my favorites. i would have given it five stars if it were not for alexa is limited knowledge on science topics. however, i still recommend the echo. no regrets."
3568,14,excellent echo device but the windows alexa web app for my laptop is lacking in setting up the echo for voice training and drop-in/calling functions.
3569,14,i use it mainly for pandora and i love it! i ordered a 2nd and i am still trying to figure out how to sync them up to play music simultaneously.
3570,9,we love it! it is used everyday and fits into our lifestyle as we never imagined.  we bought 3 dots to go with it throughout the house!
3571,9,i love the new echo. sounds great. super simple to set up and use. i can not wait till i get a couple of the smart light bulbs to go with it. i am very pleased with my purchase.
3572,11,the smaller package is great ... the sound is as good or maybe a little better than the previous version.  the spin volume control was better but the buttons work fine...  great step forward.
3573,0,works okay.  often dosent have answers to questions and at times has a hard time understanding.  great for music and phone calls.
3574,14,hell yeah! excellent christmas gift from our sons! driving my wife crazy with the music i play. still learning the functionality but cool 21st century gizmo!
3575,1,sounds great!!!
3576,10,love it!  if you have prime all you need to do is ask it to play whichever artist is music and voila!  clean the house while rocking out.
3577,10,"very responsive to my requests. i use it for news and weather info, podcasts and audio books, and shopping lists that sync to my phone."
3578,14,"love echo!! great everywhere i go. i took it to spain, different states...it is easy to operate and works perfectly!"
3579,0,on my old echo it would play a continuous  shuffle of songs by a given artist.  on the new on many artists  will only play one song
3580,12,"was a christmas gift, still figuring our how to use, but so far a lot of fun--have played my music & really enjoyed it"
3581,14,i love the amazon echo. besides the obvious weather and music it is capable of  doing so much more. since we have had it only a short amount of time we are still looking at the various skills it can do. we do go to bed every night listening to music and telling everyone to turn it off after fifteen minutes. what did we do without this? will let you all know after we learn some more skills if we still feel the same way
3582,14,"i love this device, i have gotten totally  spoiled!  also, the speakers on this echo are superb, loud, crisp, and lots of bass!"
3583,14,this is incrediblei love my echo. i love the music feature and i can use voice control to skip songs repeat or go back
3584,11,"i have now got 5 of these in my house (1 1st gen, 4 2nd gen), and they work fantastically together.  the voice recognition in the 2nd gen is significantly better than the 1st, but overall they are all awesome."
3585,0,"having fun with alexa so far, but it is not always easy to figure out exactly how to phrase commands.  adding skills is fairly simple"
3586,14,"great product.  this was supposed to be a return, but looks new to me.  works asexpected with no problems and easy set up."
3587,10,easy peezy setup! i love my alexa! looking forward to playing with her and learning more of what she can do!! i even thank her all the time! wish she could say you¡¯re welcome! haha!!
3588,8,love it use it every day
3589,14,"this device needs an option to adjust wifi output strength. currently, it puts out way too much power and is a health and security hazard as a result."
3590,9,"my mom bought it for me. it is something i never would have bought for myself. i totally totally dig it particularly for the music, but she is also very amusing. i have been teaching her french in the morning. and i love the fart jokes were high. it is also pretty hilarious in the morning i yell out to her from three rooms away to play a tune or to play a new stream. and my dog freaks out. she is cool welcome addition to our family"
3591,14,family is enjoying alexa & all the games & info. only problem is they do not tell you that to use some of the features you need amazon prime or amazon music unlimited & both have a monthly fee!! was not able to listen to my music until i signed back up for prime. now i can listen to alot more music but i still get a prompt to add music unlimited for certain songs.
3592,10,i replaced my bulky radio/cd player and speakers and now have access to my entire bedside table! it looks super sharp and it sounds amazing.
3593,14,work great as of now for what i¡¯m doing with it
3594,14,"very fun to play with. makes me feel fancy turning off and on the lights with a voice command. great with amazon music. it can actually make phone calls without the use of your cell phone. send voice messages to your friends who have one also. alexa is dumb as rocks and often mis-understands your commands, often to a comedic level."
3595,0,"she is fun! it is funny to hear my husband thank you for her help, but the music stations dont stay well, they fad in and out alot"
3596,14,"this was actually an item i won from work (i work at an amazon fc) and i must say, it is great sound quality for it is size. great for situations where i want to listen to music but my hands are tied."
3597,3,do not know how i ever lived without alexa.
3598,10,use it everyday.  just the convenience of being able to do certain things play certain music is just phenomenal i also bought the hughes philips light works great with that system to turn off and on lights when i need to without touching switch
3599,11,it is much slower in responding to commands than my first generation echo. i do not hear any difference in the sound quality. i regret spending the extra money to upgrade.
3600,11,"great device. picked it up for $79, and could not be happier with its performance and sound quality."
3601,12,sounds pretty good was actually kinda surprised !
3602,0,"this is a great, terrific product. you can name a song and it comes on... or an artist or a type of music. wonderful."
3603,0,it did not understand us most of the time and when i repeated it three time it would turn the light red and do nothing
3604,10,this new alexa looks great and sounds great. i linked it to my pandora account for free and use it to listen to music on demand. good sound quality for a little device.
3605,14,the least: limited knowledge of global social economic and political situation. minimum knowledge of ethnic cultural traditions . it is a marketing tool that has been inserted in my home through false advertisement of it is use inabilities. the only thing it does right is it has a working alarm. through false advertising it is inserted in homes in order to coerce the residents to spend money and buy applications. it is a scam!
3606,10,"controls my lights. but i do ask her a lot of questions and she is not sure. and google comes to the rescue.  worth it still. plays music for my puppy when i leave and i set a timer on alexa so it does not play all night,"
3607,14,loving this so far. as an amazon prime member...i do feel like we should have the unlimited music when we purchase an echo. but it is what it is.
3608,10,this is such a great product. being disabled allows me  to access information and perform tasks but otherwise i would need to ask help for.
3609,14,"speaker sounds good, does not require me to speak loud to hear my commands. super easy to set up. looking forward to seeing what else it can do"
3610,10,"we love this!! it plays songs, answers questions, etc. still experimenting with other capabilities, but so far so good!"
3611,9,"we have the echo dot and got this one after... and the sound quality of this far out weighs the dot, though we still love and will use both."
3612,10,its my morning routine to check in the my echo.  i am sure it will do much more than i request but to let me know the information i want to hear at 7 am is nice and i can listen while i get ready.
3613,9,"we have had fun learned many subjects , timer . just a joy to have l it was a christmas gift and i appreciat it so much ."
3614,0,"wish alexa was ai but i can live with the convenience of being able to yell out music selections, order from amazon prime, etc.  amazing product."
3615,10,"i really like my echo. i use it mostly to play music, use timers and alarms.  it is also nice to have someone write your shopping list."
3616,14,upgraded from an echo dot. sound is great and the styling of the unit is nice as well. can fill our living room with music with out a problem. also linked to our fire tv making a remote less necessary.
3617,14,"this is the smaller one but plenty loud enough, no need to spend more on the larger speaker version, you really have to buy the music package for 3.99 a month to really get any music on this thing, so i did, it is great, use it daily,"
3618,14,after just a day with the echo 2. it is already become routine for our family. we have ours in the kitchen. when you enter the room and tell alexa to play some music by artist or by genre it is impressive.. it has a reasonably good audio system. the interaction with alexa lot of value. it is very useful when you need information. after initial s few hours of using echo 2 you will find. as i did that you are already coming to rely on her.
3619,14,what can be said that all of the other reviews have not covered? it looks good. it sounds good. my family and i like it!
3620,10,"i¡¯ve has my echo for about a month now and i¡¯ve really been enjoying it! my husband and i used it in a lot of different ways such as dropping in on relatives, lots of skills in my flash briefing, and playing all kinds of games and listening to music. everything has been working very well and at the price this has been a wonderful deal and worth every cent. we got the buttons too and those are cool."
3621,14,"the sound quality is amazing!!  do not need a stereo to listen to music, and now have it hooked up to my tv for sound!  awesome!"
3622,11,love this echo! awesome speaker. plays my tunes wonderfully. very nice design as well. blends right in to wherever it is put.
3623,9,"bought it for a friend and hey love it. never thought of buying it for themselves, now wish they had it sooner."
3624,10,awesome
3625,14,the echo is awesome. sounds way better than my standalone bluetooth speaker. having this linked to my pandora and amazon music accounts has made it easy to listen to music for hours and never worry about hearing the same song twice.
3626,14,"i like using it for music the most.  however, when it comes to operas, concertos, and symphonies it only plays parts of them, rather than the whole thing."
3627,11,"the sound is better than the echo and it can be paired with my echo and my dot. however, why cannot it be paired with the tap??"
3628,14,"since i have internet through only an xifinity hotspot, she disconnects every time i leave my house. plus, she cannot excess my itunes music. so i usually just use the speaker with bluetooth but at that point i just have a non portable speaker. i am also not sure if mine is just defective, but the sound is super distorted. i will be replacing to see if that helps. would not buy again, it was a gift so cannot return."
3629,14,love the sound. love the look not to gouty. only thing not really happy with did not upgrade properly. i had to redo delete and redo the skills on that one did not take over lead spot that well.
3630,14,i like this speaker but i own an iphone and it is not compatible with my apple music that is my main source of music. i also have to like scream at it like very loudly for alexa to understand what i¡¯m saying half the time <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0082>.it is still really cool and i like that you can change the skins and there is an app that goes with it.
3631,14,amazing sound quality.  the echo has replaced our satellite music channels as the primary source of our casual listening.  the amazon prime music library is unbelievable.  alexa can retrieve virtually any songs or performers that we ask for.
3632,0,its ok it doesnt seem to answer alot of questions we throw at it. i wamt to return it and get the echo with the screen. for what it is it is not bad great sound.
3633,0,"sure, alexa does not always understand me or listen to exactly what i say, but hey... neither does my kid, yet i love her anyway. alexa is pretty great so i ended up ordering a second one. probably not aiming for a second kid any time soon though. haha!"
3634,3,i was not sure i would use this... but i wanted it.. and i use it more than i thought i would.  i really like it.
3635,10,"it does everything i thought it would do. it makes it much easier to add items, and play different types of music. i¡¯m trying to add my calendar,but i¡¯m having problems. i¡¯ll call support!"
3636,10,love it.  lots of fun!  recommend buying it. like asking for jokes!  also speaker is great.  love playing music through it.
3637,0,i love it but i¡¯m not using it to its full potential my daughter has one that does everything but her fiance is an engineer
3638,0,thought it could be more useful but finding that you have to have a lot of apps on your device to use all the echo features.
3639,10,"i love it. alexa says good night to me, sleep,tight.i really love the sound with a music request. very good buy."
3640,14,"i received the 1st as a gift and the other 5, well.... i did have to make sure the house was covered.  from lights, to plugs, to switches, oh my!  i can even order my favorite pizza!  it is useful and fun.  thanks amazon!"
3641,14,"we do not get as much use out of alexa as we thought we would.  hoping that it will improve as we add more compatible devices.  we have had problems with it connecting to other amazon alexa devices in the house.  we also have the fire tv, show, and the plus.  overall, it just seems to be much more limited in functionality at this point in time than what we expected.  you can see the potential though."
3642,0,"it does not speak farsi which is really annoying!it is unfair to a great population of people who live here! there is more than a million iranian/american in usa ! another problem is that echo is not connected to google therefore it cannot answer all questions!i have to pay for spotify each month which i do not like!other than those things, it is a nice thing to have!"
3643,11,much improved sound quality and speaker reception over the echo dot this replaced. and i like the looks of the heather gray.
3644,10,"i absolutely love my echo! it works great, i can turn the volume up & listen to my music. has a decent speaker!"
3645,14,"good entertainment for grandkids and love playing music, but disappointed at how many of thing skills i was counting on require more technical ability than i have - particularly syncing with my iphone calendar, which was one of my two main reasons for purchasing."
3646,0,"i am paralyzed and alexa is becoming a thing i do not know how i got along without her before she turns lights on and off, tells me when stuff is arriving, it is just a cool interactive thing to have i am impressed"
3647,14,"love this echo, it has deep bass so when i play music. it also serves as my alarm & provides me with weather/news when i ask it to. i was a bit skeptical about buying one but now i have this one in my room & an echo dot in each other room & one in the living room."
3648,0,"the echo is awesome but for the life of me i do not understand how amazon has not already created a spanish-language enabled echo.  es una locura que alexa no entiende el espanol!  i want to speak english and spanish with alexa!!  670 million people in latin america, and around 30 million seek spanish in the usa.  get with it amazon!  :-)"
3649,10,love this!!!!! and so easy to set up.  we are having a blast listening to old music from high school and turning on and off lights.  very helpful when you have a quick question especially when you are cooking and need a conversion done.
3650,14,great...does everything they say and the sound quality is fantastic.  get one quick before they change it.  and charge more
3651,14,i have been very happy with the echo. the sound is good enough for me although i have never been a big sound system guy. alexa almost never hears me wrong. i am not entirely sure it is a good thing that i can just start talking about pizza and alexa will send me one...maybe she should throw in a few passive aggressive comments about my weight now and again.
3652,11,"sound seems lounder and bass clear and reinforced from the previous ones. i have 3 ""alexas"" and love them."
3653,9,"this is a step up from the dot, we have a large livings room and i can speak 2 alexa from my kitchen area which is close to the living room it is fun to play with her as my teenage nieces and nephews did i think the family is hooked on her"
3654,14,this little gem gets better and better everyday! i can not believe the quality of sound that comes out of it! must have! it absolutely rocks and i am an apple guy
3655,0,easy to set up. good sound.have not figured out how to play music whole home. instructions not easy to follow.
3656,14,"alexa is the best! works well with my bose sound bar, lights, my amazon prime products, etc and it learns daily!!!"
3657,10,it was a gift. i love it- it stays in the kitchen for me listen to music while cooking and the kids like to ask her questions.
3658,1,"love it!! alexa is very responsive and the sound is superb, especially with music from pandora and iheart radio. the sound is full, well balanced and enough sound to fill my large famiy room."
3659,0,sound is excellent but i¡¯m disappointed that i have to connect via bluetooth every time i want to play music from my phone. also bummed you have to have certain premium music subscriptions in order for it to play certain songs.
3660,11,bought with an echo dot as a combo deal.positives: i found that echo 2nd gen is alot louder than the dot.negatives: sound quality is just ok. though not that big of a deal to me personally.
3661,14,"for buying it when it was on sale, coupled with having unlimited music through amazon as well i¡¯m more than happy. i love it!!"
3662,11,see no improvement over 1st gen except for the price. the sound is not as clear. definitely not worth the purchase if your intent is to upgrade a gen1.
3663,14,"pleasantly surprised with voice recognition technology as well as the excellent sound.  i believe this technology will be in almost every home within the next few years.  for future development, the sky is the limit.  i can see an incredible amount of development that will be added to this amazing product."
3664,0,i thought i would use it more. i hardly use it at all . in some cases it is more of a nuisance. because it can be temperamental. meaning sometimes it does not always respond. may need to have it longer and use more.
3665,10,"love my echo! this is really an amazing product. love my ""flash briefings"" every morning! :)  why did i wait so long to get this???"
3666,11,"this product is great. why buy a bluetooth speaker when this is cheaper, sounds just as good, and can do way more"
3667,14,"i have either a echo, or a dot in every room in the house. alexa completely controls my smart house. life is good if everything is working."
3668,12,"looks good, sounds good, works. alexa seems to be the ubiquitous platform for home automation so i caved and i am happy so far."
3669,14,"i like the music the most, so easy and sounds great but if you want even better music you can blue tooth it to speakers of your choice. it was a little tough setting everything up but very doable."
3670,0,"this is a fun piece of equipment.  however, alexa gets confused when i i want her to play music from pandora.  sometimes it works and other times not so much.  it is fun to ask questions and get answers right away."
3671,10,i love the access to amazon music library. i enjoy saying good morning alexa and having her tell me important dates in history.
3672,11,"excellent product. i purchased the echo, so my echo dot could be relocated to master bedroom. i¡¯m beyond pleased. exceptional sound, voice recognition, quality and so much more. definitely worth the upgrade. love it!!"
3673,9,works perfectly.  i purchased this primarily as a way to add music to my work out room.  it has a great speaker.
3674,10,we love both the echo and the dot that we received for christmas.  listening to a wide variety of music at any time is amazing.  our 3 year old granddaughter asked alexa to play dinner music last week.  hands free asking of almost any question is addictive.
3675,10,"great sound, actually amazing sound....still trying to figure out what music company i want to go with, (though you do not need one for just basic music). great for reminders and daily weather!"
3676,14,"i honestly did not know what to expect, but i was shocked. it is an amazing product. i am able to do everything from my phone using the app such as reminders, grocery lists, shopping online with amazon, controlling my samsung smart tv and my fire stick! i also have the echo dot and it is just a good. both products are very useful and easy to use."
3677,9,"i love alexa! the sound quality is incredible, and fills my entire 1,400 square foot, 3 bedroom condo. very good product."
3678,0,"i love it, but have a harder time with her ""listening"" when music is playing. you  have to shout at it and ask it to stop."
3679,10,love it! use it mostly for music and shopping. occasionally for a question.have not had it very long so will keep playing with it.
3680,10,"after the initial games are over.i am still trying to find how to really use echo to help me grow personally and professionally.i am open to suggestions, videos, webinars..."
3681,14,"sound is pretty good...functionality nicely paired up with spotify.but in experimenting with commands it still does not understand a lot of things... i guess the next gen will improve on that. i wish i could play music on it and on the paired up bluetooth speaker at the same time instead of one or the other... if anyone from amazon is listening, work on that next!"
3682,14,"awesome!  i got this for the better half and she loves it.  whether you are listening to music or a podcast, it sounds great!"
3683,14,"i bought because the sound quality was supposed to be pretty good, how ever i was disappointed in the sound. i decided to return it because of that.amazon is great to work with on returns."
3684,10,"i think it is absolutely wonderful and a timesaver, o am forever making notes and shopping lists  when i remember i need something which means stopping getting my phone or something to write it down on now i just talk to alexa she answers my questions absolutely love this.what i do not like about this it is people like me who are seriously technically challenged get frustrated trying to set stuff up but otherwise love love love"
3685,10,"this really neat device, still learning all the functions which change daily.  great for reminders and lists"
3686,10,it was easy to setup and i have had fun with it. i also have used it to tell me the weather and other helpful information.  i just setup iheartradio on it and am enjoying music on it now.
3687,14,so far it meets all my expectations. i am very happy with both of the units i ordered. no complaints at all. wish i had more time to discover more of the cool features i am probably missing out on still. i like being able to have all units playing music throughout the house. it might be cool if i were able to decide my own wake word but i understand why that isnt available yet. overall i am very happy with my echos.
3688,14,"this is not very smart ai.  i have asked it a lot of questions and the only two it could answer were simple math questions and a very generalized prediction of the weather.  it does not seem to learn or give consistent answers either.  in case i did not enunciate well enough or word my questions in a way that ai could not determine what i wanted, i asked the same questions to my google phone app, and it has answered every one correctly.  for example, what i thought would be an easy one for an amazon related ai was ""what is the title of some of the books written by adelle davis?""  the first time i asked, alexa answered with something totally unrelated.  the second time, a few days later, she said she could not answer that one.  the third time she said ""if you want to see the books on your kindle touch the book tab and then touch show all books"".  google listed three of her most sold books and indicated she had written others as well.  i asked alexa ""which president of the united states was a geologist"" and she did not know, but the google app on my phone not only answered correctly, it gave me links describing his geology career, when he worked in gold mines in australia, china, etc.  i have asked alexa if a local store was open on sunday and she gave me today is (saturday is) hours.  my phone app will tell me hour by hour when rain is likely to start, so it might indicate low probability until 11am so i know i can go for an early morning walk with out worry.  alexa will just say something like ""there is a 50% chance of rain today"".  i am guessing this is mainly designed to place orders on amazon and useful for little else, but there is no way i would trust it to do that.  i would be afraid i would ask for rolls of toilet paper and end up with a rolls royce delivered instead.  i sure hope it learns and gets better with time."
3689,14,i like this alot better then the dots .. the sound and mic work from farther away ... big room get one of these.
3690,14,very good sound. i like the fact that it lets you know when a package arrives.the ability to do almost anything via voice command is great. do not like the fact that it responds to everyone. i thought once i setup my voice it would only respond to me. every time a commercial comes on it goes crazy.
3691,11,"the sound is much richer than the 1st generation, and this makes a difference when i play music via the multi room setting.  love it!"
3692,10,"i like asking her questions about trivia, spelling and getting songs played. it is a lot of fun.. i would recommend it."
3693,14,"tried to activate tuesday nite she told me 50s rock was on, tried two more times told me the same thing. the next day worked fine and worked last nite."
3694,0,fast hook up an easy to use.  i only wish that it could say yes or no to questions about what has been added to lists rather than repeating the entire list.
3695,1,very convenient.  i mostly use it as a source of music.  linked to pandora and siriusxm.  pretty good sound fo a small box.
3696,0,i like almost everything about the new echo except alexa is still a little to picky about how you have to phrase your commands.
3697,10,"i love this new look. it works perfectly. the sound is fantastic and i love listening to music and audio books on it. and alexa is so helpful. i just say ""connect iphone"" and she connects my iphone and bam i am listening to music. so many things i can do with alexa. definitely recommended!"
3698,0,"it is fantastically handy and fun, but i do not think the software is getting the attention it needs. alexa acts up, talks out of turn, and sometimes just does what she wants."
3699,9,i bought one initially after debating about it for months.  i was immediately impressed by the quality of the sound.  two weeks later i bought two more.  i love having music playing in multiple rooms.  great product.  plan to get two more so that music can play throughout the house.
3700,0,"if you talk quiet it does not always pick up on what you say. also, if you have a lot of noise it can not be hard to tell it what to do"
3701,14,"i¡¯ve had my echo for a few months now, and i am still in love! i never have to wonder about the latest news or the weather. if there is a song stuck in my head, alexa will play it for me. the sound quality is better than expected."
3702,10,love it! bought one for my salon to put up on a shelf out of the way. use it mostly for streaming music & can quickly change the music based on clients. also great timer & fact checking when discussing news headlines.decided i needed one at home after using in my salon.
3703,0,"you have to have paid accounts to use it, we actually have not even got to use it properly because of that.it needs to be more clear about what accounts you actually have to have in order to use it."
3704,10,received for christmas from my son...had no idea what it was! absolutely love love love it!  i listen to all kinds of music and am discovering new things to ask alexa every day!!!
3705,10,we love our new echo (2nd generation)!we love the sound of the music we request.alexa will answer any question. we use her for our grocery list & any thing else we want put on our phones thus saving time of writing it down & getting to the store & forgetting the list!she has access with our phone numbers & will call anyone we ask her to call without having to use our phone.
3706,0,i like most about this is the music and sound quality out of it. i ask alexa to set the timer and at night she shuts off the music. i have been married twice and this is the fist woman that listens to what i have to say.
3707,10,works great. i have listened to more music since i got it as it is so very easy. makes it a snap to explore new music
3708,14,love it.  will not fill a room with music but great for voice.  i am an audiophile so i have a dot connected to my receiver for big sound.
3709,0,"i am happy having this.  surprised the thing i ask it, does not know the answers.  i do not have anything to compair it to."
3710,9,this was given to me as a gift and i love it! i¡¯m amazed at what it can do and cannot imagine what i would do without it
3711,10,"we love this thing. we can walk in the door at night and instead of fumbling through the dark for a light switch we tell alexa to turn on the light. we have played games, and music. the sound that comes through speaker is great. we have only touched the surface of everything it can do but we are having fun with it."
3712,10,"we love playing our favorite music, obtaining our calendar schedules, and getting all sorts of information just by asking."
3713,11,the new echo is a big improvement as far as sound quality and its hearing capability. but to many times the sound cuts out and skips. the old echo never did that.maybe the next firmware update will make it better.
3714,9,"it is a fun tech toy and does so many different things, and helpful in so many ways. speaker has a great sound being so small."
3715,10,"we love our echo! i bought this to help my wife after surgery; she can tell alexa to turn on the light, play music, read etc."
3716,9,"i am so in love with my echo, the sound is excellent. i also am impressed with how funny alexa can be.  i would recommend this to anyone who likes hight tech items."
3717,11,love my 2nd generation echo.super easy to set up.the speaker is really loud too which you could hear all over the house.
3718,14,the sound quality could be better but overall i¡¯m impressed with separation. alexa keeps getting smarter every day.
3719,14,sound is most excellent for a device so small. some issues in setting up probably due to wifi issues. introduced me to amazon smooth jazz. bought smaller echo dot for brother. totally pleased with ppp: purchase-price-performance!
3720,14,"hi, i¡¯m glad that i upgraded my echo to the 2nd generation. not only did it come in a smaller form, but the sound was much better too! <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+008a>"
3721,10,loving this echo and alexa. i got it mostly for music but i am now starting to get used to doing other things with alexa. and the sound is beautiful that comes out of it.
3722,14,"this newer model echo does not allow drop in mode even with drop in mode enabled. compared my 1st to 2nd generation and 1st gen works and sounds better!!!! the longer i have it the more flaws become evident, this 2nd generation is not an improvement!sound is worse, features do not work that do work on first generation!fabric immediately collects dust making it difficult to keep clean.older echo and echo dots work just fine. spoke to customer service and they wrote up a ticket but a resolution if any could take days.stick the old models!they said they would escalate the issue to their escalation team. since a member of their team did not respond, follow up, or reply they ¡°automatically¡± closed the ticket with out resolving the problem.now there is a new problem, the drop in from alexa app does not work. they have admittedly been flooded with complaints and still have no solution!they have failed to resolve the issues and have failed to correct it after hours on the phone trouble shooting."
3723,10,"the quality of the speaker amazed me...i play music on it mostly, very very impressed.sometimes alexa is a smart@$$."
3724,14,constantly quits playing....rebooting several times a day...this product has way too many bugs to recommend
3725,2,love it
3726,10,"what a great sound coming from this, the music is unbelievable!  just getting a feeling for how much alexa is able to do!"
3727,4,nice
3728,14,amazon continues to make great products at reasonable prices.  the sound quality is good.  alexa get is better and better.  i am an apple user and could not care less about their upcoming speaker.
3729,3,"it was a gift, did not know what to expect. i will sayit has very good sound. we enjoy the jokes.  niceto have around."
3730,10,"i have the echo in my craft room. it is been great to listen to music, set the timer so i do not stay all day, etc."
3731,0,"i mostly use it for its simple job as a bluetooth speaker, but sometimes i like to have fun with alexa and all her features. it is a great product!"
3732,11,i have 7 different echo products i have the 1st and 2nd generation echo. like the sound quality of the first generatiounbetter. the 2nd gen. is much cheaper. well worth the money .love my echos
3733,0,"i got this as a gift. i really like it. takes some getting used to. because every time you say alexa, she wakes up!  i have not had it very long so there is a lot to learn. but so far so good!"
3734,14,"this looks nice and is easy to use -- however, you can not get a white or ivory cord for it so the black adapter and cord kind of spoil the clean look of the white fabric."
3735,10,"i love it!!! answers a lot of questions like what will the weather be today but so much more and alexa is getting smarter as time goes by. also plays music which sounds incredible, makes lists, calls to your contacts the list goes on and on."
3736,3,i bought this not expecting for this to be so useful.  the children love it and it is very fun. it' s quickly becoming an item item i did not know i could not live without
3737,9,added this one for my office.  have a dot in the kitchen and we like it so much that i picked up one for my home office.
3738,12,"works well, speaker is pretty good, i have developed a few skills for it and home automation using aws. that was a bit tricky but finally figured it out in a few days. i code in c++ and vb but had to learn json from scratch. i am using the adafruit feather huzzah with headers pid  3213 which also works good."
3739,0,you have to program everything to your liking and what you want it to know.  i would think if it is hook up to the internet it would have a way to figure the question your looking for with google.
3740,10,"bought as a gift for my honey. very informative, great for quick answers. thinking of getting for grandchildren."
3741,14,the echo is a good additional to the first edition echo that we had already. we can play music throughout the house now.
3742,14,purchased it to use with my siriusxm radio. siriusxm plays well on my phone and computer and says it is linked but alexa does not seem to understand. it only works well on things that amazon can charge you for.
3743,9,"at first i was leary about getting alexa but once i decided to get alexa i was amazed at all the things that she can do i listen to a flash briefing every morning as well as the verse of the day. i know what is going on in the world before i step out into it everyday, my daughter and i we talk back and forth from alexa to alexa second generations every morning before work. i simply love alexa and wished i had gotten her sooner."
3744,14,has potential but directions must have been written by a teenager.  directions assume too much knowledge on part of reader; geared for younger people in mind.
3745,11,"placed this one in the kitchen, can talked to wife if in the living room though the echo is now. music sounds surprisingly great through this one. has a good bass sound."
3746,10,i liked the quick response to question and have the system play my favorite radio station. i also liked the weather update anytime i would ask.
3747,9,"i got this as a gift and love it!! i want another for other rooms and connectors to get the maximum use out of it. my dad did not know much about it but now that he sees it in action he is decided on one too. this is an amazing gift, easy set up, and exceptional sound quality."
3748,14,ordered as a second one (loved the first one).  speaker quality poor on this one and frequently looses the wi-fi connection.  the first one i purchased has an excellent speaker and never looses the wi-fi connection even thou it is much farther away.
3749,0,we are learning to use this. have one is sure with it. i can ask it to play music and it does' but sometimes after a few minutes it just shuts off. why? i did not ask it to and once i left the music playing and went outside and when i came back in it had shut off. why?
3750,10,this thing will change your life!!  kids love listening to their favorite songs.  great kitchen addition.
3751,10,"she is a nice addition to our house. we chat with her daily. indispensable no, but a welcome source of information and amusement."
3752,10,got this before the holidays at a discount and it us fantastic.  the whole family enjoys asking questions and requesting music.
3753,10,"i absolutely love it.  the sound and tone is excellent.  so much fun picking out favorite songs and artists and being able to categorize it all where i can quickly find what i want to hear over and over again.  this compact little gem takes up almost no space at all.  can now clean house of old records, cd is etc.  have not found anything about it that i do not like at this point and can not imagine that i will."
3754,11,"better sounding on calls than the original according to family. i do not know if it is notably louder, but it does reproduce voices better."
3755,11,"very pleased with the sound volume and quality from the built in speaker, would cost much more to buy quality bluetooth speaker to attach to echo dot. if you need a speaker for a big room, spend the extra money and get the echo, well worth it."
3756,10,"love it. i had to change its name from alexa to echo. it drove us crazy everytine we would talk to our granddaughter, alexa. love the amazon music collection too."
3757,0,its been fun having this echo in our home. most of the time i like it a lot but sometimes i become frustrated at the echo when it will not do what i ask of it.  i rate it a 4 for now.  i like the jokes it tells us.
3758,9,i was not sure i would like it but now i am thinking of getting another one for a different room.  love the music.
3759,12,the amount of tasks and skills it can do is amazing it does so much so many different options it is a little overwhelming to learn how the bad thing is that you have to buy more stuff and attachments in order to use all the options we buy things to be smart so we do not have to
3760,14,great way to have easy access to my favorite music in any room.  moves easily from 1 room to the next and surprisingly has powerful sound.
3761,14,"great sound.  very responsive with accurate information.  if amazon continues to improve its capabilities, this will be a very useful part of the home."
3762,10,"the echo is amazing! it is full of information, you can ask it to remind you to do things at a certain time, like call the doctor at 2 p.m., you can set timers and the music it plays is limitless."
3763,14,i have three (3) and love them. especially with all of the skills that continue to be created. the music sounds great and i have the 3 of them playing the same music at the same time and it fills my house.
3764,14,very easy to open ap. on ipad.  not successful on windows 10 for some reason.great sound and very useful!
3765,0,"i am sure that if you have a number of devices connected, this item might be  useful, but we do not. there is only a mild entertainment value to asking alexa questions and getting her sometimes informative and sometimes humorous responses."
3766,14,i see reviews that say sound is not up to par.  to me it is great.  i guess some expect a symphony out of a soup can.
3767,9,i bought the echo for my son and his wife. they love it. their children use it to play trivia games and they use it for many other things. the sound is great and it was easy to set up for them all to use.
3768,14,"the echo is a really great device.  it has great sound quality and the size is prefect.  the only flaw is that it is so amazon possessive. i like spotify. i do not want to ""connect"" to my device every freaking time to hear my playlists.  amazon,  be grateful for all the money you have made through all of us consumers and get with the fact that not every music choice should be through you.  it is annoying."
3769,3,great buy good product.
3770,10,"the best gift i received!!!!!!!!!!!! excellent sound quality. i can instruct the echo to call my mom, weather forecast and more."
3771,12,first foray into this type of device but it really is a great product.  easy to use and it does make life more convenient.
3772,0,"the sound is great,but i am having issues because she constantly is telling me she does not have the answer to that question or she can not ever  find music by whom ever. we have one at the office and it has much more information to give and can find just about everything asked of it. not as excited as i thought i would be because i get more from asking google. why can she answer the same question at the office but not at home?"
3773,14,i have owned an echo dot for over a year and it was just fine for asking questions and listening to music in the background. i recently purchased an amazon echo and am blown away.  it fills the whole room with rich sound. for the price it is a no brainer.
3774,14,"the sounds is amazing for such a small package. i would have given it five stars, but the new version does not support voice controlled volume. that it a bit of a pain. keeps saying "" function not supported""."
3775,10,i really am enjoying the echo. it is responsive. setting up other smart home gear has been simple. great product.
3776,14,my main problem is that alexa cannot answer anywhere near as many questions as the google home can. the sound is great.
3777,11,i love the new echo.  put it in the bedroom and it works beautifully with my original in the living room.
3778,14,i mostly use it for playing music and love it.  i had a bit of trouble setting it up but customer service was great.
3779,14,"echo is awesome. i never owned the first one, but i can assume that this one is better. everything about it is incredible."
3780,14,there are a couple of things i liked about the 2nd generation but the sound it generated did not meet expectations.  there was more of a bass presence in the first generation which is why we chose to return the 2nd and purchase the 1st.
3781,10,great device.  sound quality is good but could be better.  i appreciate the tips of the things that alexa can do.
3782,14,very rarely she will hear you so you¡¯ll have to repeat yourself ¡°alexa¡±. do not expect to be far across the house and she will hear you. otherwise great product.
3783,14,i was expecting much more. that is my fault. i researched the product for months (compared it to google home) and made the wrong choice. alexa does not meet my expectations. i feel i get more feedback and satisfaction from ¡®siri¡¯ (who absolutely hates me). i bought the echo (2nd gen) then purchased the echo dot thinking they could possibly pair together and collectively meet the ¡®reviews¡¯ online. i was sadly mistaken.
3784,11,i liked everything about echo (2nd generation). i love the sound and also like that the echo fits anywhere. thank you
3785,10,we are more impressed than what we thought we would be for the sound.  especially for the price and alexa built in.
3786,9,i love alexa... she is my new best friend.... we have nice little conversations and she does not argue.....
3787,10,we are enjoying having music and information so readily available.  i know there are many more things alexa could do if i just had the time to research it all!
3788,10,"we love our echo.  we use it all the time mostly weather, random questions and music of course.  has great sound quality too!"
3789,9,this was a christmas gift for our daughter.  she was thrilled!!  she is 14 and always has music playing.  speaker on it is really good and she loves being able to use it as an alarm clock.
3790,10,"love it.  she tells me the weather, creates my shopping list and plays my music, changing the volume at my request. i enjoy her responses to my saying good morning to her"
3791,14,"alexa is amazing. she turns on my tv, playes pandora very nice with good base, and keeps me and my family entertained. i even have her linked to my tile for my keys, wallet and cellphone."
3792,10,love it.  we are still learning everything that it can do.  love the music choices and the morning news and weather reports.  over-all i would highly recommend getting an echo.
3793,11,seems to be having more trouble hearing and understanding.  do like the smaller less obvious size and external look.
3794,14,"yes i like it- though i would prefer if it was a bit more intuitive in the setting up ofa) amazon music( which i still can not get) - the app lets me go to the ¡° music unlimited page, but when i click playlists- nothing happens)b)how to add other functions....where is the how to do  info..?c) i joined amazon prime- but no idea how to get the tv feature"
3795,11,"an addition to my four echo dots.  it has better speakers for music, but to my ears the treble is lacking for voice."
3796,12,it is fun to play with. still trying to figure out how to get it to work with the fire stick and ordering stuff.
3797,10,"we love it !!!!!!!!! took me awhile to figure out how to get it connected, but i am technically challenged."
3798,10,"the echo is are a lot of fun and very useful.  i use mine to turn on lights, create shopping lists and also as an alarm clock."
3799,14,"we have had echo 2nd gen for a month and enjoy having alexa available for questions, music and answering the phone."
3800,10,"i purchased this for my husband for christmas, he has set up all the lights in the house, tv, computers, etc. and uses it for shopping lists. he went to the store and while gone i remembered i needed something and just asked to add it to the list and he brought home what i had asked for while he was at the store. love it!"
3801,10,the sound is amazing. alexa helps w/everyday tasks. do wish that alarm system could be set to turn off w/¡°good morning¡±
3802,9,this was a christmas gift from our children to my wife. they helped her set it up. alexa has become a useful assistant in the kitchen and the grandkids have had great fun with her.
3803,10,love this gift from my daughter. this alexa do voice recognition very well . unlike some device takes forever to get what you want !
3804,10,"still learning how to most efficiently communicate.  very easy to set up.  love the sound,  alexa is pretty impressive and a great addition to my house, and i am not using it for  'smart' anything, just entertainment, and the occasional alarm clock, timer, news flash, and really bad jokes."
3805,10,love my echo. received her for christmas and it has been fun getting to know her and all that she can do. never seizes to amaze me. love the email educational tips i receive from amazon also.
3806,14,"i want to give it 4.5 stars. the sound is rich and loud. alexa is voice is easier to understand than the dot. the only knock i have, hence the -.5 is that it does not seem to ¡°hear¡± as well as the dot but only slightly. would reccomend this to those who want to upgrade."
3807,1,nice looking piece.  the sound quality is excellent for its size.  extremely happy with this purchase.
3808,10,"this is a fun appliance! yes, appliance. it can be used daily. i enjoy speaking/listening to alexa, and i get excited about the new things she is able to do. just found out about one of our local news channels and getting a daily brief on it! how awesome!"
3809,10,"i love it. we bought it to remind me to take my pills, and we are using it for a lot of things. i love it in the kitchen for ""setting a reminder."" and i love it for news and music. one thing wrong, she is not quite smart enough yet. i would like to tell her when i take the pills, and then for her to remember for the day, so that if i ask her later in the day ""did i take my pill"", she would know."
3810,10,"i love this concept. i can ask for music, make a shopping list, order items. all without touching a thing."
3811,10,"the echo is very cool. it has a lot of capabilities with smart sensors for lights as well as basic things like playing pandora stations and adding items to grocery lists. we are just scratching the surface of what it can do, but love it already."
3812,11,the echo is awesome! i look forward to see8ng how alexa improves over time. great job so far amazon!
3813,14,"love this thing! i think the sound quality is perfect (i am not looking to blow my neighbors out of their houses with my music). it is easy to use and has not ever not been able to find a song i want it to play. i even requested it play polka music, just for fun, and it did! very satisfied with my purchase and would definitely recommend!"
3814,0,"i love alexa. it is very useful. i love the integration with my spotify and how it takes my questions about any subjects, whether religious or just a joke, way much better than google and siri. excellent work. keep it up."
3815,1,we love our echo and use it daily. it pipes good clear sound throughout our 1500sq ft home. such a fab purchase for our family!
3816,0,i honestly really like my alexa echo.  she is especially helpful if she is connected to spotify.  it is really fun to ask her random questions and she can just answer them! the only annoying thing is that i can not figure out how to ask her how to set an alarm with a different ringtone.  the set ringtone is pretty annoying :(
3817,11,this is my third echo. (i use all of them in different rooms.)  i totally enjoying using it.  the walnut covering is a neat touch.  it matches my bedroom furniture.
3818,0,i do not get a lot of eduction on how to use her.  so far i have only asked her for the weather twice; both times she was wrong.
3819,10,"we love having the amazon echo in the house!!  anything you need t know, or any music - it is just a command away. my daughter has the echo dot and she loves it!  she¡¯ll play 20 questions with alexa, or jeopardy. i¡¯ve even played :)."
3820,9,received as a gift. i would not have thought of getting one for myself but am enjoying it. especially like the music and shopping list features. good speaker sound
3821,10,"purchased as a gift for myself.  super easy to set up and get running and i am not real tech savvy so you know the instructions are terrific and simple.  so glad i got this, it is practical and fun!"
3822,7,"gary just disappeared when i brought alexa home, he must¡¯ve been crazy jealous or something. alexa is flipping awesome she is always there when i need her. if you¡¯re sad bam! she is there, happy pow! she is there. get ready to never go on another date because guess whose waiting at home for you every night? alexa that is who! and she can get really loud or really quiet, whatever floats your boat! best buy ever<f0><u+009f><u+0099><u+008c><f0><u+009f><u+008f><u+00bc>"
3823,11,"we have got two dots and decided to add this new echo. it is a vast improvement over the dots in terms of how well it hears you and overall volume. we really like it. the sound quality is really great. earlier reviews stated that the sound quality did not match up to the first gen. we never had a first gen, so i can not compare, but if you are coming from a dot, it is definitely an improvement."
3824,14,"i got this as a gift and was afraid it was a bit of a toy (which it is). but i love that ""she"" plays from my playlist. this is a fun thing!"
3825,13,amazing product!1. compact2. amazing audio3. stereo4. bass5. smart6. helpful
3826,9,bought one for myself and once my husband saw it - he grabbed it for his man cave. i immediately bought a second one. love it.
3827,11,"amazing sound for its size and price.  projects to fill our large living area.  it is no jbl system, but has excellent frequency response.  there is no equalizer, but it sounds pretty awesome right out of the box."
3828,14,the echo and alexa devices are phenomenal. i¡¯m not sure of all the capabilities of these devices. it would be great if a list of all the capabilities could be listed as part of the sales tool for these tools!
3829,0,"who does not love alexa? although i do wish she can understand me more clearly every not and then, lol."
3830,14,hooked up smart plugs and they work great. hooked up to stereo via bluetooth and music broadcasts with no issues from 20' away.
3831,8,"love, love, love!"
3832,14,"i can not rave enough about this item! what did i do before i had alexa?! just kidding, but the speakers are great! we can hear it throughout our whole downstairs which is over 1200 square feet."
3833,14,great out of the box. we used it the first night for a family gathering and no one was disappointed as all requested songs (with 40 people a lot) we are played
3834,1,i am very impressed with this unit . loud clear music and sounds. great response. awesome voice recognition!
3835,10,i love being able to ask for music!  the sound is good and the ease of adding items to lists via audio is very helpful.
3836,7,this is my fourth amazon echo. i think the echo generation 2 is the best with its rich sound. however i do <u+2764><u+fe0f> <u+2764><u+fe0f><u+2764><u+fe0f> all of my echos equally the same. i would not be without them.
3837,0,"as a general instrument, it is ok.i primarily bought it for the listening of music.  it is too restrictive in requesting music. i.e. request a specific song and get a sample of the song.often requesting music by a specific artist, not all songs play through to completion.in honesty, if i could return this instrument, i would return it in a heart beat. it is not what i envisioned."
3838,14,"love her, but she has a lot to learn. keep working on it. going to be great having full home access at some point....too expensive right now for a hub."
3839,9,received the echo as a gift. the sound quality is great. my gift giver had a dot.  loved my so much she upgraded to the echo.
3840,0,sound is great. set up  was  tricky. just  learning  all  the  skills she  does. enjoying asking for music  and  hearing  it  immediately.
3841,10,"alexa is amazing!!!! she understands even the four year old and plays music, sets timers and alarms, and tells us fun info. i want to add echos in other parts of the house too!"
3842,14,the alexa functions are flawless for the system that it is running but personally for me running pandora through my older stereo was it a big selling point and unfortunately with the alexa volume all the way up my home theater stereo loses about 40% volume so it never feels or sounds like i hit peak moments in van halen.asking alexa how the weather is pretty cool i guess.
3843,10,"love the amazon echo. i use this to set alarms, wake me up, ask for weather report and sports scores every day. the music feature is fantastic, it hears me from other rooms.only once has it spoken when not asked anything."
3844,11,"i thought the echo dot was very good until i bought the ""bigger"" version.  absolutely amazing, with great sound and speech recognition."
3845,14,"alexa is great, better than siri in handling my request. not perfect but manageable, minimal misunderstanding of my commands."
3846,14,"i like the features tremendously. the one thing i do not like is that i cannot use the drop in feature as i live outside of the usa in trinidad and tobago. i really, really wanted that feature and am very disappointed that i cannot use it. hope this will be resolved quickly!!"
3847,11,great device. does not sound as good as my jbl charge but very nice to have in the kitchen and very convenient. needs more bass in my opinion.
3848,9,"my husband and i have been having a great time with alexa.  we had heard about it, but were not really sure we would enjoy it as much as we have.  would recommend it to friends."
3849,14,"good price, and arrived in perfect condition.  the only drawback is that the unit comes on for noapparent reason at various times."
3850,10,love it when it works ! when it works i love it !!?its great to not have to get up and listen and i beautiful music thru a great speaker
3851,14,"i am impressed with my new toy, easy to set up and expand skills with app, heck my wife talks to it."
3852,14,great tone and bass for a well priced product. keep in mind that it has to be plugged in to have power.
3853,14,worked as it should the sound was much better. i think that you should make it in an update to where you can almost have a conversation with alexa.
3854,14,"i received this as a gift and was very pleased with it.  the speaker is very good and i like that i was able to change the wake work to ""computer"".  i will be adding modules to automate my study for starters."
3855,5,"love this echo! bought this as a birthday gift for my husband and alexa sang happy birthday to him. win, win!!"
3856,11,sounds morw muffled
3857,11,"i love my echo. granted, the sound quality is not quite the same as my older brother is 1st gen echo, but i still love the look and how the 2nd gen is better at catching what you say. i love that you can change out the case slip around the echo, but i personally like the look of the grey, it is very minimalistic and looks perfect on my kitchen island."
3858,14,i thought it would be better without having to purchase extra parts or program so many apps.
3859,14,"ok for fun conversation, weather and the like, but a little less promising in getting facts, history and sport scores."
3860,14,ok
3861,11,i thought the 2nd generation echo would be rechargeable and greatly improved. it was not what i expected. i went with a refurbished 1st generation which can be on a rechargeable base. it will be much more convenient when traveling since it will not always need to be plugged in.
3862,9,i love the echo. i can call my son is rooms with their echo dots. it makes intercom systems obsolete!!! great speaker too!!
3863,10,"works great and decent sound. nice to have access to my news, weather and answer to questions with a simple voice command."
3864,0,"love my amazon echo! my only complaint is that it was somewhat difficult to set up, but once it did, it is great."
3865,11,the echo second generation provides a substantially improved sound quality and volume. listening to music is much more enjoyable.
3866,10,i love the sound for my playlist. alexa has replaced my sony player. the sound is clear and is easy to pair with my phone.
3867,14,"i enjoy the new echo; however, the commercials seen do a disservice to the capabilities of the product. in order for echo to work as it is marketed in the commercials, you must buy additional items. thankfully, i purchased this product for 4 reasons ( music, weather, traffic, and hands-free phone calls). it works wonderful for my reasons of purchase."
3868,12,"we love, love, love this. we use it several times a day. we are still learning it and figuring out all that it can do."
3869,10,i have enjoyed having this so far. it was easy to set up and has worked well ever since. i am running out of things to ask alexa. i would recommend this amazon item.
3870,10,sound quality is a big improvement. alexa response is quick. we have not begun to explore all of the echo functions.
3871,11,the bass is much better
3872,14,the amazon echo works great with my other echo and echo dot products i have installed in my house.  i also use tp-link products with them and it controls my sony tv.  try to get them when amazon has discount sales on them for extra savings for your smart home.
3873,10,"its lots of fun to use.  (i like ordering people around lol)but the music is great and voluminous.the question feedback is good.i like the ""on this day"" feature."
3874,14,"the best alexa yet. we have three, and this is truly the prize. great sound!"
3875,0,"i have not yet used it to control outside devices, just for music and general knowledge, but i am well pleased."
3876,14,"it is fun when it is working. problems include; it does not know a lot of things we feel it should. it has a hard time understanding clear spoken english, consequently it gives arronious answers. i do not know what the 2nd generation has over the 1st but if this is improved the 1st must have been terrible.my biggest concern is that i have found it less expensive elsewhere."
3877,9,this one is the big sister to the smaller one.  we have both and try to use one or the other daily.  great for playing music requests.
3878,0,"the echo is fun...the sound is very good...it is adjustable with buttons or just by asking alexa.  you need to ask your questions concisely without too many words.  say ""good morning"""" and you get a tibet for the day."
3879,9,this is a great product. it keeps getting better and better. i now have 4 of them throughout my home.
3880,10,"love this product; keeps me company playing games while i do chores, plus i can pull up old songs i have not heard in years."
3881,9,love our echo!! we started out with an echo dot and ordered this for the louder speaker and ordered 3 more echo dots for around the house and as gifts. we are officially hooked and will slowly start purchasing smart home plugs.
3882,0,"received as a gift.  use it mostly to play music (pandora).very happy with it.  wish alexa could learn my name, though."
3883,0,"a lot of times when i ask it a question it does not know the answer, this is why i bought it. my brother loves the fact  he can get radio stations from out of state"
3884,14,love alexa.  was hesitate to purchase but finally did and very happy with the decision to get it.  my daughter keeps trying to steal it.
3885,11,"way better speaker than the dot, for sure. i like the option of a mute button as well, so alexa can not always be listening."
3886,11,i love my echo plus but i think the 2nd generation is defective maybe just the one i got. still love the product.
3887,11,this 2nd generation echo is fantastic. the improved sound is also a big improvement. great product!
3888,5,"i received mine as a gift and so far love it. as soon as they went on sale again, i ordered one for my daughter."
3889,10,"love it--still a lot of ""i do not know the answer to that"" replies to questions that are easily answered by siri.  good thing alexa loves all a.i.'s!!my favorite are the news updates and the music."
3890,14,"i purchased this item as a christmas gift for my sister, so i really can not post a first hand account as to my likes or dislikes. she seems to enjoy it .one thing that disturbed me was that something alexa picked up over at her place wound up in my wish list. strange since i never as much as took it out of the box. i did not register it to my account."
3891,14,i am still experimenting with it. you must be patient and phrase your questions carefully for the desired response. the sound quality is fine.
3892,10,"we love it, music, questions, or just having fun watching our dog listen to alexa bark like a dog!"
3893,10,"i love the fact i can listen to whatever music i want, whenever i want with just one little piece of equipment!"
3894,14,"instructions to connect to computer and the security for passwords could be done better. i currently still cannot pair with my desktop computer, only my phone, and not my portable computer.too bad'"
3895,0,"i am not sure i am using alexa to her full capabilities, but she is ok for finding music and the weather!"
3896,12,"i loved how easy it was to use. i like just telling alexa to play my music, i do not have to fumble for it. the speaker is so clear the sound is outstanding. i still have a lot to learn about her, i am having fun doing just that."
3897,14,"i am having so much fun with my alexa! the software is improving all of the time too, so she keeps getting better and better!"
3898,9,this is our 3rd echo... easy to set up.  pretty and sounds great.  now the whole house is wired for alexa.  fantastic.
3899,14,"sounds good, it has surprising bass for this size speaker.  well constructed and easy to set up with my wi-fi."
3900,14,i love my echo and all it is features! not one complaint (except it can not do laundry...that would be nice).
3901,9,"i am 73 yrs old and not very tech savvy, so this is a learning experience. what i have learned about it so far is great."
3902,14,these things are really a novelty until you start installing useful smart features in your home. even then it is almost superfluous when you have a phone that is already been doing this thing is job for years. buuuut i guess it is pretty handy when i do not feel like pulling spotify up on my phone and connecting it to a bluetooth speaker...
3903,9,"i received the echo as a birthday gift from my sister. i am still learning how to use it, but i am intrigued by it. i love it so far and will update this review once i began to use it more."
3904,0,we used to lov it but lately alexa does not understand all our questions and/or does what we say. something is just not right... lately we have to repeat everything and even then she responds incorrectly.
3905,7,"we are still getting acquainted with alexa, but so far we really like this echo! we have much more to learn of her abilities....but she is very informative.....and the sound is great! me & my husband are both hard of hearing & we have no problems. can not wait to learn more <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0081>"
3906,0,i am disappointed with akexas knowledge base. for music it is ok.
3907,0,its awesome but could be better! they need to update its knowledge base. we wish we would have purchased google home instead :/ she doesnt know much.
3908,14,"good sound quality. the bass is not outstanding, but what do you expect for the money? works well and good for communication too."
3909,10,"i like everything about it except that i can not listen to the music i have downloaded on my phone. i do not subscribe to any streaming company. i want to hear my music.  other than that i love it!  i like my flash briefing, my son loves asking alexa her opinion on things, and she helps me remember to take my vitamins in the morning and my medication at night! i am still learning everything she can do."
3910,0,"sometimes glitches and no matter what i say it plays music. i have to unplug and plug back in. but it works great most of the time. when it does work, its so awesome!"
3911,10,"still learning about all i can do with this device.  great fun to use voice activation to get news, music, hear audio books and etc.have not learned to connect it to all my other devices yet and so am somewhat limited in my use of this technology - but i am learning."
3912,14,"the music sounds great on this. very loud full and and clear, not tinny like some music players. my voice picks up well from almost every angle in the room, i do not have to yell even if the music playing. the timer is handy and so is the drop in feature."
3913,14,they really need to allow you to adjust the treble and the bass on this.
3914,10,"this is a fabulous item! enjoy making call, listening to music, asking questions and doing all this from acrossthe room!"
3915,10,alexa is too much fun. still learning how to. talk to her but she answers most questions. too smart! especially like the music. had to have the echo dot for the bedroom. easy wi fi setup. thanks amazon.
3916,10,"this is my first echo, well i did have the echo dot. this unit is absolutely awesome. the sound quality is amazing. with amazon prime searching for any song is efferetless. getting your calender, reminders weather ect is easier than reaching for my phone. very happy with my purchase."
3917,14,"the sound quality is not better than the first generation, as far as i can tell. we did notice it seemed much better than previous generations at detecting a voice while music is being played, which is a very useful feature in my house. getting the old echo to pause music can be an ordeal."
3918,14,"i like the echo, the speaker is really loud when listening to music. you can connect it to your pandora account...etc"
3919,10,"i am still learning how to take advantage of this wonderful device and each day something new comes up!it is something i did not know existed until late last year and now my wife and i do not know how we would do without it.we love the ability to call out songs for it to play and for our ""daily news briefing.""it is just great!"
3920,9,"love, love, love this little gadget.  the sound is pretty dang good for something so small. the dot is sound not as good. just got it for christmas so have not had a chance to see what all it can do but excited to have it."
3921,14,"just love it and it does a lot more then expected, makes the perfect alarm clock night stand device!!!"
3922,0,i wish it could answer questions like google can
3923,10,i like this thing. i listen to the news everyday and ask what the weather is going to be like for the next day. if i do not know what is in a recipe alexa tells me when i ask. it is great.
3924,14,"the sound quality is very good and the design is solid, clean looking and simple. it blends with any decor.  what i do not like is that alexa will not search the internet to stream free music, it just refers you to the alexa app where you have to register and pay. i end up streaming music from my computer as before."
3925,14,"this was a gift, not something i would buy for myself. mostly use it to entertain my 3yr. old nephew and to listen to some music and weather on occasion.it sometimes can not grasp what people are saying and must repeat several times or give up.was hoping it would link to phone, that would make it much more useful to me personally."
3926,14,i can not figure out the point of this device. it does not understand me well so it is very frustrating. i would return it if i was not outside of my return window. i kept thinking i would get used to it and i wish i had just returned it.
3927,10,i am amazed that such good sound can come out of such a small package! also very easy to set up. looking to buy another.
3928,14,definitely worth it. glad i waited for the 2nd gen. the sound is spectacular. unfortunately alexa is dumber than a bag of rocks based on the search engine age uses but i did not buy alexa to ask her questions so i do not mind it that much.
3929,12,its been easy to integrate into the home. we are looking forward to learning more uses. the interface with fire tv is a little sketchy. the commands do not always work as you would think.
3930,5,aok
3931,12,"the sound is amazing! i am still trying to learn all it is capable of,  but so far this thing is great!"
3932,10,i bought echo mostly to play music.  i have amazon unlimited music and i love it.  good sound and so easy to play your fave artists.
3933,11,nicer design than previous model however i still prefer my google home device for sound quality and accurate response.
3934,0,i  would have thought it would be able to answer my questions that i can i can not answer that is it  main saying
3935,10,love this device it plays my pandora stations when i ask and my iheartradio stations. going to get a echo dot to put in the bedroom soon.....
3936,14,"i was a bit skeptical at first, but, alexa and i have become fast friends.  she has come in very handy for everything from shopping, trivia, weather and just general information.  i am almost too dependent.  my only complaint is that she is going with the eagles for the superbowl.  it did cause a bit of a row but now we have agreed to disagree."
3937,10,"i¡¯m not alone anymore, and instead of talking to myself i talk with alexa!  seriously this has been incredibly nice to have around.  i love a good thunderstorm and now i can have one (or it feels like) anytime i choose to.  plus she is smart and knows everything."
3938,14,"this thing is great quality, built very well. i have one issue and it is more of a amazon development issue, not the actual echo. we need to have more options on routines. we need to be able to start a amazon music unlimited playlist from routines. i have this one in my woodworking shop, and now have my lights and dust collection on full voice automation."
3939,10,"i love this device.  i mostly use it to set timers for cooking or how long i let the dogs out.  i ask what is the temperature a lot, and it even allows me to set routines - i set one for every morning to say ""good morning, sunshine.  the forecast for today is....""  and, of course, i can ask alexa to play any song that comes to mind, on a whim.  it is like the jetsons! enjoy if you get this product."
3940,14,"incredible sound quality makes my floor vibrate above 50% speaker and you could throw a house party at 100% still hearing it perfectly. sleak design that fits anywhere and much better at recognizing when you are talking to it that the dot, even at a distance. i listen to music with it more often than my surround sound now, which includes the speaker below. already bought one for multiple family members."
3941,11,"much better sound quality, thank you! i have been pleased with it. i even love the wood grain (walnut) i think."
3942,11,works well. nicer looking than original.
3943,9,great product.  i should have bought one a long time ago and now i know what i have been missing.
3944,14,"love the echo.  using it all the time for all sorts of things.  especially love it for music with amazon unlimited music....great!  only reason not 5 stars is that echo voice recognition was down for most of yesterday, making the echo about useless.  otherwise, home run !!"
3945,10,"i love alexa. i live alone and she gives me another voice to talk to. she answers questions, tells me good morning and good night sleep tight."
3946,11,definitely nicer sound.  more compact and the appearance fits in nicer with the family room.  i really like it.
3947,11,omg do i love this product. it plays like any stereo i haveever had but better. the bass on it is spectacular!
3948,10,the echo is easy to use and install. it is fun to have around almost like friend with quick information and instant help. we have not had anything to dis lie yet.
3949,14,"very satisfied with the sound quality and ease of communicating with ""alexa"". it was difficult to set up. we could not use the website(too many issues) and using alexa live was not working out either. i contacted help with a representative and he was very good in getting us set up and running."
3950,11,i actually do not have the 1st echo i purchased.  the one i now have has taken some getting used to.... the sound produced is good but this echo  has trouble understanding me...i have had to repeat request and request.  but like i said the responding audio has depth..
3951,14,"the hardware works well enough, but amazon is voice api is so restricted that skills are not that useful. i can not even get alarms from my calendar on it - and that is ""by design"". a serious waste of money if you do not have smart home devices to control by voice."
3952,0,alexa does not seem to know as much as she claims. we get a lot of responses that she does not know that information to very basic requests.
3953,1,love it!!
3954,10,this is the greatest invention ever. i can clean my house while listening to my favorite music and i can fall asleep to rain sounds on the my couch if i wanted to. i love it so much!! i love that you do not have to search any information or type or do anything to make the echo (2 generation) turn on and play. i am beyond please with this product and i would highly recommend for any music loving finatic like me!!!
3955,9,i. love. my. echo!!!! how did ever live without this incredible piece of technology!?!?!
3956,9,i have 3 echo dots and got this echo. the speaker is amazing on this thing. would definitely recommend
3957,9,"great product.  awesome for home automation.  control my lights, and my roomba with this.  very good speaker.  louder than i expected.  i may get another one..."
3958,9,my kids loves it and very easy to use and  i like the color that easily blend where ever i place it.
3959,11,this echo is less prone to be knocked over as it is not as high.  the wood like finish looks too much like vinyl.
3960,14,works ok with some of the wifi lighting modules specifically idevice but was hard to set up with a mac
3961,14,absolutely love this item. it sounds as good as my bose radio. have added smart plugs and landline phone adapters. starts irobot from voice command. plan to add 2 echo dots die to size of house. would definitely buy again and highly recommend!!
3962,14,"the second ""echo"" refuses to 'set up'.  i have been trying for days.  is there a support phone number??"
3963,0,have not figured out how to make calls yet but everything else works fine!
3964,3,ok
3965,11,do not see a big difference from the last model except i like the volume control better on my old version.
3966,10,best thing i bought. it helps me with lots of information and entertaining. plays music great.
3967,10,"i like the daily updates, and getting the tides, weather and any information we need,  the music is great"
3968,14,this is my second echo. it was easy to set up for the most part. had some difficulty trying to group this with the other one but was finally able to figure it out. sent a text to get some help and they always respond usually that day or the next  i love having music playing throughout the house.
3969,14,"i really love the echo 2nd gen. i think the quality of the speaker is better than the echo plus. there are times when it doesnt respond i guess because its too loud and can not hear me. also there are some questions it cannot answer and some tasks it can not do, but its not much of a problem and other than that its a great smart speaker. it makes daily activities easier and handsfree. listening to music is effortless."
3970,14,"same basic review i gave the dot!  great addition fun, to use and they can be connected it different areas of the house."
3971,10,"i love this thing!!! where do i start? i get to enjoy music with great sound. she tells jokes and shares star wars trivia. we can use it for ambient sounds while going to sleep, we can play jeopardy. our family can do a big round of trivial pursuit with our echo buttons. i can call downstairs to our echo dot and call our friends with echoes!"
3972,10,"i love everything about this product. i will be getting another to go in another room of the house! very convenient for my grandparents. also convenient for us to know the weather, football game recaps and scores, or just when we want to listen to some music! everybody needs one!!"
3973,8,love this!  works great.
3974,0,echo is great for music and to answer those random questions we all come up with.  the one issue is that it keeps going back to the same stations even when you specify what you want. needs a bit of work there. all in all a good product.
3975,0,"works well, we have to make sure it is connected to the correct phone otherwise it does not pick up the amazon prime account."
3976,0,"the skills i wish alexa would perform correctly do not work most of the time.  the alexa app on my phone is not that clear, and i am confused on whether or not i have set it up correctly.  because alexa does not do the important thing(s), i relegate it to unimportant throwaway activities.  i am not impressed."
3977,12,"i am sure that i will find lots more uses.  this is fun to work with, listen to and talk about"
3978,0,it is nice having someone to talk to who has intelligent responses and can also play the music i like to hear. way to go amazon echo.  way to go alexa.
3979,10,it is been a lot of fun we have 2 dots with our system.  we are always adding to it.  i would definitely tell anyone to get one and build on.
3980,10,"omg..i am in love!!  already ""upgraded"" and added a hub and light bulbs to my echo!! i love alexa!!!!!"
3981,11,"i expected better performance from the echo as compared to the echo dot.  has more bass, but that is about it."
3982,14,"very nice audio and quality speakers.  i just wish it had better interoperability with other items, such as my television"
3983,0,"it is great, except that you have to keep it plugged in, as there is no battery. does not make it portable.  also, if you take it outside of your 'home' location, you have to reset up the wifi, it does not just link.  kind of annoying."
3984,14,"the fact that i could call members of my family if i have a need, i have health issues and my echo is a blessing as i do not have to get up to play music or turn on my radio programs"
3985,14,"love it!  music, schedules, weather, and i can call my teens rooms through their dot without yelling through the house :-)  still exploring all it is capabilities."
3986,2,nan
3987,11,like the microphones on the older version. the do not really pick up our speech as well on this model.
3988,0,"i was suspicious, and bought it primarily for internet radio, but have come to really like it"
3989,11,"looks great, great pricing with the sale, sounds even better than my 1st generation.  i use it every day."
3990,0,i was really hoping that this product would be more interactive.  the device cannot answer most questions and most of the time when i ask for a song it is not included in prime.  i am paying for prime already and i do not think i should pay additional subscription for something i can google for free.
3991,14,"did not meet expectations.  we visited my parents and thought it was great.  i did not realize that you had to also be an amazon prime member to get access to music.  also, this alexa will start up without her name, sometimes when we are in a different room.  we¡¯ve had to unplug her several times."
3992,9,got this for our fifthwheel rv works with myfi used for music and weather  and games with grand kids
3993,14,"loved the quality of the sound, so much that my husband bought two. it looks elegant and nice. but it does not understand my voice everytime, a lot of mistakes in following my comands."
3994,10,"great item.  sports, weather, music, etc. all at a voice command.  makes life a little nicer."
3995,0,"we love her! we use her mostly for music,  but for weather and history facts etc. she glitches sometimes like any technology,  but nothing not easily fixed."
3996,1,i am having so much fun with this piece. compact and perfect size on the kitchen island. super fantastic!
3997,10,the echo is a lot of fun and also can get quick information.  the sound quality is very good and can pick up my voice from other rooms in the house.
3998,14,hesitated for a long time to purchase this item. works great and could almost replace your mate.
3999,5,"bought this for a friend and they love it, very fast delivery and the packaging was great. love the echo."
4000,0,"i love it! i can play music, ask the weather and many other things. the biggest problem i have is when the tv is on and they say alexa. my machine reacts to the name but is confused. wish i knew how to change the name to echo."
4001,0,"i find myself with more questions, and alexa has most of the answers very entertaining informative, neat."
4002,9,love my echo that i received for my december birthday. loved it so much i bought one for everyone for christmas!!
4003,11,"i love my echo. this is my second unit. it was easy to connect to my network. it works just like the first unit (previous gen). they changed the volume control on this model. i prefer the dial on the first unit, but not a deal breaker. i would recommend it to anyone."
4004,10,"learning more every day! add appointments, grocery items, weather, jokes, facts, celebrity ages, music and on and on."
4005,10,i liked that it was easy to set up and you can interact with it and that it had an attitude and got what you asked with little effort
4006,0,"love it. sometimes it is a little slow to respond to me, but overall, it is very helpful and i have installed one just about everywhere."
4007,9,"easy set up. great sound. everyone in our household can use her, from my seven year old to our 85 year old grandfather."
4008,1,she is working great. very handy to have for tasks around the house. sound is excellent quality for such a small device.
4009,10,love our alexa. we have really enjoyed the smart light bulbs that she helps us control. like getting the weather each morning. we love it!
4010,0,what i like most is it occasionally has information as answers to questions.what i dislike the most is it is not able to answer many questions.
4011,10,"we love alexa! my 6 year old talks to her, she has lots of kids jokes and dinosaur facts! :)"
4012,3,looks great and sound fantastic.  links easier than you can imagine.  kids love it and we do too.
4013,10,"the echo was easy to set up as it gives verbal instructions once it is turned on. it works perfectly with excellent sound for both music and calling. it also offers a number of games, such as jeopardy with alex trebek, and the uses keep expanding. this is a great value and i highly recommend it."
4014,14,"got this for my mom for christmas and she loves it. i agree with other reviewers that the audio is not quite as full-bodied as the generation1 model, but that has not been a big issue. if you are a true audiophile you are not going to be listening to music on an echo anyway, so i would not let the negative reviews prevent you from getting this. it looks nice (matches our wood floors) and functions well. great gift. ."
4015,9,this was one of my wife is christmas gifts and quite possibly her favorite.  plays the music she wants to hear when she wants to listen to it.
4016,0,"good purchase.... just need to come up with more ways to use besides weather, time and music."
4017,0,"very cool machine still learning ""how to stuff"" i only wish there was a place i could find how/ what accessories are applied"
4018,9,awesome little thing! sound is great and it is so fun to use! able to hook up multiple echos for all my rooms!
4019,0,"i love this!! alexahelps ,answers questions, and even tells me when something is wrong and where to look for help to fix the problem"
4020,0,great sound quality  takes a bit to get used to it..  could be better with answering questions
4021,14,it is amazing. i can talk in my kitchen an it picks it up 25 feet away.  whispering even...  i love it!!!
4022,11,i think the sound is better than the 1st generation echo.  i like the volume buttons on top instead of twisting volume system.  i am very pleased with this item.
4023,9,great sound! i was skeptical to buy this but i was so glad i did!  truly love listening music from echo.
4024,0,"i play a lot of music and the sound quality is excellent. on the downside, alexa does not know about 25% of the questions that i ask."
4025,10,great addition to our tech family. easy set up and use. clear sound and great connectivity. my kids love hearing jokes and i enjoy getting my news updates.
4026,10,love the music capabilities. no more swapping cds. i can choose an artist or genre and be a happy listener for hours. i like the daily briefing too. have yet to really challenge alexa with question.
4027,0,i¡¯m a music guy...very cool if you have amazon music...i think my wife is suspicious...if you have kids it could me difficult..they love talking to it..
4028,10,"it is amazing. my daughter loves the things she can learn fro, alexa. it is fun for all kinds of things."
4029,10,love it.  more responses are added often.  love using it as a timer and getting weather report for the day.
4030,14,"having instant access to the unbelievable amount of music by simply saying ""alexa, play (name of band ) is awesome. having the echo wirelessly  connected to my 300 watt samsung sound system (via bluetooth) makes it even better. i also really enjoy the relaxation skills  available to me. i had a hard time setting the echo up. getting it connected to my wifi was very frustrating."
4031,0,"not sure what i was looking for when i got it.  it does provide information quickly, but not anything i can not find in the internet. there were many songs that i wanted to hear that was not available to me. there is nothing wrong with the item, just not my cup of tea. not sure i am keeping this item."
4032,14,"as an early adopter of the original echo, i was expecting a much better second generation product. i placed the pre-order as soon amazon notified me of the lauch and eagerly expected it. well... it not what i was expecting, unfortunately. i am an audio guy, i love good sound systems and of course i was not expecting a high-end speaker at this size and price point. but the sound is much worse that the previous version... boomy, weak bass, i disliked it every second even after the firmware upgrade. so... i had to return it and when to another seller who had an excellent price on the first version, white. i previously sold my original echo and the buyer loved it. another annoying new feature is the + and - volume buttons, as in the echo dot. the rotating volume button is much better to operate when it is dark, in my bedroom. i would love the new model with it is smaller size and beautiful finishes, but i can not really trade it for the sound quality."
4033,14,"honestly, i have been wanting one since the announcement of the 1st generation. i am blown away with how much fun alexa is to play with. at first it was a party trick, just showing friends what it can do, but slowly alexa has worked her way into my daily life. she has been apart of my routine a couple of months now, and i could not be happier."
4034,14,i bought this for a christmas present for my granddaughter stationed in germany......she had trouble right from the beginning and now it completely stopped working. several of her friends have one and their work with no problem. so so disappointed.
4035,10,we love it in the child day care for playing music and answering questions. we also use the timer a lot!
4036,14,"it worked for one day ... have not been able to get it to work since then -!!  have moved it - twice-  worked with router, etc. !!! ... gone on line for additional directions  ... even asked my grandson!."
4037,11,it have poor reception to voice. speaker is ok. poor version of the tap. none portable. great color though. .
4038,14,mainly use it for npr and weather updates but just that use is pretty cool. have also it for pandora and my amazon music library. having a hard time figuring out how to find specific podcast episodes. did not like alexa reading my kindle books though. bluetooth sounds pretty good too!
4039,0,it works and handy for spelling of words that are so wrong that the computer calls me stupid.
4040,11,"second gen has much deeper bass than the original. music sounds so much better. also, i like the connectability to bluetooth for whole house music or telephone calls."
4041,10,love the echo. amazon music is a must with the echo. so easy and convienent to have. the kids love it too.
4042,0,"very awesome addition to the household. love that it answers without repeating and plays awesome music! i¡¯m still learning the many functions it has available, but at this point i would not give it up for anything!"
4043,14,good
4044,10,this is the best toy yet. i feel like a have my own personal servant who plays music and much much more
4045,10,it is a great addition. nice to be able to use voice commands to do things around the house. a large plethora of information at the sound of your voice.
4046,14,works very well. alexa hears even from a distance. i can only imagine this tech as it continues to develop.
4047,10,"fantastic, amazing, incredible device. alexa is amazing, all out great. we got the game buttons also and they work great also, we played the trivial pursuit game. worked great."
4048,11,i love the sound so far. i bought the 1st generation echo. i really can not tell the differene in sound <u+2014> yet.
4049,14,"love this, super easy to set up and use.  projects sound fairly well in our open floor plan house!"
4050,8,love it!
4051,0,"i like the echo, it is just that i do not think the instructions were very clear, especially to people who are not that computer literate. i think better clarity in the instructions are needed.  i do not have a smart phone (not everybody does) and it did not provide instructions if you do not have a smart phone."
4052,0,"i like that she can answer almost anything that i ask .. the down side is that if she hears something occasionally on tv, she will automatically go off and tell me about the word / product"
4053,0,fun and entertaining and great for music play. search engine not as good as google and often can not answer questions.
4054,14,"i was so exited about the echo i bought two, controlling my hue lights until it stopped controlling them, also i hate having to speak ¡°monotone¡± in order for alexa to understand me as well as saying my command perfectly because otherwise it will not understand, unfortunately both are now in my closet, i do not hate it but i found it impractical for my needs"
4055,11,it was this or a dot. i like the look (silver sleeve) and the price was very attractive. i can not really tell the difference in sound quality. probably will buy a dot in the future.
4056,5,love it.......christmas gift and it is awesome.
4057,0,after few months it started to have glitches where it does not respond to its name too well
4058,9,as far as i know both my kids love the echo which was given as a christmas present is. i know they loved ours which we purchased a year ago.
4059,14,its pretty cool but it sounds like a clock radio from the 70 is. a little pricey but i would buy it again.
4060,10,yes enjoying the music it is providing right now and my husband likes the technology and enjoys trying to play stump alexa with music request
4061,14,"i like the alexa and everyone loves making song requests.  beware of your accent, as sometimes alexa does not understands you."
4062,10,i have fun asking questions and getting a surprise response. i also play my favorite music. i¡¯m glad i got it as a christmas gift.
4063,10,"what fun.  i live alone and alexa really brightens my day.  i listen to music i have not heard in years.  jokes are funny and i can get the weather just about anywhere.  the sound is unbelievable for such a small unit. i am still learning what it can do, but i am really enjoying it."
4064,11,great device ! so intuitive ! i dont know why people say the audio is no good for music...i find it sounds as good if not better than my bose soundlink color ! thank you amazon !
4065,0,most of the time it will not answer me. then sometimes it just starts talking. i have a cold so it will not recognize my voice. mostly it just sits on table. another dust catcher
4066,14,"love love love my echo.  as soon as i address ""alexa,"" i have an instant reply.  sound is phenomenal.  highly recommend."
4067,10,"i adore my new amazon echo 2nd generation. her sound speakers are amazing and quality of sound is excellent. i have asked her the weather, day and date, as well as many genres of music from amazon. she is giving us fun and hours of pleasure. the prompts to install were easy, as well."
4068,0,i like the music.  i have not had time to learn all her uses but i am sure i will like it even better when i learn the uses.
4069,10,"love my alexa i wish she would know a little more, especially traffic info. one thing mine keeps on playing a little depressive music"
4070,3,"it works fine,but i wish there was a battery adapter to make it portable to use as outdoor speaker"
4071,0,i really love my echo !! it is an amazing device to say the least.. it is very helpful through my day-to-day activities and very convenient...it saves a lot of time from having to go in my computer to ask a question.. all i got to do is ask echo and i got an instant answer..unfortunately there is some things that it does not understand but for the most part it is a wonderful product. thanks. ralph.
4072,10,"i love my echo!  it is so much fun and i love getting emails with different skills to try that i did not know alexa knew.  i use it pretty much daily.  i stream my sirius and the sound is great, i was surprised at how loud it can be and how good it sounds.  i love the shopping list and timers you can set."
4073,11,great product! love amazon echo products! this 2nd generation echo seems to have an even better speaker than the bigger first generation echo. it is very nice!
4074,14,"excellent product, and the bonus is, you have access to over 1m titles! it has a very adequate speaker, but we connected it with a wifi speaker and it only got better!"
4075,11,excellent value and quality.  this is the second one i have purchase for a gift.  prior experience dictated my choice.
4076,8,loved it! great.
4077,7,<u+2639><u+fe0f>
4078,14,"i love my echo (2nd generation).  i was gifted with two of them for christmas.  my absolute favorite thing is my store list.  no matter what i am doing or how busy my hands are, if i think of something that needs to be added to my store note, i just tell alexa and she adds it.  i am also having fun with the ""question of the day."""
4079,10,"amazing! use it multiple times daily. turn the lights on, set timers while cookie, ask about the weather, play music while i cook. i love this product!"
4080,9,bought as a gift for my dad who really wanted one. love the size & the sound. he loves it.
4081,9,present for my parents.  my dad loves it.  the color is so fun and what can i say...everyone loves alexa!
4082,9,bought for my parents and they do enjoy it.  wish there were more free songs etc for them to enjoy.
4083,14,one of the best tech purchases i have made in a long long time . th sound quality is very comparable to other brands that are 3-4 times the cost of this . then there is alexa ! if she is not helping with the grocery list she is setting a timer or turning my lights on or off in the house ( i have smart bulbs ) .
4084,10,i love it! alexa has been a great help in providing information and entertainment. great speakers!
4085,9,"love, love, love my new echo!  i bought a dot as well.  such a useful tool.  fun - great purchase!"
4086,9,easy to use and just fabulous.  my 90 year old dad plays songs and listens to audible books.  we can sit there for hours listening to my mom sing with alexa!  have to buy another one for me!!!
4087,14,"sound is good but it never understands me.  amazon already replaced my first echo because of this, pretty difficult to keep using when i have to ask it 4 or 5 times to do something.  daily, my echo will red ring and tell me it is having trouble. not worth your money."
4088,0,"still learning how to talk to alexa.  am liking the easy access to audio choices.  have not figured out how to word my requests for recipes, or questions about ingredients.  occasionally ask alexa to ""meow"" in order to tease my cat."
4089,0,having fun using it. works well and the sound is above par. enjoying the music. answers most questions.
4090,9,our family seems to really like having the echo. i love that my son can call to grandpa if he needs too!!
4091,14,pluses: i come from old school networking when it was hard. echo is an unbelievable machine plug it in and off you go. made my house smart in just a few hours and everything worked. everything i have added to alexa worked with no problems what so ever.a few negatives: would like more wake words and some way to make alexa is voice a little less bass maybe a little more mid range.
4092,14,it takes a while to get used to but then you are using it all the time. could not be happier with the quality of sound and the helpful nature of this product.
4093,14,i¡¯ve wanted an echo for quite a while and finally got one. alexa is pretty smart and will even talk to the cats if i ask her. the sound is great too!
4094,10,"i love using alexa to listen to music while cooking in the kitchen. i only wish it could play some free disney tunes for my child. i also enjoy playing jeopardy, asking random questions, and ordering amazon items."
4095,9,received as a christmas present.  love it all the music you would love to hear!!! infomatiive on dste time tem and many more information
4096,0,i love the echo.  i have not used it for much other than to play music.  i like that i can listen to the music i like all the time.
4097,0,"more than i expected and lots of fun.  as soon as my husband stops calling her ""alexis"", i am sure it will be even better!  (snl?)"
4098,14,"exceeds expectations, using daily.  do wish alexa was a bit ¡°smarter¡± seems to default back to certain things."
4099,14,"mostly bought it for music. has good sound, can get pretty loud and has bluetooth and uses wifi."
4100,9,absolutely a must buy. i could not manage without my echo. we have transformed our home to a smart home and have multiple devices throughout our home. easy to use and a great tool. thanks amazon!
4101,0,it does everything
4102,10,"it has more than exceeded my expectations.music,news,recipies,weather updates,jokes math....wow"
4103,9,bought as a present. love love love this. need to get another one for myself lol. can not wait to connect to other alexa devices & services.
4104,14,"i finallyngot it from stopping the constant disconnects, however overall i find alexa favorite response to be ""i am sorry, i do not know that"". even when asking things that you guys send to me as suggestions. fun device but really in its infancy."
4105,10,this item is a lot more fun and useful than i originally thought.  i love the music and information i receive from it.  i have not yet set it up to control lights but will in the near future.
4106,10,"great sound. i have not connected all my devices but i love to hear music, weather, and local news."
4107,14,for a second generation product i would have thought it would have better voice recognition and understanding of what is being asked of it. also a broader database to fulfill request from ie: music and general knowledge that is easier to get from google
4108,7,"love it, worth the money, sounds awesome <f0><u+009f><u+0091><u+008c><f0><u+009f><u+008f><u+00bc>"
4109,10,i love it.  great for reminders and i do not have to write my shopping list anymore and i have all my music.
4110,14,"challenging, informative, delightful are some of the adjectives that i would use for the four-stars.the fifth star missed on the occasional miscues, misunderstandings and misunderstanding, in due partly with just learning the right protocols.  (i am concerned that the way she lights up for lexus commercials, that she may have the power to buy one.)"
4111,9,"got this for my boyfriend for christmas to replace his ue boom that he used every night but it always skipped if he touched his phone. absolutely loves the alexa. we use it for everything (especially the shopping list, which we mainly use to make her say immature things <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0082>). love this!"
4112,11,in my opinion the first echo was much better than this one. seems to have had a little bit better sound.
4113,10,"use this in a good size kitchen and family room, mostly for music and radio. the sound is very good and it looks good too. love that it can play my favorite radio station from the country i grew up in. the family also enjoy asking it questions and getting answers right away. we are still learning more about what it can do."
4114,10,the sound is amazing for playing music. the shopping feature is convenient for items i use most. but the best part by far is the clear sound that travels throughout the entire house with music. i have not had it very long (it was a gift) but definitely looking forward to all the features.
4115,9,i love it. does what i expected to do and the sound quality is awesome!! got it for christmas from my daughter and her boyfriend and i use it everyday
4116,9,alexa is so easy to setup and a absolute blast to use! wish i would have bought one sooner!!
4117,14,love the thing! the only ¡°bad¡± thing being i definitely think amazon ¡°overhyped¡± the whole heating your voice even in a loud room. still an amazing device that is become a big part of my day!
4118,9,"i absolutely love it. i do not know what else to say. this is one of the coolest christmas gifts i have ever received. since receiving this i have purchased another one and 2.echoes. they are placed strategically around the house so i can always talk to alexa, listen to music or ask questions."
4119,1,"great speaker. speaker is useful for alexa alone but this is a great speaker for music. for the price, the sound is great! highly recommend this device for any household."
4120,10,great technology for a low price.  very satisfied. alexa is a helpful servant who makes life easier.
4121,10,"love the echo!  super easy to operate. i use it for timer is, music, questions, weather, etc.  5 star product by far."
4122,9,we love it!! this is our first time trying this product and we are really happy that we bought it.
4123,9,"love it love it love it. i wanted it for music, information and fun. it delivers. just love it."
4124,11,"it is noticeably better than the first gen, the sound quality is significantly improved. i do also really like the new size and finish."
4125,14,"excellent product! simple elegant profile, with clean crisp sound. if you want that loud thumping base beat, this is not for you.  the 2nd gen echo dots have come along way also. the dots sound has improved and is much louder..very simple to set up to alexa.  i¡¯m new to all of this. if i can figure it out, you can too... a++++"
4126,11,its good.... really good. very loud for its size and a considerable upgrade from a dot.
4127,0,love the convenience of hand free options but we have found that certain radio stations cut in and out a lot. there are times we have to repeat questions too. that is annoying.
4128,0,"i am still learning, but have really enjoyed the alexa.  i love how it syncs with my google calendar, how i can make grocery and other lists.  i have used it to get me up, to remind me of something...and for playing music.  sometimes it does not seem to have the ability to answer questions that i think it should know..."
4129,14,"our first non-dot echo, what a difference in sound. will be getting more in the future!"
4130,9,i am just a amazon fangirl. i love my echo soooooo much and would not trade it for anything in the world.
4131,11,"great electronic addition to the home. easy to set up and operate. looks great in the new fabric covering.this is our first echo so i can not rate the sound against earlier editions, but for our use, it sounds and works better than expected. i am looking forward to utilizing it more by setting up commands to operate lights, etc.definitely worth the money!"
4132,10,"hands down the best purchase i have ever made on amazon. amazing sound quality, quick setup, and overall really cool product."
4133,14,i love it just wish i could find more uses for it. the smart plug has proved to be difficult to install and so far we are unsuccessful.
4134,14,my kids talked me into getting this. i love it. listen to my spotify playlist all the time through it now.
4135,14,"good overall speaker, i would highly recommend for listening to music and ordering on amazon. echo did not know the answers to many simple questions that would be an easy google result with the home. echo listens better than the google home, as many times i have been a room over and without shouting, told echo to change songs and it did perfectly. 5 stars for quality, 3 stars due to the search reliability."
4136,14,"echo keeps turning itself off. i¡¯ve never had this issue before, keeps shutting off. is anyone else experiencing this? trying to troubleshoot before i send it back"
4137,10,"i love this speaker and alexa. i have placed this speaker in the kitchen and my family and i will play games on alexa while eating lunch. she cracks us up with the random questions we ask her. when i am cleaning, i can hear the music over my vaccum. very loud!"
4138,7,"love the endless possibilities. disappointed that it currently does not work with amazon music and the newer apple iphones. other than that, great product <f0><u+009f><u+0091><u+008d>"
4139,11,"really like the 2nd generation echo, and there is more bass on the new echo a love it."
4140,10,"i like the echo, it looks and feels good. and i like the sound as well. what i find interesting is that there were many complaints about this device. it made me not want it. i got it as a gift and i am glad i have it. this is a fun informative device that will keep getting better.  beam me up scottie!"
4141,10,"i purchased this as a christmas gift for my wife. she especially loves the music and is impressed how much sound comes from a small device. she is still in the process of learning all of the tasks that alexa can perform, but enjoys interacting with hear and teaching her to suit her personal needs.  this gift was a great success that keeps on giving."
4142,14,great but took a star off as set up was a pain. nothing hard just each step had to be repeated many times and was very frustrating.
4143,10,i find the device to be helpful for playing music on request and giving me daily weather reports.  it has excellent sound for its size.  the drawback is that it not very refined for answering simple questions such as the scores or schedule of many sports events.  i do not know is it is most common response.
4144,10,a great device and worth every penny.the music is wonderful and some of the features for automating your home.
4145,0,"did not know the echo listens and records everything it hears.  had i known that, i would not have purchased."
4146,14,"i was not really sure if i wanted this echo but after we received it, we love it. i also got a smart plug to finally start with some home automation. everything works flawless. the sound that comes from this echo is quite good and to be honest, it actually amazed me how elk music sounds coming from this speaker. alexa works fine even from across the room."
4147,9,we loved the echo so much we bought 2 dots to use in different rooms.  the echo set up easily (even for this 70 year old non-tech person).
4148,14,the echo is amazing.  it continues to amaze me with its ability to make my life that much easier.  i have had to buy other products because of it in making my house more compatible but it was time to upgrade them anyway.  i highly recommend this if you are a techy kind of person that enjoys the company of technology.
4149,10,"love my alexa.  as i continue to learn what she is capable of, i am amazed at how easy it is to use and helpful!who knew!"
4150,14,already had an echo dot.  i decided to get a larger one with a good speaker for my bedroom.  what i wanted.
4151,14,"i love my echo although she does struggle with adding to existing lists sometimes.  music on demand, list automatically on your phone, the list goes on."
4152,11,"i think the sound on the newest echo is a bit better, more bass anyway. excellent product."
4153,9,my son gave me the echo for christmas. i love it! the sound is great and the options are endless.
4154,10,i love my echo!  i use it daily for all sorts of things.  my children enjoy playing games on it.  i highly recommend!!
4155,14,"i like this device for my bedroom. sometimes when i a m playing the music loud, i have to yell alexa is name to get a response. but playing at a loud volume the sound is crisp and the speaker stays in place...very little vibration"
4156,9,absolutely love this.  we got it and hooked up our christmas tree light to it.  it made turning the tree on and off a breeze while we listened to christmas music.  i also connected it to my roomba vacuum.  i have been telling all of my friends about it.  i also gave away one to my daughter and her husband as a present.
4157,9,"love it, sounds very nice, carries throughout the house. will buy another for upstairs."
4158,10,alexa is a fun addition to our home. i like that it plays my music with a voice command. it was a little difficult to set up.
4159,9,"i loved the first gen, in fact i still am loving it but now i love this one even more"
4160,14,i did not give it 5 stars because it occasionally disconnects from my wifi and needs to be reset. i do not understand why this would happen since it is located a few feet from the router.
4161,12,alexa is awesome! still learning about all she is capable of. the sound is amazing and truly enjoying the musical capabilities.
4162,14,sounds is not great.  amazon should let you modified the levels so it can sound better in different rooms or situations.
4163,14,excellent. i hope in the future this item has spanish option. is like having a new and useful friend.
4164,10,"love it. great sound when playing music, kids enjoy asking questions, and works great for timers while potty training. when the toddler hears the chimes, he knows it is potty time. wifes wants a dot for the bedroom."
4165,11,"i love the looks of this, and it sounds just as good as my 1st gen, maybe better, can not really tell.  i do miss the thing you can spin on the top to adjust the volume...just buttons on this one."
4166,10,"love it. plays my, musci, answers my questions, tells, me jokes.  learning more about it all the time."
4167,9,we love our alexa!  the sound is great and alexa can even be funny.  very happy with this product.
4168,11,we have two first generation and one second generation it seems to us that the first generation is far better than the second generation. the second generation  is not as responsive as the first generation. we prefer the first generation and the dolby sounds the same as the first generation w/o dolby.
4169,14,so excited.  we are getting married...very small intimate reception.  only 30 people so we decided to use our echo as the dj.  so much fun gathering the songs.  can not wait to short some video!!!
4170,10,echo omg love this product sound is awesome listen daily to my allman brothers and weather report
4171,10,love my alexa - still figuring out its capabilities - appreciate the ability to play music so effortlessly.
4172,9,who does not love the echo.  i gave it as gift and it was received with a grateful heart!!!
4173,2,love my new echo!!
4174,0,i am happy with my echo. it has a great sound plus many features i am still learning.  i was a bit disappointed to find it has to be plugged in at all times.  i assumed it woud have a rechargeable battery as other comparable items.
4175,10,getting used to new technology. it works and sounds great. it is mostly used for music right now.
4176,10,present for my for my 76th birthday. i love the history lessons every morning. love it!  i feel kinda silly talking to a machine.
4177,4,sound is great for small device. setup was not easy as expected.
4178,10,really enjoy living with alexa.  she has no problem answering some of my stupid questions and she consoles me with the music i request with great sound quality.
4179,10,love it! use mostly for music and a few other things. sits in the kitchen and i like the timer skill.
4180,10,"excellent sound, allows us to listen to our favorite station hundreds of miles away."
4181,14,"i love it! i mostly use it to listen to music which is very helpful during showers because i do not have to get out of the shower and get my phone wet i simply just say ""alexa, play my ..."" or ""alexa, next song"". the only con is that my sister always changes the song."
4182,10,"this is a fun device, and i am becoming addicted.  and, like potato chips, it is impossible to have only one.  i quickly found i needed a second one for my bedside.  (how, after all, can i get out of bed without checking the time, the weather, and my calendar?).  i am still learning the things she can do for me, and i am having lots of fun with her."
4183,14,"amazing product. has great sound, might be more base to it vs 1st gen. connects easy and im still figuring out how to use it many perks"
4184,7,"love it, you can asked a lot of question to alexa and she answered it beautifully, i do not need to go up to turn on and off my light. <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+008a>"
4185,14,i guess it works as described. looks nice sounds nice just phrase question and orders correctly.
4186,14,"the sound quality is superb but it will be abused either by hackers (spectre and meltdown for example) or by someone like the nsa (if that is not the case already). my solution as of now is to simply unplug it, which does away with the convenience factor (hence 3 stars). whether or not there is a battery that defeats that modus operandi as yet i am unaware. but the sound quality is incredibly good."
4187,11,"this is my first echo, and i am very disappointed with the sound quality. my friend have 1st gen and it is sound much better. was advertised as better than 1st. was going to get sonos one but went with amazon (mistake). i am returning it."
4188,10,"i like how i can set an alarm, get news and weather reports. also i enjoy the parts that are more geared towards kids ¡°open the magic door¡± etc... really like the wood look as it works with my decor!"
4189,10,love listening to my music and the news. the sound is amazing and alexa is a good listener.
4190,11,"all the fun of alexa with a decent speaker. unless you need it really loud, this unit is very good."
4191,0,"it is okay. there are few very popular songs that i expected alexa would be able to play but can not, like hotel california by eagles."
4192,0,i like it can play music anytime i hate it come on when someone is says its name on the radio or tv
4193,14,"the future is here. great omni directional sound for music. incredible microphones (7).from listening to limitless music formats, to controlling the various electronics in your home. from anywhere with your alexa app.the applications are limitless."
4194,9,"i purchased a echo dot for myself, my daughter and my son for christmas...we love the echo and use it constantly...i keep mine exclusively in the family room but also wanted to have access to alexa in my bedroom...so i purchased this particular model...great investment for me..."
4195,10,i like the music that i can get alexa to play for me. i also like to get instant weather reports from alexa.
4196,14,i would like it better if i did not end up with a transcript of every connection on my ipad.
4197,11,i have a tap and 2 dots' - added the echo - works great- fills the room with sound- even better with the 3.5mm output.
4198,14,"i love alexa,  i can see a lot more improvements in the near future, i am hoping that in my lifetime she can clean my house lol!"
4199,10,"love having the ease of alexa at hand. plays my favorite music when ii  ask. we play games,  listen to news. and get answers to odd questions which is fun."
4200,0,"we certainly having a lot of fun with ""her"", but there are times she does not understand what was said to her.  her monotone can make things difficult for us to understand as well.  she could pause properly between words.  but overall, we love her."
4201,14,love this device. the base of questions you can ask continues to grow but it was enough for me just to ask time and temperature or occasionally a song i wanted to hear. it is a pain to have to use the awake work every time but this device is well worth it.
4202,10,"its a wonderful gadget, especially when i request it to play music from musicians, singers and bands i want to hear."
4203,10,"alexa is such a great addition to my home, my fiance and i love alexa. we use her every day multiple times, she tells us the ever-changing nc weather, notifies me of my package arrivals, the timers are awesome, my fiance and i can have different timers on at once, the speaker is great, it fills my whole apartment with lovely music. i highly recommend!"
4204,14,very affordable and usable. i hope it has a better iphone app that can control it from remote.
4205,11,"far better sound than my dot, although i would like to be able to adjust the bass and treble."
4206,5,bought this for my neighbor and oh golly she was blown away. she loves everything about it. i got it for a good price. super fast shipping.
4207,0,i like it but i thought it would be more like google search but it is not. it probably works a lot better if you have other things that you can control with alexa. but it is still fun to mess with.
4208,9,"excellent product which we are really enjoying. gave an additional one as a gift. excellent job, amazon !"
4209,11,"sound quality is amazing, set up was a cinch and since i bought the dot and echo together i have one in munich living room and one in my bedroom. jsb sounds amazing through the echo."
4210,10,"i love alexa, i talk to her a lot. my music is so easy to connect to and so many other 5hings."
4211,14,we have had this for about 2 months now and have really enjoyed it. it is extremely easy to use and family friendly. my 4 year old has mastered telling it to play kids music. i also like that you can disable to buying function.  the only downfall i have found is for some reason it will not pair to our bluetooth lights and it also will randomly turn off. i
4212,10,speaker sounds good.  love being able to ask questions and get answers.  my grand kids love alexia also.  still learning what all she does.
4213,9,"bought this as a gift for my parents, they love using it and having alexa answer their questions or play music from when they were first married. paired it with a dot for the bedroom, one of the better gifts they have recieved"
4214,9,works great. we disabled purchases cause we have young kids. but every thing pretty seamless
4215,10,this is great.  alexa plays great music from all genre is.  i like that there are games and she is an instant source of information.
4216,4,"yes i love it, very attractive and easy to set up and connect to your wireless network."
4217,4,i love catching npr. set up was easy with lots of bonus daily add-ons. lots of family laughter
4218,14,purchased for my mother-in-law who is in a nursing home and liked it so much i purchased one for myself.  this is a very versatile device.  mother-in-law can not manipulate the buttons on a radio or cd player and has difficulty with the tv remote.  she uses the echo to listen to music and catch up on the news.  i use it to answer quick questions when not near my computer or iphone.
4219,10,i am amazed what you can do with this item. i have fun in the mornings playing the various games.greet product
4220,1,this is a very nice sound device. the overall functionality is very impressive. i use smart home functions as well as the usual things.
4221,14,"this little but powerful device casts out a crisp/clear sound that stunningly surprised me.  the volume range is quite surprising and delivers a quality sound.  alexa is responses have been spot-on and can even understand the request coming from my 3 and 4 year old toddlers.  i did not give it a 5 star rating, only because i have not tested all of its capabilities, but so far it is been pretty amazing."
4222,11,do not sound as good as the original first generation units and do not get as loud either.
4223,14,"it is so hard  if you do not have excelent computer skills. i would like it to have alexa tell the hp printer to print my lists. the explanation i received  from the man in the chat room assumes your computer savvy and i am ok to do some things, but not.others. i could not make him understand. english would have been nice."
4224,3,sound could be a little better. it is  a great product  for the price. i thought alexa would be a little further along by now.
4225,10,"we just love this little gadget. at first we thought of it as only a little toy for amusement, but we are learning that it is much, much more than that. we now realize that it can indeed perform many useful tasks and as we learn how to use it it will only get better. we just added a ""dot"" so that we can take advantage of the intercom and linked music features..."
4226,0,i think the speaker works great in a hard to classic rock format..jazz is well balanced too
4227,14,echo is great. missed delivery for book for xmas. gave me option for 3 products for free that i would never use. 4th option apple ipad not available sold out? provided me a $1000 gift card from amazon but needed to sign up for a free vendors product with cc. looks like they sold my info to other vendors. still getting e-mails and calls from companies i never contacted. echo is goid product and fun!
4228,14,"we are just getting into echo, and so far we love it. will review further after we have it for a few months."
4229,14,i love that you can make a shopping list on here.  everyone can add what they need as soon as they remember that we are out of paper towels or detergent!  it is great!
4230,14,"i like everything about it. but to be honest i use it mostly to play music, as a timer, and as an alarm clock.  i shall venture further into features as i have time."
4231,14,the best from amazon.the speakers are out of this world. the best you can buy and bought it for offer price during christmas at 79.99$. now its 99.99$.
4232,0,"it has a hard time finding what i ask, particularity with songs. it can never find my local college sports scores. i have not found it usefully for more than weather and music. often times it tries to respond to the sound from my tv. the right volume for me is right between two settings, but that is not a huge issue. overall, pretty cool."
4233,11,"i own an echo dot, before getting a echo. it is a definite step up. it louder than the dot."
4234,9,absolutely love it!! not sure how i ever lived without it. already started ordering accessories! can not wait to smart proof the rest of my house!
4235,9,"bought it for my brother is family. have not heard yay or nay from them, but i like mine."
4236,12,love it....had some problems with the app.  but once we figured it out...all good.  very happy with the product and the speaker sounds great.
4237,0,"i have the google home and comparing this to that.. the echo is terrible. when asked certain questions.. the echo does not know how to answer it, whereas the google home always knows the answer to everything."
4238,11,much better than the original echo. the microphone is excellent and the bass stronger than before.
4239,14,only thing my wife (it was a christmas gift) does not like is that it has to be plugged in. she would prefer it to be easily moved from room to room. other than that she loves it and uses it all the time.
4240,14,works great with samsung smart things. sometimes alexa is a little hard of hearing and i have to repeat myself. i think it may be due to the tv volume being too loud. otherwise it is fine. that is way only four stars.
4241,14,i¡¯m trying to give this echo a chance before i send it back honestly. the first 2 weeks or so the echo understood me with no problems. now almost a month later this thing acts like it does not understand anything i¡¯m saying. i do not know about this one. maybe i need to exchange it and try again. kinda dissatisfied with the overall performance of the 2nd gen smh
4242,9,gift for my children - they love their echo- not sure what they did before alexa came to the house
4243,14,"it is working on my fire tablet but cannot have a conection with my internet. so alexa ie not talking to me........yet and amazon explanation did not help. if you can do better, i would love it"
4244,14,"overall this device is awesome! a little bummed that my music is limited without amazon music, especially since i already pay for prime. i  guess they had to make money somehow. my 7yo loves it, even called his grandfather on it while i was getting ready. lol i may have to disable the shopping feature before he breaks the bank <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0089>"
4245,10,the sound is outstanding. i ask it daily for a weather report. the music sound is outstanding.
4246,11,i like the 2nd generation a lot better than the first.  smaller and the fabric cover is nice.  sounds great too.
4247,14,purchased this to replace my original alexa and this one does not seem to hear as well
4248,14,randomly goes offline and i have to unplug and replug it. also the software recognizing that you are closest to it does not work properly. i can be standing right next to it and the dot across the house will determine that i am closest to that one. the routines are nice that way you can adjust it to the way you normally talk.
4249,14,"i like the music. i was not able to connect with bluetooth to my home entertainment system. i have a denon avr. amazon support was not willing to engage in trouble shooting the issue, even though echo and the denon receiver support the same bluetooth standard."
4250,11,shorter size is nice but i notice that it did not hear as well as my 1st generation alexa.
4251,0,"works great, i like the voice command aspect. all i have to do is say alexa play something and it does!"
4252,12,this is my first echo so the sound is pretty good to me.  still learning the different ways to utilize this device.
4253,1,the sound that comes out of this echo is amazing for such a small piece of technology!
4254,1,this thing is the best gadget ever. oh so much fun playing with it. works wonderfully. sounds fantastic. really good speakers. works all through my house. totally awesome
4255,14,"received this as a christmas gift. i would never have purchased one myself. i love the music i can listen to, other than that, it is useless for us. maybe if we had more smart home features? maybe i just am missing something?"
4256,0,"you can actually shut it off so it can not hear anything. it does not ""spy on you"". it can tell you jokes, it can play music, give you a weather report, turn lights on and off if you have a smart plug. it is a lot of fun!"
4257,9,"amazing sound for what it is.  my wife scoffed when i bought "" the gadget"". now she loves it."
4258,9,"echo was given to me as a christmas gift.  i love <u+2764><u+fe0f> everything about it.  my two granddaughters ages 3 yrs and 9 months love it.  i call alexa to play.  they look st the echo and wait for alexa to speak.  i ask for lullabies, they small and go to sleep."
4259,11,love this echo. i have the echo original and the dot. this one has a better sound by far. in a cuter smaller package.
4260,7,"love<u+2764><u+2764>.  easy to use, incredible sound. i opted to upgrade and pay for unlimited music.  really enjoy this.  plays sleep sounds, is an alarm clock, lets me know if planes are on time!"
4261,0,i love alexa... she plays great classic country music which i can not get on the radio.
4262,11,"performs as well as older models, do not care for -+ buttons in place of ring. audio good..."
4263,9,"we bought the dot first, we loved it. a week later we bought the echo as well. the kids used it to track santa and ask alexa to fart all the time lol. its pretty great and the audio(db) you get from it is pretty impressive."
4264,11,"my 5th echo device so far. love the look and size, not sure if it is much better than the original."
4265,14,"does not seem to connect to my echo dot quite like it should. also does not seem to work with my fire tv stick like it should, or my smart home devices... other than that it is a great product, awesome sound! with it being very inconsistent with my smart home appliances and other amazon products, it is basically a glorified bluetooth speaker at this point though. however good the sound is."
4266,11,"i have the echo and the dot, i definitely recommend the echo it has great sound much better than the dot!"
4267,14,"amazing.  sits in my kitchen and she does everything.  lowers my tv, changes music, tells me the weather for tomorrow!  then i move her into my bedroom to listen to soft jazz to relax.  you will not be disappointed"
4268,11,after buying the dot i ordered this in the walnut finish.  looks authentic and works great!
4269,10,great device. has been a big help doing all sorts of help in the home much more than i ever thought it do.
4270,7,"songs/music cuts off, holds and then continues for a minute or so then repeats cut off<f0><u+009f><u+00a4><u+00ac><f0><u+009f><u+0091><u+008a><f0><u+009f><u+008f><u+00be>i move unit to other rooms, move on the first room and the worthless so and so does the same thingobviously i¡¯m disappointed in my gift from my daughter that she purchased at bed ,bath, and beyond. the company has stretched my patience in amazon"
4271,10,"i purchased both the echo and the dot. both my wife and i really enjoy it! we used it during the holidays to play christmas music, check the weather, get sports results, and ask other assorted questions. both the echo and the dot are great additions your home. i will say the quality of the sound on the echo is far superior to that of the dot. still, i really enjoy both products."
4272,0,i wish your  could ask for traffic and directions better like the google smart speaker.
4273,0,"i love alexa, but i think she is needy.  she keeps talking without being called on.... did not she know it is rude to interrupt."
4274,11,"great sound quality, have two echos and a dot, although dot is good for lower volumes, the echo provides a superb base sound"
4275,0,"i am actually a bit disappointed in alexa.  i expect her to know more of have access to more information.  i find myself having to google most of what i ask her.  she is great with easy stuff, like weather, and playing music."
4276,10,works awesome. we use all the time. mainly just for music. love the hands free commands.
4277,12,"just got the 2nd generation alexa, love it!  still figuring out all it can do, so far would recommend!"
4278,14,i thought it was going to be a lot better then what it is. we should have rechargeable batteries but you have to keep it plugged into the wall seems kind of silly for this day and age.
4279,14,luv the echo. i purchased a tap 1st. decided on this for the bigger speaker. although changes in the app itself & not being able to request alexa play certain songs like i used to is a disappointment which is why o only have 4 stars
4280,11,"i love my 2nd generation echo and have it set up in our master bedroom. it is just the right size, the sound is better than my tap which i use in the family room."
4281,14,so far all it has been good for is playing music & reporting the weather! i bought it with the tp-link smart wi-fil plug. the plug took forever to setup with the wife-fil & there has not been a way to connect it to the echo! not a good buy!
4282,10,love it.  fun to use and especially great for listening to music .  love it for making a shopping list too.
4283,0,"too difficult to set up; but once set up properly, alexa answers most questions (skills) that have been downloaded."
4284,10,"it is wonderful, i enjoy the music especially.  the echo can play everything i have asked thus far,"
4285,2,i love the amazon echo. alexa is amazing. > i would recommend any of the amazon products like the echo
4286,11,really good speaker and very loud. must buy.
4287,14,"order this just 10 days ago, and now $20 less.  :("
4288,10,"i bought the echo to have music in my environment, but alexa does so much more! i am really enjoying alexa is company!"
4289,10,my grandson  got this for me for christmas. love it. there are a lot of things it does. finds music.works the tv.use the timer. .makes phone calls and does messages .and more
4290,10,"i love technology and echo! music is my favorite, but i do not need a calculator anymore!"
4291,1,love it and the sound fills the room
4292,11,"i first bought a dot about two years ago and really love it.  wanted enhanced sound so i bought an echo. disappointed in the way it sounds, too much bass and no way to adjust, which makes it hard for me to understand voice. listening to music is ok but only at higher volume settings."
4293,9,i sent this one as a gift. i have 2 of them and a dot. fantastically fun and amazingly entertaining.
4294,10,my whole family has one now and we will drop in and talk to each other from hours away makes it nice for grandparents when you can just start talking and they do not have to do anything.
4295,14,"sound quality and ""fun factor"" were excellent.  occasionally data is inaccurate."
4296,0,"love that you can ask alexa anything, get music, sports info, jokes. the 1st week it worked well, now alexa keeps saying 'i am having problems understanding you right now try again later'. that is really annoying especially when your asking her to play music you listen to on a daily basis. and then she can not process the command to shut off without being asked several times."
4297,9,love all our amazon echos. great sound and you just can not beat alexa.  she is so smart
4298,0,so much fun.  do not have to google anymore.  just ask alexa.  also like that it plays music with pretty good sound too.
4299,10,love learning about all the things it can do! convenient to add to my shopping list as i go about my routines.
4300,11,i love my second generation! great sound and is smaller than the first generation with more styles to choose from.  it will match any room.
4301,10,this was s christmas gift from my son and grandson. i liked the novelty of echo and i had fun asking different musical requests to see if the artists and songs were part of echo is data base.
4302,10,my son bought this for me for christmas i have downloaded a lot of my favorite music and i have also played a few games still learning all that it can do love it
4303,9,i love this echo and the sound quality is fantastic. now i want to trade in all of my echo dots in for a larger echo for every room.
4304,10,great toy!  could have been a lot easier to set up
4305,10,definitely met my expectations and more....easy to use and fun asking alexa questions.
4306,10,i am really happy with this gift i received.  am able to get a good variety of things i want with just the sound of my voice from anywhere.
4307,14,"i wish it could control the samsung smart tv, sony amp and cox tv box and dvr so i could control them all through with my voice."
4308,10,"this was a gift and i was not sure why i needed it. it is nice to be able to get music i like instantly just by asking for it or choosing a radio station i want to listen to, but many of the features will not be used - i do not want that much intrusiveness into my everyday life. the smart phone does too much of that already."
4309,9,never can go wrong with echo.  love this.  got this for my parents and they are loving it also!!
4310,11,works as advertised.  only problem was range of volume - cannot get it quite low enough.  sound quality much improved over original.would recommend it to a friend.
4311,10,i love the look & how easy it was to set up. it hands free so if i¡¯m cleanin just ask to play music. love it!
4312,11,this thing is a lot louder then expected and the sound is so rich and full it is amazing
4313,0,good sound though you have to repeat requests to alexa multiple times more than occasionaly.
4314,0,easy to hook up with the app. love the sound when  she plays music. most of the time answers my questions found the key is to ask them in a different way if she does not know.
4315,0,we love it.  plays any music we ask any time.  i even asked it when i was doing my crossword and she gave me the answer right away.
4316,12,totally enjoying alexa and using it daily. still learning the different applications.
4317,11,"good sound quality for the size, it has much more low end than the spot. can not go wrong."
4318,14,"must write a review because of all the haters. have never had an echo before and then purchased three of these in different colors. so far we have been extremely happy and feel like we¡¯ve been missing out on the echo and alexa world! the speaker sound  fantastic and we have them grouped together in the grouping feature works awesome! i think a lot of the negative reviews are from people who have owned the original echo and do not see much of a difference but do not let those negative review scare you away because these are great quality, great sound, and i¡¯ve already been a humongous convenience in our lives. we have them hooked to our nest thermostat and our harmony tv remote and both are working excellently.  i do not think it is fair that reviewer¡®s are giving this device such negative reviews soley because they do not think it is a big enough upgrade from the previous model. having nothing to compare this to i can say this is a very high-quality device that i now can not live without"
4319,14,it does not have the volume control ring on the top. it also could not find the only favorite radio channel i have on tunein. kept going to different one even when i kept telling it that it is wrong.
4320,9,"bought 2 for my kids.  now we all have one.  i love that i can use it as a intercom.  we all use it to ask questions, play trivia and listen to music"
4321,0,nice to be able to ask for something and its right there like a certain song or weather
4322,0,search engine is bing and it really can not help with many questions.  was hoping for less ¡®i do not know that¡¯ as an answer.  just not as expected - repeats the same answer even when you ask the question differently. even my 5 year old says ¡®alexa does not know a lot of things¡¯.  would be nice if it had a foreign language function to teach kids too.
4323,14,i got my first echo about a month ago and quickly added a second. the sound quality is fantastic. i am pleased with the amount of skills you can add as well. very happy i got this.
4324,9,i also got the wireless plugs with this purchase.  it was great to have alexa turn on and off the christmas lights this year!
4325,0,love what it does but would like something easy to understand to explain all its functions.
4326,10,the alexa is a very convenient device. we mainly use it to play music but my wife had expanded the use for reminders and shopping lists. it can also answer questions related to almost anything.
4327,0,"i wish that there was a way to control the bass and treble, for music it is fine, to listen to the news or a talk program it is difficult to understand  what is being said."
4328,14,"echo dot, echo and echo plus will only allow one of the echo is mentioned to play a song from our itunes library"
4329,14,i like this product. it does have some problems finding certain channels on my dish receiver.
4330,11,love the echo but wish it was wireless. the dots are cheaper than the portable battery so guess i¡¯ll buy one of those
4331,10,love it. great way to know ur daily calendar as ur getting breakfast before work. great for info and searches and music. great speakers
4332,9,we personally own two echos and purchased this one as a gift.  we love our echo and use it every day.
4333,9,"my wife said no.  now she is bonded with alexia after one short week.  fun, helpful."
4334,14,"it works well. it is mostly an expensive kitchen timer, but i also use it as a speaker. the sound quality is much better than the first. pairs easily with iphone, and has a solid connection. also, if you have prime, the library of music is surprisingly expansive. note that if you have prime through a household, you do not get all of the features."
4335,12,"it is our first 'alexa' - we love it, have not discovered all it can do but it is so easy to use.  great sound out of a small component."
4336,14,"i like it very much, i like to listening to the rain on a tin roof when i go to bed."
4337,14,"excellent functionality, pretty much as advertised. however (lol), it inserted itself into a discussion between spouses with an ""actually..."" comment that resulted in it getting tossed out of the room"
4338,1,"we love our alexa! :) was fun to mess with in the beginning, but we use it more for the sound quality. the bass is superb!"
4339,14,returned as it was intended as a gift as the recipient did not feel comfortable with the technology.
4340,11,the sound quality is far superior to the dot and it blends well with the furniture.  very nice!
4341,10,extremely impressed with alexia is knowledge and find the fee to listen to a more expanded music library is affordable. the sound is tremendous; i highly recommend it
4342,9,we never heard of amazon echo until our brother-in-law got it for christmas. we had to order one right away! we love it and so does our grandson who is three yrs old. he loves telling it what song to play. my dad is 94 yrs old and we are going to order him one too. needless to say it is great and the sound is exceptional!
4343,0,"i am still learning about my  alexas, something new almost every day.  love all the music i want to listen to but frustrated by having to word questions only a certain way in order to get a response.  what i love the most is not having to move alexa from room to room any more."
4344,14,ah its great when you want music but dont feel like messing with cd is or whatnot..
4345,14,"had the original, listened awesome. i¡¯m literally yelling alexa, this pos does not respond! wtf! this is an upgrade???? jeff bezos, put this in the garbage"
4346,9,"love this for the bedroom! it is my nature sounds at night, gentile alarm in the morning, music to start my day and turns off my nightstand light at night friend!"
4347,9,"love my echo - i use it for so many things, and has a great sound system for tune-in (also for music.)"
4348,10,"this device is awesome. great sound. fun to play games. keeps you up to date with news, favorite sport teams and weather. the smart house part is top notch, works with my neato smart vac and smart plugs can not wait to buy more. can not spell a word just ask alexa. this is a must buy."
4349,12,it has a wonderful sound and the reaction is very quick. so far i find nothing tht ii do not loike about it. it does a lot more than i know and i am blld you snet pointer into how to get more out of it.
4350,14,"this echo keeps kicking off my wifi and has to be reconnected.  does not happen with my other echo, so it is not my wifi.  disappointed!"
4351,14,"i did not like the change to the volume control. the ring was so easy to adjust the volume....  now i have to find the right button on top to adjust the sound. this was a step backward in usability. i did like the ""grouping"" i could do to sync the music from both of my echos. and i found it easy so far to add device for control, like light switches and the coffee pot."
4352,7,"just retrieved my new amazon echo from locker . i bought it for my wife is birthday. it is a  fantastic product. simply unbelievable. set up was soo easy. i am surely getting one for myself<f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0083>  long live amazon, the greatest company in the world...everything with amazon is simply amazing <f0><u+009f><u+0087><u+00ba><f0><u+009f><u+0087><u+00b8>"
4353,10,"alexa has been a great addition to my household.  she is managing my calendar and because i share my gmail account with my mom, all entries made by my alexa, my mom is alexa also knows.  has made managing appointments etc. so much easier.  alexa is also managing my hue lighting.  i smile every night when she replies to alexa, good night."
4354,11,i like the smaller size but you have to press buttons to change the volume. i like the 1st generation better where you can twist the top. also volume almost goes to nothing when you ask alexa something. i like the 1st generation better. still like the alexa system as a whole.
4355,12,"absolutely love my echo, so many features i have not figured out yet just freaking thing to do"
4356,11,alexa listens so much better than all the other speaker assistants. i love her.
4357,9,"love the echo. more than i even thought i would. after seeing ours at thanksgiving, my father ordered one too."
4358,10,"i am not a computer gadget person but at christmas my girlfriend and her 25 year old daughter came to the house and her daughter finally set it up for me.  it is really sweet.  i love the music, the sound is incredible and the jokes it tells and informative information everyday.  i also like the emails i get letting me know what else the echo can do.  so yes it was a gift and now i love it."
4359,11,amazing i have had a dot fir a while but wanted a better sound.  this one delivers great crisp sound fir music etc.
4360,11,speaker seems even better than the 1st gen i have in another part of my house.
4361,0,"we have really enjoyed our echo. it takes a little while to get use to the type of commands that you can give to alexa (what she can and cannot understand), but overall we have been happy with it."
4362,10,i have really been enjoying the echo. especially for reminders on time to leave for an appt.
4363,12,love it!  i still need to use it more.
4364,9,"loved my echo so much, i  bought 2!  great music sound, which was my primary want.  alexa is so pleasant!"
4365,14,i was not aware of all the things this can do simply by asking it to do.  the sound quality is pretty good for a small speaker.
4366,11,"love it, matches my decor and has much better sound then my dot (which i love also)."
4367,10,it is the greatest thing i put in my house i asked it almost anything and it is tells me everything it is greatit is the greatest thing i put in my house i ask it almost anything and it tells me everything it is great
4368,14,"if you are in the market for a ""personal assistant"" this is the device for you!we use it twice as much as we thought we would. add some smart home devices and it is a must have!"
4369,11,"they were right, the sound quality is sooo much more rich with this than the dot."
4370,0,have not used it to its full potential but so far am loving it. great sound quality and plays the kind of music i want by just asking.
4371,10,"love this for playing music, sound quality is great have not really played any of the games ."
4372,10,"the amazon echo is definitely what i expected it to be plus more! this ai is so handy for basically everything. you can make a grocery list, playlist, she plays different games with you.. this is the best gift i have bought for my husband!"
4373,14,i like it.  it is not perfect. needs better sound and better search capabilities.the music selection and access is perfect
4374,11,much improved sound when used with amazon prime music. nice look with grey fabric. i am glad i upgraded.
4375,14,i bought the echo for my wife who has limited mobility issues. she is doing all manner of things with the echo to keep her mind sharp. she has found more things than i have to use echo for. the sound is quite good and the unit generally performs as advertised.
4376,5,perfect size and color . bought this for my wife is birthday . she absolutely loves it .
4377,14,"first of all, i¡¯d like to say that the echoes make for great speakers as far as sound goes. the devices also have fairly receptive sensors for hearing the wake word from across a decent sized room.putting those positives aside, here were my issues: i was so excited to get my 2 echo devices because i find the ai technology very interesting however i found myself disappointed when the software turned out to be ¡°glitchy¡±. my favorite feature was initially being able to have alexa play my music or audiobooks to a set group that filled the whole apartment with music while i cleaned. this feature stopped working after having the echos for a couple weeks. even after resetting them and recreating the group, alexa would only play to the closest speaker as if not recognizing the trigger command/group name.additionally, the alexa ai would use the spanish alphabet to ¡°pronounce¡± my registered account name, even though it was set to english [u.s]. my name is jonda (english j) and alexa recognized it as honda. this occurred on both echo devices, so it is fair to assume that it was a software issue and not a hardware issue. (however i¡¯m no amazon software engineer). amazon customer service quickly traded out the devices when i reported the bug but the issue persisted (as again, i believe it was software vs. hardware related). i requested that a ticket be put into the engineering team, but am not sure if it ever made it to the development group. i ended up returning the replacement devices as well for a refund, commenting that the issue had persisted. i believe that had i been able to communicate the issue back to a developer or sme that it could have been resolved rather easily or we could have found a work-around.caveat: i¡¯ve since wondered if there is something in my amazon account that resulted in the software assuming i was of a spanish speaking background. i live in san diego, but am unsure if the software is smart enough to recognize that i¡¯m in a city with a high percentage of spanish speakers. (as in, maybe it was being too ¡°smart¡±?)i hate to use siri as a comparison...but i think a simple solution to this, and various other complaints i¡¯ve seen online about alexa is pronunciation of names that were not phonetic, would be to develop a similar feature to siri is solution. build in a ¡°alexa pronounce my name like____¡± feature."
4378,10,"i love it!  i received the echo as a gift and did not think i would use it but i have really enjoyed it.  i like the ""list"" option the best.  i tell echo what i need and from where and i always have my list on me.  no more forgetting or losing my grocery list. ;-)  jeopardy is fun too!  i am just learning what it can do but one of my favorite gifts!!"
4379,0,"i love being able to ask for a specific artist, song title, or album, and immediately the music starts.the technology still is not perfect (sometimes alexa will tell me ¡°i do not know what went wrong¡± when the music stops for no reason). and, sometimes the echo will turn on, and alexa will speak to me without me asking her anything!"
4380,12,"continuing to learn its potential, but happy with it!  great source for quick factual information, learning about the weather, hearing music, and much else!  very good sound quality!"
4381,14,<u+00a0>after a lot of hard work this works with echo. as they say look at what i can do. i hope you enjoy. you should see it dance to music.
4382,14,second echo in our house. ease of use and reliable responses are the main reason this is part of our home tech ecosystem.
4383,14,i am sure there is a lot more i can do but so far vary good companion as far as i am concerned sometimes echo will mess up but its not a big deal i hope the development of this product continues in it is own path.i use it to play music and set alarms witch i am sure i have only touched the sufuce of it is capabilities.
4384,9,"this thing is great, listening to all my old favorites with great sound.  bought more for christmas presents."
4385,14,"alexa is a great listener. her friend, the show, while pretty, does not seem to have the same attentiveness."
4386,10,"easy access to music, alarm, friendly.  did i just say that?  i use it for my grocery list."
4387,9,bought this for my husband is son. he loves it. plays games with alexa all day long and his her play music for him to sleep
4388,14,i got the 3 echo deal.  like a lot.  even ordered a refurbished dot.  would be 5 stars but the software needs work.  has trouble with playing all on a group. looking forward to improvements.
4389,9,love he color. like bieng able to use this and echo dots as an intercom system. speaker is so much better than the dot
4390,14,"amazon offered a good deal on the echo and the dot,i decided to try them out since i returned one a year ago that my son bought me. i am very impressed with this unit ,it is like having your own personal assistant. i¡¯m still adding and learning everything it can do. would definitely recommend it as a purchase."
4391,0,having trouble getting alexia to respondmaybe after i get the problem fixed i can respond with better stars
4392,14,"not quite there yet...  this is pretty cool, but seems to have hit the market under developed.  pretty cool, but you get bored of it quickly.  the only thing that most of the family enjoys is the link to amazon prime and spotify.  the music functionality is great and it sounds fantastic!"
4393,14,i like access to music best. have not found any negatives so far. love this thing.
4394,14,"although it is speaker is great, it does not connect to my bluetooth receiver and ceiling speakers."
4395,11,"sound is decent at best.  i put it in a 14x14 room and when turned up, it is distorted.  i would not recommend.  the echo plus is better."
4396,14,i absolutely love my echo. my only complaint is that it has to be plugged in at all times. i wish it was more mobile in that regard
4397,10,"my family and i are enjoying our echo, this is a fantastic device. setup was easy, and setting the skills in not bad. awesome!"
4398,5,i purchased this for my mother and it matched the fabric on her computer.  she loves it.
4399,11,"i love the speaker for what alexa can do mostly. as far as the sound goes, it is just ok. it distorts when the volume is maxed out. my bose soundlink color speaker is quite a bit better for sound."
4400,14,"i love it.  however... by itself it is a bit lackluster.  you will definately want to get additional items to go along with it, such as outlets.  now you have the beginning of home automation. as an example,  i tell mine 'bedtime' and it turns out the lights, confirms my alarm, and plays music."
4401,10,we are enjoying our echo very much! it has great sound quality and has been able to complete every task we have assigned it and answer every question. simply love it!!
4402,9,we love the echo and are planning to get one for my mother in law.  very easy to use.
4403,10,recently received this as a gift.  we have really enjoyed asking for the weather when we arise and listening to our favorite artists! we still have much to learn and appreciate.
4404,1,love it. works great with 2gig alarm and home automation system. recommended.
4405,9,got it for my wife for christmas. the whole family uses it. works awesome with amazon prime music.
4406,10,"love my echo. we use it for shopping lists, and timers. we love getting our news and weather as were getting ready in the morning. we use it as an in home intercom system, connecting with our dots."
4407,9,"we use our echo all the time! it is our speaker for music, our weather man, and our list maker! and it can do so much more."
4408,0,it was easy to setup and easy to use.but it takes some practice to know what how to ask alexa questions.
4409,11,i already had an echo dot and loved it but wanted better sound for music. this is great!
4410,10,"we are enjoying our new alexa.  it is so easy to ask ""her"" a question than go to the computer."
4411,10,awesome we love it! i can not believe i waited so long to purchase it. purached one for each house! my special needs son can even talk to alexa and she understands him!
4412,0,bought her to play music but then i remembered that i had google play music. she is still good to have around and ask random questions
4413,14,i personally need to understand the commands better. i enjoy the music and radio features.
4414,10,adore mine!  this thing makes creating a shopping list as easy as the spoken word.  it even will set reminders and wake you up in the morning.
4415,10,i love my alexa! she has so many incredible features and i have even set it up to where she can control the lights in my house. great product!
4416,10,listen in on everything you say..interupts you during movies without activation word
4417,10,we love it. we use it for most of our smart home devices and for staying up with news
4418,14,great quality sound and nice design.  the alexa service could be improved.  make sure it is competitive always with google.
4419,0,"i enjoy being able to ask alexa any question, from history to as simple  as tell me a joke. it is nice to have music played at a simple request without having to stop what i am doing . i could go on and on, i love it!"
4420,14,"i think it is the best thing since sliced bread. i have so many things controlled be alexa you cannot believe. my thermostat, all my lights, my garage door opener and the list goes on a lot of fun."
4421,11,"can not really tell the difference from the older model i own. it works great, no complaints."
4422,11,"excellent, but could use better mic volume. sometimes it can not hear me even when in the same room."
4423,10,so far this is so exciting...simply ask a question and she answers it...absolutely love it !
4424,14,"great sound, good response, and can be set up to control other home devices"
4425,10,"works great, and fun to have.  i had to call for assistance to hook up but they got me right on."
4426,11,"it works well, but i wish it had the sound quality of a jbl bluetooth speaker, or something of the like."
4427,9,we love our echo. great sound and quick response when asked a question. we bought the dot but returned it for this one.
4428,10,i really like the echo! alexa answers all kinds of questions. music has a nice sound. i am very pleased and would recommend it.
4429,11,"i had the echo dot and upgraded when this was on sale and i love it! the speakers have really good sound, i like the charcoal fabric and the ease of setting it up."
4430,10,excellent product and everyone has noticed the super sound quality!  we are so happy with this and i love having my pandora spa and relaxation music on during the day!  great purchase and worth every penny!
4431,11,sound fantastic coming from echo.  alexa does not know as much as i would have liked.
4432,11,"absolutely loved it, the sound system exceeded my expectations and the microphones on the top could here me even when the music was at full volume.  overall, absolutely love it."
4433,14,excellent responsiveness and really easy to setup and pair with other smart devices.sometimes alexa can be long winded
4434,11,i have 3. sound is really good for it is size. blends in well aesthetically
4435,9,"very happy with it! sound is better than the dot, so i am happy with it as my music source!"
4436,0,awesome! very simple and user-friendly the only downside is that it does not have spanish
4437,3,works well and sounds great - what is not to like??will it work in france??
4438,3,"bought as a gift but they love it. arrived on time, well packed, and works as it should."
4439,14,"alexa and i have become best friends.  the sound quality is more than adequate.  we had a new year is eve party and needed music in our two-car garage, the echo was a more than adequate sound system for the evening."
4440,9,this was a gift from my children - and they were right! it is awesome and i love it. sleep sounds are wonderful!
4441,14,i am using it in romania. that means that i have to speak in english (which is fine to me) and the range of services it is limited at this time. even so the speaker is fine (i listen a lot of music through internet radio stations) and i want to get used to alexa when new skills will be developed for the local market.
4442,9,loved it so much i bought them for my family and employees for christmas! also bought more for around the house.
4443,0,she does not know much. she is good for the weather. maybe if we get some other smart items. not too impressed
4444,10,"really enjoy its multiple uses, from streaming music to controlling the many smart devices in my home. it is made it easier for my kids to find what they want, and they are constantly asking alexa questions about life, science and more. i would definitely recommend getting one."
4445,14,i love this crazy thing. amazing the applications it can do. yes we purchase the pieces but it cost tells it all at the voice prompt. very cool. and i got the color i want to match my interior.
4446,0,alexa seems limited in it is ability to correctly do what i ask of it or plays something other than i asked it to. other times it can not find a popular song for me
4447,0,"really awesome sound quality. alexa does not seem to know the answers to a lot of questions, as long as you do not try to ask her to do something really complicated you will like this device."
4448,14,"keep it up with the great products amazon, things like this make the world different and feel so much simpler."
4449,11,i do not consider it an upgrade over the 1st gen but it does the same job.
4450,1,"a very, very nice gift.  i was very surprised at the quality of sound.  music sounds as if i have a surround home sound system.  very pleased"
4451,10,love it. my daughter uses it alot for music and jokes. good sound quality too.
4452,1,"the device does as advertised. decent commands, good speaker quality and works well with spotify."
4453,14,incredible. a true companion. i like the ¡°learning feature¡±. i hope the brains behind alexa and echo keep improving it. add some smart plugs and your abode becomes a house of the future.
4454,10,"love the interaction with news, information, and weather. plays my favorite music"
4455,10,i enjoy starting my day with alexa. getting an update of the news and weather for the day and listening to my favorite podcasts. i did find it a little more work getting it setup and making sure all the apps etc. were coordinating with the device. everyday i learn something else and am finding i rely on alexa to help keep me organized.
4456,1,love this purchase - so glad to have alexa added to the home! super fast shipping too!
4457,9,purchased this as a gift ---  it is loved by everyone in the household!  thank you.
4458,4,great sound quality and easy to use.  difficult to setup and connect to wifi if your using a mobile wifi hotspot.
4459,10,"we love having our echo.  it is very entertaining and  handy for weather updates, telling jokes, playing music, and so much more."
4460,14,as much as i like having this i disliked amazon.  the prices dropped by $15 a couple of days after i bought it and was told amazon does not match prices.  if i had know this i would have bought the google home
4461,14,the 1st generation version sounded crisper. there is no ability to control bass. it is so deep that you cannot understand podcasts or news reports. very disappointed.
4462,12,easy and fun to use. we like trying to trick it and see what type of responses we get. nothing to dislike so far!
4463,14,"i think it should be able to better understand short hand conversation like ""get the lights"" instead of ""turn off the living room lights"" but i am very pleased with the product.  also with amazon music you should be able to add individual songs to your playlist simply by saying ""add this to my playlist"" instead of having to go through the app."
4464,14,"really starting to hate the echo 2. had several echo dots. wanted to upgrade at least one of them to something with a bit more power and sound quality and use it in the kitchen. what does one get? a smart speaker that is way too bass heavy / completely unbalanced and a failure as a bluetooth streaming speaker. when streaming the spectrum tv app, the sound is very staticky and cuts out every few seconds. the ipad mini streams the audio or video program just fine on 5 ghz. relay the sound to the echo 2, static, audio drops, ... make it intolerable to listen to any program, from news to documentary, game show, ... no matter if they sit 1 - 2 - 10 feet apart. never a complete audio signal for more than a few seconds. really need amz customer service and engineers to pull through on sound balance in the next few weeks, or this is going back to amz."
4465,14,"we are greatly enjoying our echo 2. the sound is clear, volume control great and she understands what we ask, unlike the gps in our new chevy truck."
4466,14,it is pretty limited the info you can get. unfortunately our samsung tv happens to be from the year that is not compatible so we can not even work that
4467,10,love being able to listen to the music i want to.  i wish the tone was better
4468,9,it works like a charm. enjoying the music so long as your a prime member.
4469,9,the most is the quick respose and sound. the least i bought it for 99 went on sale for 69
4470,11,this is a great device. though i did not have the 1st gen. i think this has great sound and responds well. it is also a good size and i like that i can switch the skin on it is i want to.
4471,14,i¡¯m am enjoying the enhanced speaker capability and the ease of connecting other echo dots throughout my home. i¡¯m very satisfied with my purchase and am considering another echo dot to connect for added coverage.
4472,14,"very please with this product.  having fun with it and it is useful.  i use the shopping list and timer.  the only thing is it does not have user is manual.  i am sure i would use it more, if i know what all it could do.  i like to review user is manuals with all products i purchase.  i mentioned this to others who have also purchased one and they have the same comment."
4473,9,"a gift for my 90 year old mother, and she loves it. she asks it to play all her old music favorites from the 40 is."
4474,1,"it is an excellent product, the voice of alexa and all the functions that it has are incredible, the sound is spectacular, i recommend it totally."
4475,14,nice to be able to make lists on the fly or ask a question without having to find your phone or log into your computer as well as listen to music work great stereo sound
4476,0,"fun for asking questions, but when it comes to sound, very poor quality. to really be able to use it in a room where you need good sound you will need to play it through a better sound system!"
4477,5,i gave mine as a great christmass gift for my brother house they love it thanks so much
4478,0,love it but have not figured out how to make it work on much. would like better instructions .
4479,14,"if you have children or kids visiting and you¡¯re old, you need this!! i love that it reads my books online to me also. what fun it has been to dance with my great niece (20 months) to polka music, ricky martin and twinkle twinkle little star!!"
4480,3,works great we love it it is fun to mess around with thank you very much for creating it
4481,0,"does not do but trivial things. good for weather an to play music, but only plays music if hooked to an app."
4482,9,"exactly as advertised, works great! these are a blast, everyone in the home loves it."
4483,14,"love, love, love this!  we just discovered we can connect it to our dish network and control the shows/tv.  my kids love playing 20 questions with it also."
4484,14,"it was a gift, however i have heard it working on one occasion and it has amazing sound."
4485,0,still learning to use it and remember that i have it.  it was a gift and i did not even know these exisited.
4486,5,i got this for my son for christmas and he absolutely loves it! works perfectly and quick shipping as well.
4487,0,the wife and i enjoy this device very much.  it is able to respond correctly to the majority of our request.
4488,14,i enjoy this echo. it is still not as powerful as my bose but i love it and all the other conveniences
4489,14,"love the echo!! i love playing my music loud and for a small object, the echo packs a mean sound.i plan on getting additional echos for my home."
4490,10,"it was a christmas gift and i¡¯m loving it. love being able to just ask alexa to perform certain skills,etc.  and just being voice activated is great rather than having to google everything for answers, i just ask alexa!!!!"
4491,10,i love my echo. i love that it will do audible with my kindle books and the music is great. i just love everything about it.
4492,14,"works intermittently.  we can only get it to play music (via any source) about 20% of the time.  i¡¯ve spent too much time with tech support with no resolution.  we have high spes and have gone as far as sitting next to the router.  very disappointed.  all other functions seem to work fine, but music was the main reason we purchased this unit.  i would not recommend."
4493,14,"great sound. does not know much about football, easy linking to other devices. sometimes loses wireless connection to 5 ghz so am using 2.4 ghz connection. pretty good otherwise."
4494,10,so much fun! great for playing music. i also use it to make grocery lists and to answer random questions. my husband got this as a present for me and i did not think i needed it and now i can not believe there was a time before we had this!!
4495,10,we bought it mostly for the music but getting used to all the other extras too. so fun!
4496,10,"we mainly wanted the echo to listen to music, mainly christian music. but we do also like to listen to 1950 is & 1960 is & 1970 is as well. it was a little confusing to us on how to set it up via the internet on our lap top but our son was able to help us. we still have to set it up for phone calling, but my wife loves it . it was her christmas gift ."
4497,11,sound is much better than first gen.  mics are also more sensitive.  i own 5 and they are fantastic.
4498,5,purchase as a gift for mmy son and he loves it.  great quality and sound for a great price.
4499,11,the sound from this echo is muffled and is not as clear as the previous generations.
4500,10,love my alexa!  a really great product and easy setup for those that are not tech savvy.
4501,14,i am only giving 4 stars because amazon really needs to thinks of a way to make this completely portable. it works amazing however it does have to stay pulled in order to work.
4502,14,what can i say?  i like alexa. i am very glad i finally acquired an echo.
4503,0,i am over the hills in love with my new amazon echo and so far there is only a few things it did not know the answer to and that upsets me there is a song that was popular for many months by reba mcentire angels lullaby and it has no idea what it is no matter what i ask for to be downloaded no matter what i ask it to do it does not know the answer.
4504,10,this is the best device ever. i love it because it plays most music that i love.
4505,14,"we thought it would be interesting, and nice to provide some music. however, very few of the pieces we requested were available. there was limited jazz, and the only classical pieces i could get were a ""readers digest"" version of the main melody.  it told us that a trial subscription to amazon music might provide better results so we did that.  the same results.  it is great for our grandchildren, and played all their requests, but is certainly not for our generation!  moving on to requests for information on cooking, geography, etc. resulted in most often having no information.  finally packed it up and returned it! just hope we do not get billed for amazon music..."
4506,11,"pros: smaller design and purchase pricecons: sound quality, alexa responsivenessoverall: i¡¯m not sure i can say the sound quality is much better than the 1st generation. i like the small design and unit more structures. the wake feature for alexa does not seem to be responsive and does not wake up clearly. the quality of the 2nd generation does not seem improved."
4507,11,"i had one echo already, this is smaller and works great and sounds good"
4508,9,"happy with our new echo, with the exception of amazon music.  long after christmas was over, alexa was playing christmas music.  the speakers are great and we¡¯d recommend this product to anyone."
4509,0,what i like most that it has a clear recognition of the human voice.  what i liked the leas was that alexa is nothing like google and does not really answer question or it always said sorry i do not know that ..
4510,10,the sound is great and all the things you can do with it !! love this thing...kinda addictive  and our thermostat work with it!!
4511,14,overall the echo and dot are welcomed addititions to our home. although i was a bit suprised that texting capability with family members is only currently supports android phones. hopefully the developers resolve this limitation.
4512,14,"echo is seriously badass in all aspects but with being from texas she does not always recognise what i am saying even if i clear up my texan draw. other than that, it is awesome!! do wish i did not have to keep it plugged in constantly, portability would be much preferred but with the enhanced speaker i can hear it from every corner of my house."
4513,0,love alexa! the kids do too... especially for math problems they do not know
4514,12,"i love my echo.  when i play music with it, it sounds great!  i am still learning all the things that alexa can do."
4515,9,bought this for someone as a christmas gift. totally jealous because i have the original and it is much bigger!
4516,10,best experience ever!the amount of music we hear all day long from amazon library is amassing.we are very happy with it and the sound is amazing with every song it plays.
4517,11,"gift, but sounds and looks good.  at least as good as it is predecessor."
4518,14,"the echo was amazingly easy to set up, has fantastic voice recognition and good sound for playing music as well.  i had anticipated devoting a good portion of the day to getting it up and running and it was working in under 15 minutes."
4519,14,"i have a dot too. i had the echo in the bedroom for all night play. the bass is to loud  and mushy compared to the rest of the music. i swapped and now ok with dot at night.  from 93 yr old guy,now a widower. when wife was alive i had to use ear phones.it is a good product and do enjoy being able to tell alexa to change volumn. wish the + or - signs were more visable."
4520,14,"pretty simple device without much purpose it seems, unless you need to know the weather or the time..."
4521,8,"awesome!  just awesome! i love my alexa. wow. great sound, no complaints. love it!"
4522,14,"i am enjoying this!  a surprise gift, alexa is always at the ready to answer questions, play various genres of music, and many more treasures still to be discovered.  setup was easy and there have been no hiccups.  there was this one time she spoke up without having been prompted, but do not we all speak up occasionally?  i recommend!"
4523,10,it plays my music beautifully!  it will hive me the weather.  she is very smart.  she is fun
4524,5,purchased as a gift for my daughter at christmas. she loves her alexa!
4525,0,"it was a bit difficult setting up to use. ....and it scares me.  i keep it turned off most of the time.  i feel like it is listening and recording everything.  i have also seen the ones that ""laugh"" for no reason at all.  i am just not sure how secure my privacy is with this thing in my home."
4526,14,it is does everythinges as intended mic sound pick up needs a bit more of an improvement and would have given it 5 stars if they would make a app with diffrent alarm sounds current alarm is to soft. and clock radio is buggy still
4527,0,the sound is very high quality and easy to use if you have the alexa app free for downloading from the playstore
4528,14,"great product, love it, plus i get amazon music unlimited for 3.99 month! sound very nice through my tv sound bar!"
4529,10,"it is been interesting learning how to use alexa. i did not realize that i had to open skills. i thought she had all the information open and ready to go. once i opened some skills it is been fun. i love the music, weather and news. i am learning and soon i will order some of my amazon shopping through the echo."
4530,14,"alexa...make me dinner!""cooking is beyond me.""at least she is honest :)"
4531,1,absolutely superb that works very well and goes really well with my decor..
4532,14,"alexa is a great life companion. after years of being single there is no need to start dating now thanks to this device! from playing sad love songs, to telling jokes, and rarely telling me no, i am truly on cloud nine. the only thing that could make this better would be having a male voice option, preferably with an australian accent. maybe some day. until then, thank you amazon!"
4533,0,"dislikesdevice has to be plugged in at all times in order to workyou will need more than one for a 1,000sqft housebeginning set up is very diffecultlikesgreat for small apartments/ homesstylish colorsgreat alexa responsei am really basing the 3 star off the fact that this device is not mobile, otherwise it would be a 5 star."
4534,14,"i love my echo! easy to set up and i have not had any issues with it whatsoever. only down side is having to keep it plugged in all the time. going to purchase the dot soon, so i do not have to move my echo around the house so much."
4535,9,i gave this to my youngest sister and hopefully it will lightened up her apt.
4536,10,"love our echo! nice to have for games, news, weather etc. still plenty for us to learn"
4537,14,"i like my system - right now i am having issues with my internet provider,"
4538,3,this was a great buy i love the new sounds awesome i would buy again i would recommend it.
4539,0,playing songs works better at different times meaning sometimes fast and efficient and other times slower and says it cannot find song request that in previous times played  seems to happen during busier internet when it is working very pleased.
4540,10,"easy to set up and use. we use her a lot for weather, traffic and some day to day things. excited to explore more and really utilize!!"
4541,14,"like being on the front end of 'beneficial artificial intelligence"" with the wide bandwidth of capability...ease of use...quality of sound.it was liberating to abandon ipod, spotify, and all the clicking required.(minor critique...wish the sound level went higher than 10...easily resolved by channeling alexa through my bose docking device)"
4542,10,boy did we get addicted to all the things echo can do.  one of our favorite functions is setting multiple timers. i also depend on it when doing measurement conversions for baking! buy this thing and really get to know what it can do!  totally worth it.
4543,1,for a 100 bucks it is a pretty cool device. it is a fun device and works really well.
4544,14,"not sure why, but it can not calibrate correctly. i¡¯ve tried over two times and it always thinks i¡¯m talking from a different direction, so it does not pick up my voice. i have the dog in my bedroom and it works like a charm. since i have been setting up my house to be a smart house, this is kind of disappointing."
4545,9,"i love the device!!!! no problems with set up or anything, i wish i would have ordered one sooner."
4546,0,we really like this!  it does not know as much as google though!! lol!
4547,14,have not used this yet but i have numerous other echo products and they are all great!!
4548,9,"got this for a gift for my husband!  well i¡¯m using it more than he is! music is great to listen to. so many things you can ask alexa, it is fun!<f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+008a>"
4549,10,kids love the echo. sounds great and can listen to all kinds of music with amazon unlimited
4550,9,i now have 1 echo and 3 dots throughout my house! i play music in every room and just love it!
4551,9,arrived well packages and easy to set up.  answers questions and controls different components in my home.
4552,14,we have been playing around with alexa all weekend!!  she is awesome!!!
4553,9,wish i had bought two. my wife loves it. i love it. paired with amazon music. does not get much better. wish i had another.
4554,14,totally annoying! seems to play the worst or most obscure selections from any artist. if it can even find the artist or station requested. full sound but way too much bass.
4555,14,"loved the ability to bring up any song,  from any composer  without having to go hunting thru my cd is..lol"
4556,14,"very impressed with alexa! the only thing i dislike about her is that she has to be connected to an outlet at all times to work. other than that, would highly recommend if you are considering buying for yourself or as a gift!"
4557,11,much better sound that the first gen echo at almost half the size. also cheaper than the first gen.
4558,0,most: it is easy to use. least: it does not know as much as i had hoped
4559,14,"had the tap and sent it back after 2 days.  i kept having to reset it every time we would not use it for a couple of hours.  this one has been great.  awesome sound and it love the shopping list feature.  helps with time.only con is that it has a hard time understanding spanish, but it is good otherwise"
4560,11,"speakers are much, much better than the previous echo.  seems to respond better to my commands."
4561,9,i received the echo as a gift and was not sure quite what to make of it.  now i love it!  the sound is amazingly clear and the quality is great. there are too many features to list and i am learning new things about it every day.
4562,14,the sound is great. the design is beautiful. the voice recognition still just ok. some of the phone based alexa controls and setting are still poorly designed.
4563,1,"works great, wife loves it. sound is good considering how small it is."
4564,14,omg! the difference between the echo dot and the echo is night and day. the sound is much better and louder! so glad that we got this one. we love to listen to songs on a saturday afternoon and go down memory lane. so great and it will never disappoint you! make that choice today! you will not regret it!
4565,14,i routinely brow-beat and verbally abuse alexa. she just stands there....
4566,14,i am still waiting for it to update fully otherwise it is a welcome addition to our home.
4567,14,we love it so much we got our daughters one. it is so nice to just to drop in instead of using our phones that way we can cook and talk to them.  also i got my husband one for the garage that way i drop in and tell him supper is ready. least is it cuts out sometimes but i was told it could be our wifi
4568,10,"wow....alexa is super cool.  i can ask her anything and she will go out and surf the web and answer me logically and pleasantly.  even when our home is empty except for me, she keeps me company.  i love that she can play so much music with high quality."
4569,14,"sound quality is amazing!! there is just not much alexa can not do or answer! love it,would buy all over again,and have definitely recommended to many people!!"
4570,14,i have been  waiting  a long  time for a device  like this! love the fact i can walk into  a room & hear  whatever i want. i only wish the  music library was larger to include songs that  may  not  have  made the  top 40. overall it ia wonderful device.
4571,5,"so far, so awesome! i bought this as a gift for my husband. he loves it, and that is what matters to me."
4572,11,"i love being able to do something hands free and have a responsive ai assistant at home. plus, this new rendition is beautiful-- matches my kitchen so nicely and has great sound quality!"
4573,11,i really like the echo the sound is great for listening and i bough my in grey so it looks nice in my kitchen. it is small enough that it fits perfect on the counter and is not in the way. the echo is way better sound wise than the dot is.  i have no cons as i mostly use this to play music.
4574,3,this echo is amazing!!  do not know why i waited so long to get one!!
4575,0,i find it interesting how certain things she knows but yet other times she does not have an answer. i am not sure i am using her to the fullest advantage.
4576,9,daughter in law is having fun with it . she a tech person so i think it was expected
4577,14,"for the most part, i am still looking for ways to make it more useful than an additional speaker for music. i am at my computer most of the day working, so it is faster for me to look something up on my browser and review my options rather than ask alexa. but it works well as a conversation piece."
4578,14,many different options you can add into the echo. i would like to see more direct collaborations with companies or tech developers and not so many third party 'apps' that can be added. the flash briefing needs a skip option and repeat option.
4579,14,"what i like most about eco is it hears me over loud noise. it can take commands under any level of noise. what i like least is its not personal. . anyone can give eco a command to review my reminders, list, and anything else. i have had it a short time, but i can tell there will be safety issues unless there is a way to privatize it. i am still learning the product"
4580,9,"i have the echo plus, which we love.  bought this for my daughter and she loves it. great sound."
4581,14,nice product decent sound bought 2 for 120$. also use it to turn lights off and on
4582,0,i only give it 4 stars because there just is not a ton you can do with it. i will say the speaker is really nice and gives loud great sound.
4583,10,"very impressed so far.  great looking, great sound.  i love having my music available with just a voice command.  i plan on buying more.  hoping to also purchase some smart items for our home."
4584,14,"no, i have the original echo and works way better then this one and we continue to have issues with with it. will play music randomly, and will continue playing music after you tell it to stop"
4585,11,"echo 2nd gen has great sound but most important is that it has a great looks. echo has a fabulous texture and color; is never obtrusive in any room, be it formal or ultra casual, 18th century formal or cowboy chic."
4586,14,"love love love it <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+008d> the sound is awesome and it is so responsive!! we tried the google mini, but it would not stay connected to our wifi.  we have had 0 issues with the echo. i would totally recommend it to anyone."
4587,9,got it as a gift and she loves it. the sound is great and the look is comfortable.
4588,9,our daughter got it for us old folks for christmas and yes we love it  thank you tee
4589,9,gift for one of my grandsons ! we all love it so much ! i¡¯m going to order one for our house too!
4590,10,"i really love my echo.  i can ask questions, & listen to my radio stations hands free..  i use it as a timer too & can stop it to take a phone call but do not have to be in the same room."
4591,10,needless to say the kids are having so much fun with this device.  i myself have used it to find my phone in the house when i misplace it.... which happens daily.  i also have used it to play pandora and as a timer and alarm clock.  i am still working on its many uses.  probably the most interesting christmas gift i have ever received and yes i am happy with it.
4592,0,looks good. have not installed it yet but will follow up when i do.
4593,0,"i like it a lot.  i had trouble at first because i kept calling it alexis instead of alexa.  could not figure out why she would not answer.  i do not use it a lot, but it is quite nice."
4594,11,amazing what this unit can do.  the cheaper dot works just as well.
4595,9,we absolutely love the echoes. we have 3 and thinking about a few more.
4596,11,it sounds better than my echo plus with more bass. it does however go on a tangent at times with using the call name echo instead of alexa. but i still enjoy the rich quality sound.
4597,14,"so spectacular.  do yourself a favor and ask her to talk dirty to you and see what she says, lol.  whoever designed her, had a sense of purpose and humor.  we will done."
4598,12,very fun.  learning everyday about the ways to use it.  feel like such a techy.
4599,9,the gift was for me but my husband loves to boss her around. poor alexia. it is the first electronic device he has ever used. he loves it.
4600,11,"it works well, but he audio quality is not as good as the first generation."
4601,9,"this is my first echo...and wow, so glad i purchased this. the sound is amazing. i also got the echo dot, but have to say the echo with adobe sound is unreal!  worth every penny.  highly recommend!"
4602,14,i like the original better...and i do not like the fact that u have to pay to download music and such..and it talks and laughs when no one is near it
4603,14,amazing! just why is not mexico include on the countries list? . this makes difficult for some features to work . like i cannot use skills for kids such as ¡°animal sounds¡± etc because the restriccion with ccv number. other than that is a wonderful gadget . very happy!
4604,9,"love, love, love, this product. the music sound is perfect. we have 3 now."
4605,10,"my husband and i loved it so much we got the dots and now have a ""smart"" home. there are so many skills in this thing. ones with a purpose and ones for fun. my oldest kiddo loves magic door and animal workout. i set a routine for each morning to start my day with the weather and a devotional. still discovering more of what it does and it is always improving."
4606,9,very cool item. as a tech junkie i got the echo 2 as a christmas gift. i use it pretty often
4607,14,"4th echo, love it. but they are starting to laugh out of no were, little creepy."
4608,10,"it was a gift, and it is been so nice to have. i listen to the news and stream music in my kitchen."
4609,9,"wonderful!  we were given an echo dot as a present <u+200b>and liked it so much we purchased an echo 2nd generation.  we never thought that we would like such a device, but we absolutely love it!"
4610,9,"we have three alexa is , and this has the best sound of all of them.  very impressed!"
4611,10,we got echo as a gift.  can not stop asking her the time.  lol  plays all my music.  my husband can not remember her name.  it is just like in the snl skit where the elderly calls her by many different names and she answers to them all.  it is so much fun.  feels likewe we are living in the future.
4612,11,i love my echo.  i also have an echo dot.  i really enjoy both but the sound from the larger echo is noticeably better. both have great functionality. i am so glad i got them.
4613,0,would like to change hear name?she doing a fantastic job. i am really excited about this echo
4614,0,great sound quality and very impressive voice recognition! has turned on if it hears the name alex or alexa from a commercial
4615,9,"can not go wrong with one of these! i<u+fe0f> have purchase this for myself, as well as my brother and parents!"
4616,10,this little rascal exceeded all of my expectations. it is a great device and a great companion for the elderly. i am 89 years old and my wife and i really get a kick out of it.
4617,11,this is a great addition for anyone looking to learn about smart devices and start small. the sound is pretty good for an apartment sized area. would definitely recommend
4618,12,love it
4619,10,i live alone and it keeps me company with great music. love all the comments from alixa
4620,14,was so exited to get this and it would not even turn on. called customer service and they were unable to help.
4621,14,"performs as advertised, with a little googling and tweaking.  the sound quality of the speaker was much better than i expected, and the number and variety of the skills you can enable is mind boggling; fun to mess with. oh yes, the drop-in feature is very handy, both within the house and from home to office."
4622,10,my grandkids are always asking alexa questions and i enjoy her daily fun fact.  we¡¯re still working with her and really do not know everything she can do.
4623,0,"it looks very nice,  however it does not really work for my needs.  i have a business,  i was looking for continual music of a particular genre.  it will not just play one genre. it stops andi have to continually restart it. and it says it can not find the genrei asked for half the time,  even though it was just playing that... not pleased at all."
4624,0,i really have not had much time to get it set up for the way i want to use it. i like the fact that the line out is stereo and it has bluetooth connectivity. i am sure i will enjoy it.......
4625,11,"the sound is considerably better than the first gen. the bass is loud and deep. alexa is my best friend. everything i ask her, she does. i recommend this device to everyone."
4626,9,"i can talk to it from my chair, i am disabled, listen to pandora music almost all day, really enjoy the quality of the product, great speakers. my son put a small one in my bedroom if i wake in the night and want to ear music in the night. love it. thanks for your wonderful product......"".  hq"
4627,9,bought this for my parents who are older. it works great for them to call me or drop in on my echo device
4628,1,i absolutely love it. has great sound for my music. i like the design of it very much.
4629,14,the only issue i have is that once you get an echo you want to update all the stuff in your house so that you can use echo for more stuff!
4630,9,i purchased this for a christmas gift because i have the generation 1 echo.this is a perfect gift!love my echo!
4631,14,"i love alexa, it is constantly learning new skills and fun to use. the speakers may be improved but they are still a long way from great audio quality. i guess if i really wanted that i could have paid a lot more for the sonos one with alexa. all in all i really enjoy my echo and am considering getting others for different rooms of the house."
4632,10,the sound is pretty amazing for the size.  i can even pick up radio stations i normally can not receive on my other system.  love it! ;-)
4633,10,"how does one live without alexa?  did not know how much i needed her until i had her... start the day with weather, jokes, and my fav tunes to kick start the day.  and that is just the start...."
4634,1,great item!  this device is compatible with a lot of automated equipment
4635,0,"does not quite know everything, but i do like when it does answer."
4636,9,sounds great. echos ate good for music only. this works great for music.
4637,14,it is an amazing product. now purchasing another one for my sisters birthday.  delivered before the end of the week. way to go amazon.
4638,12,"we are enjoying this at our house, but i do not think we have yet tapped into the full capability."
4639,9,my entire family loves this item. i have paired it with may smart home devices!
4640,5,this was a gift and it is wonderful to use.
4641,14,i am a dj by trade and i am amazed at how good this sounds in such a small package.
4642,10,love getting the weather at anytime.the music sounds really good!it is like having a friend around all the time!
4643,0,enjoy asking trivial questions and general informative questions. disappointed that so much of the music may be samples only.
4644,0,amazon echo is entertaining and so enjoyable especially the three questions. you can gain quit a bit of educational information by asking alexis questions. what i truly do not like is when alexis repeated a question i have already answered and she already gave me the answer. she will ask a question then give me the the answer to the question before that one.
4645,10,"i love the echo.....""alexa"" plays my favorite music, tells me the weather foe the day, and the days i am feeling blah, ""alexa"" has the most funniest jokes to share."
4646,11,works same as original but does not have capability to turn up on the unit. love the gray!
4647,11,"love my alexa, the sound quality exceeds what i was hoping for. great purchase!"
4648,4,great sound quality!  easy to set up other devices that work with alexa.
4649,9,"sound is fantastic, very responsive, i have one at my office and the other at home."
4650,14,i love this but wished both the echos i have could sync hand play music together.
4651,14,alexa ana quite quickly.  however she breaks up now then like there is a conflict somewhere.
4652,9,"had issues setting it up, but our 23 year old son got her working great, we love it!"
4653,3,"i love it! it was a lot easier to setup than i thought it would be,  and the sound is great!"
4654,14,i am waiting for the spanish language and a google feature (looking for something in google). but amazing sound and use!
4655,11,quality of sound is much better and it can hear you over it is sound.  appearance is also better.
4656,9,"i love it! i have one on the living room, one in a back bedroom, and an echo dot in my study."
4657,10,most... love the stories she tells everyday when we say 'good morning'... the least: have not found anything yet.. :)
4658,0,love it so far!! sounds great and she can hear me rather well compared to my phone.
4659,14,"sound quality is really nice. love it, easy to use, we have several dots as well, and the sound from this echo is leaps and bounds above those."
4660,10,"absolutely fantastic device. plans for buying another for the living room. use it for playing all my amazon prime music and for the many game, sleep sounds and for weather and news updates that come with the alexia app for this echo device."
4661,14,this is nothing but wonderful goodness!  love the built in hub and improved sound quality.
4662,14,"the sound quality/difference with the 1st g is not too noticeable to me.  but the sound is clear and does sound good.  i had a little difficulty getting both devices to play simultaneously.  all and all, you can not beat it for the price.  i am ready to buy more."
4663,10,love this device for my music and audio books! use it everyday for updates on weather and sports... very clear music with great sound and bass...
4664,10,she is all i ever wanted. works great with sirius xm through out the house!
4665,14,"bought this during black friday sale. was not expecting a lot, but pleasantly surprised by the ease of use and, most important for me, the sound quality, as i use it mostly to listen to my spotify music. thinking about buying a second one soon for other rooms in the house."
4666,0,product is entertaining and informative. sometimes it can be annoying.
4667,0,i love that i can ask alexa to remind me to do something in so many minutes. i tend to hear her better than the timer.
4668,14,the sound is much richer on the echo than the dot.  my kids seem to always stump poor alexa with 20 questions.  it is a cow - alexa.  flash briefing is useful but wish the content from each provider can be customized/tweaked to your own interests.  music today sounds much like a amazon commercial.  overall this mom and her kids are very happy to share their day with alexa.
4669,14,this is an amazing device. not enough words to describe it. very enjoyable.
4670,0,love this. music is great on it. alexa knows most of the answers to our questions.5 stars.
4671,11,now the fifth echo within our home.  i can certainly hear the difference in this and my 1st gen.
4672,11,it is an echo... i like the size but i feel like the original sounded better.
4673,7,alexa frequently does not understand me and just does not respond at all or plays something i did not ask for. room for improvement but it will be fun to watch it <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0089>
4674,11,"i was hesitant based on early reviews about the sound. however, the sound is really great! crisp, clear sound with an awesome base--it fills the room! plus, i love the design of the 2nd generation. highly recommend."
4675,14,"excellent sound.  looks sharp, very responsive! even says good night!"
4676,1,love this. the speaker is very good quality. we use it on a rv both inside and out.
4677,14,great sound quality from the speaker.  not real happy that it appears to be somewhat limited in what information you can pull....thinking it is connected to the internet that you could get better info.
4678,14,it looks nice on the table in the living room.  i use it mostly to remind me to take my medicines.  i do this because i sometimes forget to take them when i get involved in a tv program.
4679,1,great volumn and device. we are really happy with alexa is help :-)
4680,0,she is so smart!!!!! it is nice to be able to ask her just about anything and get the answer and so funny how when we talk about alexa the person we have to whisper the name
4681,10,"works well, alexa recognizes my voice well. only used so far for weather and music.hope to use more in the future."
4682,4,works great.  easy to use.
4683,10,awesome sound and love the alexa app. works great with my or wifes voice.
4684,10,i love my new purchase! it answers my questions and meets my needs!!
4685,14,"these things are pretty cool, nice counter piece and sound pretty decent as well."
4686,14,i love listening to any genre and artist.  the sound is great.  i live in a ranch house and can hear it well in any room.  it was a little complicated to connect since my phone was connected to an international and national account.  customer service was amazing.  this man worked with me until the problem was resolved.  i would highly recommend this product.
4687,9,"love it ! could use a little more improving, but still great to have."
4688,11,i like the improved sound and texturized design. also the price made a difference.
4689,12,omg i love love love it!  still need to see everything that it can do but i love it! can not wait to get my fire stick for my bedroom and see the more amazing things it can to with that lol
4690,10,"my family and i really enjoy our amazon echo! my son especially enjoys the fact that he can ask her to play his favorite songs, and read him a story! alexa is great for setting alarms, playing music, and making my grocery list. my favorite aspect is that you can drop in  on other echos in the home. i am able to call the kids down for supper without having to go upstairs."
4691,14,"picked up the 2nd generation for another room. smaller but still great sound. as usual, alexa is a blast."
4692,10,"we use it to listen to music and ask it questions, its jokes are weird though, otherwise it is great."
4693,10,"i received my echo just two days ago, and i love it!  so far i have mostly  played music, and the sound is fantastic.  i have played several types of music, and it is great sound for all types."
4694,9,got the dot and was hooked so i had to the the full echo. glad i did. great sounding speaker and still learning alexa is skills. just sync would my fitbit.
4695,0,great sound. good response to questions but there have been some limitations. the music selections are a little limited and repeat often.
4696,14,yes ! this is a phenomenal product . also bought one for my parents they love it . ordered smart plugs with it . works great . voice recognition is superb
4697,10,love my echo.  play music all day long and ask alexa questions frequently.
4698,9,"bought as a christmas present for my father, he loves it. it was easy to set up and use and is great for him to get instant answers from. highly recommended for the tech savy person in your family."
4699,14,"i am just scratching the surface of all this product can do... so far i like accessing my pandora account the most, while my wife seems to like to ask when the next blackhawks hockey game is going to be. these devices are distinguishing life in the 21st century from life in the 20th for sure!"
4700,12,all i can say is i love it.  learn something new about it everyday.
4701,14,"first time owning an alexa enabled product, very interesting. when i first heard of this i was expecting the smaller dot version to be upwards of $200 but was suprised to find it to only be $50 and this one to be $100. i thought that from what i have heard and the popularity of this that i would get one and try it out. the technology these days is amazing, it is not perfect, but it has very good voice detection, can hear me just fine when talking from across the room facing the opposite way. plays spotify just fine, can get loud and the speaker is pretty good, and tells me lots of useful information with just voice command. of course it is not perfect and sometimes is not able to give you the right answer, or even an answer at all, but for the price i think it is a neat little product, especially that it will continue to improve and change."
4702,9,"got it for my dad.  he is older, but he seems to enjoy it.  likes listening to sinatra on it."
4703,0,it is convenient for my daughter and l. i like the fact that it is not big and bulky and can hear you from a distance to answer your question or request. i do not like the fact when unplugged it does not work. i thought it was wireless. besides that its a great addition to the family. alexa even helps my daughter with homework and studies.
4704,1,it works great and the responses to questions are immediate. great sound too.
4705,10,"wow, my favorite and updated too. alexa turn off all lights, lol....."
4706,11,i¡¯m so happy i purchased this echo. the audio is amazing compared to my dot.
4707,12,i love this unit.  the sound and clarity are great. still much to learn of the abilities.
4708,14,"i¡¯m impressed with her sensitivity to hearing my voice, the loudness and how she is capable of helping me organize my life!"
4709,0,cool gadget.
4710,10,we use our echo every day. mostly for music. it is such a convienence to ask alexa what music you would like to listen to.
4711,10,enjoying my echo! have wanted one for over a year and treated myself this past christmas. easy to set up and interact with and am impressed with the music sound quality. i appreciate the amazon emails i get with suggestions on how to try new things!
4712,0,"amazing will do anything i ask her, better then having a wife..."
4713,11,great item after the firmware update for sound.we love our echos
4714,9,good quality speaker. great for intercom between barn & house.
4715,10,love it. it is worked for just about everything i have tried although i use it mostly for music.
4716,14,"love my echo. improved sound quality over the 1st generation. responds efficiently (of course, the louder you have the music playing, the louder you¡¯ll have to be calling out to it). i changed my ¡®wake word¡¯ to ¡°echo¡± (due to me having three other echos in my home) and notice a slight disadvantage over the ¡°alexa¡± wake word. not worth complaining about though."
4717,0,love this guy so much! only rarely does it not understand me and that is the only real complaint i have. i use it in my salon as a stereo and also like it for the timer it has in it. i recommend it for music lovers as that is what i mainly use it for!
4718,10,"super product, we use it for control of our smart home as well as music and weather."
4719,10,"i think it is great. does a lot of cool stuff. even if you are not techy, still plays music, sets timers, reads news/weather, tell is jokes."
4720,14,its kind of spooky and was hard to set up. makes s great door stop though!
4721,11,ease of use! alexa is sensitive and responsive.sound could be better.
4722,9,we love our echo is. i have bought them for gifts for my parents and my in laws and they love theirs too.
4723,12,love it.  i have not used it to its full potential but i love having it.
4724,0,you need a smart phone for a lot of the product to work as you desire.
4725,14,echo has given me hours of enjoyment. it needs to be used by everyone.
4726,9,this has been a lot more fun than i thought!! or son got this for us for christmas :)
4727,12,"love it!  so far, i can not find any problems with it or the service from amazon!  how refreshing to find a product that does exactly what it is supposed to do."
4728,10,very helpful for getting weather sports scores. very easy to use. i can follow my sports teams. like having an audio dictionary encyclopedia. very good range.
4729,10,exceeded my expectations. i like it is responsiveness and the diverse music library for amazon music.
4730,10,we find ourselves using it mostly for music.  it sounds great. i¡¯m sure we¡¯ll expand our use in the future.
4731,14,it was the sound quality that sold me on the echo 2nd generation.  i have purchased at least four other similar streaming devices over the last couple of years (including two bose) and this one is superior hands down. the other massive amount of functionality that it offers is icing on the cake.
4732,1,wonderful sound.  lots of great music available on the echo.  simple to operate
4733,10,bought it as a gift for a friend.  works really great.  friend still trying to understand the various things that can be done with alexa.lots of fun and can be helpful in a lot of ways.
4734,14,"sound quality is a little better than my cell phone but not by much.  you have only two default music services either amazon or spotify meaning if you want to say ""alexa play a song"" it cannot without you paying a monthly fee.  you can say ""alexa play _______ on pandora"" but why cannot i make any other station my default music service?"
4735,10,i love my echo. it is so great and plays the special songs you request
4736,14,seems to me that the complete thought process was not  out before the product.
4737,14,"works beautifully once it gets set up. this took more than an hour for me with customer service help. so liked it i bought a second unit, same connection problems."
4738,10,"i¡¯m really enjoying my new echo. love being able to access all types of music, specific songs, and soothing background music or white noise. the skills games are great and alexa even had s sense of humor. i bought my infant granddaughter an echo dot for the music but her siblings highjacked it! she does not seem to mind and enjoys the impromptu dance parties"
4739,5,i bought this as a gift for my grand daughter and she loves it.
4740,11,the sound quality is quite underwhelming. both the original echo and google home sound better. the biggest improvement is in the microphone which is a lot more sensitive and can hear you even when loud music is playing.
4741,10,i was gifted with this alexa and i am amazed by it.  so easy to use and so fast!  ask it anything.  i am only beginning to learn all of it is features and abilities.
4742,10,i love the echo.  it is in my kitchen so when i run out of cooking items i just tell alexia to put it on my shopping list.  also i can tell her to play any music i¡¯m in the mood for!!!
4743,9,"best present i gave this christmas, and as often happens, i received one as a gift too!  i can say it is my favorite thing i received!"
4744,14,love the interface with sirius radio. good sound quality for price.  software a little quirky for some commands.  would buy again.
4745,9,this was a gift and she says she really loves it so there you go.
4746,14,"this item is fantastic.  it has great sound, understands speech well and has great skills. the problem?  it rarely works without an unplug or plugging back in reset.  i do not understand why because my echo dot does not have this problem.  fix this issue and it is easily a five star product."
4747,11,works great and i really like the wood grain. like how it controls other smart devices in the house
4748,9,i love this.  wish i would have had it years ago when i was working.
4749,14,"device stopped responding, had to reset. not sure how normal this is."
4750,12,so far we have enjoyed this...use it mostly for music but the speaker is great!
4751,14,"awesome for music, exploring other tools but if you have children get one of these to stay off your phone but still have good music, timers, alarms, and info"
4752,10,we love our echo. it has great sound and is so much fun to use and play trivia games on.
4753,0,given to me as a gift.  do not use it much but nice.  i would have never bought it for myself.  i just do not see the need.  it does work as advertised though.
4754,14,"i am enjoying this product, however hopefully it is skills will expand."
4755,10,i love my alexis! she is been a great addition to our living room
4756,10,instant access to music that i like and great sound!!also alexa answering my questions... fun!
4757,9,the sound is wonderful and we are getting one for our condo in florida
4758,10,"a fun and entertaining item.  use it to build my grocery list, have linked it to cozi as well.  spontaneous music source where no radio is around.  this was a gift to me."
4759,14,"microphones are not working, i have to yell while being 3 feet away for it to hear me!my dot has a better microphone compared to this"
4760,14,"i¡¯m very upset because the app it is not in mexican store and i can not access my phone , only can acces the app in the web page , you have to do something about it, i open the app in my smartphone browser and ask me to download for the app store or play store and i can not because i¡¯min mexico . and the prime it is the same issue does not work perfect in here ! so bad ,"
4761,14,"these would maybe be great, but the app does not function. thousands of reviews say the same thing... should have read that instead. too late to return them, more e-junk to clutter my space."
4762,9,love it..sounds great in my small den....use my spotify and sirius easily with this.
4763,0,"works well, sounds great but alexa can be frustrating. it does requite substantial effort to get results after play xx music and what is my daily briefing. you need to understand alexa skills, and many of the skills are not well thought out / difficult to use and the documentation is lacking."
4764,11,just like my first generation echo but slightly smaller and somewhat  better sound
4765,10,"our entire family is enjoying ¡°talking¡± with alexia. joke, silly questions, etc. most of all... i am now enjoying listening to music daily."
4766,14,i liked first version and as far as i can tell there is no important difference to second version. i had a very hard time setting up a second network using my same iphone but different echo and different wifi network. eventually i got it to work but instructions are lacking!
4767,0,"does not get the answers to much of anything which was the main reason we got it. our daughter loves trying to find out random facts, but this ended up not working the way we thought. she does like that she can ask it to play music."
4768,10,we use alexa everyday to play music in the house. she is our favorite!!
4769,11,"what can i say?  it is an amazon echo !  better than the competition, hands down!"
4770,1,the sound is absolutely amazing and i was pleasantly surprised how well it sounds.
4771,11,"easy setup, sound is definitely been upgraded from previous model."
4772,10,"i have the unit in my den, and the sound is very good.  i use it mostly to make lists, and listen to music while i read."
4773,0,does not have answers more often than not for items that are easily searched.
4774,10,sound quality is excellent.  wide selection of music.  links with my sirius radioloses wi-fi at least once a day and needs resting
4775,14,"the echo is responsive, sometimes too much so. it is always listening and does not discern between a request and something on the television. this is a known problem not solved by changing the wake up command to computer."
4776,10,love it. discovering new abilities with it everyday. alexa is becoming a family member -- quite useful too!
4777,9,received it as a gift and now alexa can answer all the questions my husband asked! life saver!
4778,14,"how did i ever live without this echo, i wake up to it playing do not worry be happy"
4779,14,i rec would this as a gift and i love it. i am very happy with the sound quality and i like all the things it will tell you. i would recommend this to anyone!
4780,7,"i have been wanting this for awhile so i gifted to myself, lol!  i love it <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+008d>"
4781,14,still playing with yes its a toy until u upgrade lights thermostat etc.
4782,10,love it! i love asking questions like what is the weather today or just playing music
4783,10,"sounds great in my opinion for my bedroom, great as an alarm"
4784,0,it is okay but she does not understand a lot and says check later?
4785,10,"we do not have a smart home, but we enjoy asking alexa questions, shouting out what we need from the store and listening to music."
4786,10,"super cool, the whole family loves it, learning new ""tricks"" everyday!"
4787,1,really a great tool and fun too.  very intuitive and alexa sings well too.
4788,14,works well but after i got it the price went down which makes it okay.......i paid to much
4789,0,very happy with alexa! we are having a good time with it. i wish it would have come with some simple directions of what all can be done with alexa.
4790,1,great sound
4791,9,"ordered it on a friday for girlfriends birthday. paid $20 for overnight shipping and got at noon on monday. long story short finally got it on the next thursday.  as far as the item, she loves it. uses it every day! looks good in the kitchen. we love playing  sirius  xm  the highway in the house.  great sounding music. bought an echo dot for bedroom."
4792,10,"it is a lot of fun to listen to the music i like, and to ask trivia questions."
4793,10,i love alexa. i love how smart she is.  its like having a persoal assistant.
4794,0,"i really liked that it can make everything way easier when you are busy. what i did not like it is the fact that if u do not pay on spotify, iheart radio or pandora, it will not play any songs from your playlist."
4795,14,"i was very excited to get my hands on the amazon echo.the family loves it. from games, to music, to audio books.the 3¡± subwoofer gives off some amazing sound quality along with the 1¡± tweeters it has.best sounding quality i have heard from a ¡°single¡± speaker."
4796,14,"it produces good sound, my only thing is that if you want to switch what it is doing, it will pause then continue what it was doing originally. e.g. if it is playing music and you want to switch to white noise it will stop for a second then continue playing music. my only way that i have found to remedy this is restarting it by unplugging it then plugging it back in."
4797,10,love this. still learning what it can do. many things to try. i mostly play my pandora stations on it and the sound is awesome.
4798,9,"love it, love it, love it.. received for christmas present and still excited."
4799,10,"love the sound quality and convenience of asking alexa to jot down lists, look stuff up and play music."
4800,11,perfect sound. do not need my blue tooth speaker any longer.
4801,5,"received my echo for christmas, great present. the sound is amazing !"
4802,12,wonderful and having fun with this product.  still learning things.
4803,14,"great addition to household.  glad to get while it was on sale.  for most part, it is been serving it is purpose to bring smart things into our home. alexa has it is limitations when searching for information but we have no complaints."
4804,14,produces amazing sound for it is size. i do not have an android phone and found it very difficult to set up with a lap top.
4805,14,"the echo sounds great. not as good as some of the bose speakers i was looking at, but at 1/3 the price, they sound amazing to me. also the integration with my smart home devices is seamless. the four star rating is due to the fact the music is not part of the routines that can be set. i hope amazon updates alexa soon to include that."
4806,10,"great sound.  fun to play with.  also, many useful attributes, such as tracking multiple times while cooking."
4807,9,it was a great gift for newly married young couple.  they¡¯re having fun with it
4808,0,enjoy but needs to work on learning more with me. echo ¡°i do not know that ¡°
4809,10,it is great.  i bought it as a christmas gift for my husband.  he was like a little kid with a new toy.  i really like that it will play all kinds of music on request.  not sure that i like the fact that it is always listening.......
4810,10,"the echo has changed my life. it should be referred to as a life-hack because it is made so many things easier for me throughout the day to news updates, daily reminders, audio playing, and purchases. i highly recommend!"
4811,9,this is the best thing since the 45.  we are amazed what it does while learning more.
4812,10,received it as a christmas gift from my husband. it was my favorite gift. i use it when i need a quick check of the weather and to play music. he also connected control of christmas lights and television to voice command. it is great! every home needs one!
4813,1,works great with everything and the music output is amazing
4814,12,love this little jewel.  we constantly find new ways to use it.
4815,9,it sure is a fun toy. so many uses. another great amazon purchase.
4816,12,this was a gift.  i am still exploring the possibilities but have fallen in love with alexa.
4817,3,it arrived on time. was as excepted. did not know you had to pay for additional appt.
4818,1,"love it!  for me, it sounds great when listening to music.  it is attractive and very functional."
4819,10,"what a neat item..so many things one can do!  educational, fun, and i especially enjoy the music!"
4820,0,i enjoy it overall. i do not like the majority of the skills and the fact that you need to enable them. and i wish it could answer questions to the depth google  can. but well worth the purchase and hoping it will continually evolve. on a side not i do not like the fact that amazon turns over echo data to the government. but not to worried as i have nothing to hide.
4821,14,"i spent six plus hours trying to set the echo up for our use.  however, even the lady on your support staff could not get it to work.  i boxed it up and sent it back to amazon and i have received a credit."
4822,14,"thanks amazon! bought three echo2s to replace current stereo system / background music in a business setting. wonderful! great sound, unlimited music without commercials! love alexa!"
4823,9,my wife loves them. we have two. we use echo to turn on devices and music throughout the house.
4824,10,alexa helps with weather timers and more. we love our alexa
4825,14,"<u+00a0>great idea, horrible execution - plain and simple.  unless you are an ""amazon house"" with all the other gadgets from amazon, i fail to see the advantage of this unit.  i researched the main competitive unit, and should have bought it as alexa is  literally ""stupid.""  it just cannot answer common questions, no matter how specific and detailed you ask.  for example, i asked ""which nfl team did adrian peterson play for during the 2016 season?"" and it wanted to give me an update to the afc and nfc championship games (which i had not watched yet).additionally, due to its inability to answer questions, i really wonder if amazon was able to utilize the google search appliance, or was somehow forced, due to competitive reasons, forced to utilize wikipedia.  i say this because i would expect alexa to answer some pretty basic questions, and if it truly could google search, it should have brought up the answer pretty easily - nope!  just amazing how bad the execution is on this thing.lastly, i received an email from amazon asking if i would take a survey to help them understand my families use of alexa.  oddly, the survey included questions like; is alexa becoming a daily habit?  do you use your smart phone or tablet less often now that you have alexa?  honestly, really?  if you want me to use alexa more, and my smart phone less often, then utilize the google search appliance and get alexa to answer basic questions...anyway, i would look elsewhere.  i am only holding onto this because i am really hoping amazon starts spending more money on software and development on this unit vs. all the marketing and ad spend they are using to increase market share.  come on amazon, do not rely on simply having a massive audience to sell ""a"" product to - make a great product that sells itself!  my daughter commented, ¡°dad, it is funny how dumb alexa is!!¡± need proof, watch this video!"
4826,0,i liked the way the echo find the songs requested.  i also like the way alexia can understand what i am asking her! very cool!
4827,11,this is a great size for night stand or kitchen. sounds and looks great.
4828,11,"like the fabric, gives it a nice look.  works as expected."
4829,1,unobtrusive in size and appearance.  nice quality sound for such a small device!
4830,1,sounds fantastic for a small unit.  i use it all the time!
4831,0,i heart radio for am wor  and fm 93.9weatheri do not have time for other stuff but enjoy having the echo
4832,0,"sound is great.  the alexa voice command works alright.  i do not like the way the alexa program tries to steer me to buy every other music selection when i have a pandora account with all my music on it.  i do not want amazon prime for that very reason.  so, 3 out of five is what i will give this beause of its rich and full sound only!"
4833,9,had to return the one i ordered. got one for christmas. love it
4834,10,"i love it!  this was a christmas present from my son!  i love asking alexa to change the temperature, playing the songs i love, and giving me weather updates!"
4835,10,"do not know how we managed without it!  love it, first thing everyday we ask questions, get time, weather, news and listen to music from our pandora station.  great way to begin the day!"
4836,3,the future is here! i love it - my only regret is that i did not buy one sooner.
4837,14,alexa is fun.  she has a wonderful speaker.  i prefer music from her to our bose speakers.
4838,0,"idk it has loud speakers i guess, does not understand me half the time, activates by itself, can not answer many of my questions, the meow mode is ehh does not interact with my cat.i do not think i really needed this in my apartment."
4839,14,absolutely amazing product! i could not be happier with it. it is far superior to the google home device! i highly recommend it. i will be buying more for myself and family. kudos amazon!
4840,4,"i loved it, the packaging was great, easy to medium complexity of configuration."
4841,0,"yes, we love alexa! she is very smart and answers most questions.  she hears her name in conversation and answers!"
4842,0,"sound was better than i thought it would be. still a lot of things it doesnt know. havent tried out a whole lot yet, but it is fun."
4843,7,"enjoying it very much, have not used all its features yet. learning all that it can do. i wish it had a batttery pack to use for outside uses or when an outlet is not available. <u+2764><u+fe0f>it!! <f0><u+009f><u+0091><u+008d>"
4844,11,"sounds fuller than the original echo we have, even though it is shorter."
4845,14,"my kids love it. my wife and i are still trying to figure out why we would need it. for my needs, it does everything my phone and bluetooth bose do already. i¡¯m 35 and grew up with tech. maybe i¡¯m missing the point of the device, but if it was not a gift i would not actively purchase it."
4846,0,"love it. would give 5 stars if not for the small issue of alex getting confused sometimes when i ask her to stop playing in a certain time frame, she confirms and stops playing right away. small issue, overall very pleased,  lots of cool skills."
4847,12,alexa is so cool. fascinating as spock would say. very usefull
4848,9,really like this product. want another two or three for house and office
4849,12,great sound!!! fun and easy to use and set up!!! it can do so much!
4850,14,it works as expected and is just a lot of fun. i also set up my outlets with it and turning things off and on with voice commands is a wonderful convenience.  the downside was the set up. i had to install and uninstall the apps several time as they would not connect to my wifi or the c temporary amazon connection was not there.
4851,10,we really like the music that the echo plays as well as asking it questions to get answers on thing that we ask it and the responses we get.
4852,10,another toy we all do not need. overlaps siri and other options.
4853,14,"like the echo plus, it is a five star product.  i am new to alexa devices but am very pleased with them.they are very useful and easy to set up  for the novice that i am.."
4854,14,"purchased as a christmas present.  second unit purchased.  good, well built."
4855,14,"i thought it would be able to answer way more questions than it does.  also, a lot of times it does not respond to the correct questions.  it also recorded a phone conversation i had with two of my friends on their cell phones.  they do not have a echo in their homes.  i found that scary.  i find google on my ipad has way more info.  i hope you improve echo soon."
4856,10,"i love my echo!!! it is clear, loud (or soft) and has been a great addition to our home. she (alexa) keeps us laughing and she is a great help too!"
4857,14,it was a christmas gift to me from my son.  big improvement in the sound quality when listening to music.  i also own two echo dots.
4858,11,absolutely love. great sound. very loud even at 5! a good buy.
4859,10,"my alexa looks great!i love my amazon echo!  she looks good in the light gray color and she sounds great !  i enjoy using alexa to play my favorite music, ask the weather, give me jokes and changing the volume with my voice."
4860,1,love it.  having fun with it. speaker sounds great when playing music of sirius radio.  very pleased with this purchase.
4861,14,love it. sound quality is fantastic and alexa can hear you easily even if loud music is on and you say her name. volume scales 1-10 so i can say ¡°alexa volume 5¡± and she will adjust it instead of having to say volume down over and over again. very satisfied.
4862,10,the echo is a great device that helps in so many ways in your daily life.
4863,14,"so far - so good... bought for feature control of lights and other smart home features.  would give it a five because it works well, however not sure it is worth the price."
4864,1,using it for lists is great.  good sound quality for listening to music.
4865,9,we received a echo as a gift from some friends. we loved it so much we bought our son one as a xmas gift. the echo is so much fun and has great sound for listening to music. everyone needs a echo !!
4866,9,"wish we would have bought this sooner, the whole family loves it!!"
4867,14,we have some connectivity issues but other than that it is great!
4868,10,"just love it!  great look, sound.  love having quick access to information and making my lists to keep me organized. excellent product, a must have"
4869,14,love it! i especially love that it will play my spotify through wifi and not bluetooth so i can still browse through videos on my phone if i need to.
4870,10,i do not care for alexa. i ask her a lot of things and she always says she does not no that one. and they are simple like ¡°how long to bake chicken in an over for¡± stuff like that. easier to look on my phone than talk to the air.
4871,9,i have the echo and bought this as a gift. i am jealous with this sound.
4872,11,great sound for such a little device. so much better than the echo dot it replaced! get one of these. you will not be disappointed
4873,11,"remarkable product, need some improvements, but is def 4 stars overall."
4874,11,"i like the looks of it most.  i was most disappointed with the sound quality and volume. i had heard 1st gen echo is that seemed to have great sound.  maybe i just got a lemon echo, i¡¯m not sure."
4875,9,"good sound quality, handy. my children treat it as a new toy."
4876,0,i love alexa just wish that there were more languages she could speak.
4877,14,i got 2 to cover the house and could not be happier.
4878,10,my daughter has the echo and likes using it. i like it is functionality.
4879,14,this thing is awesome. amazed with the sound. i guess the upgrade worked.
4880,1,bought this as a gift. very satisfied with the product and performance.
4881,14,needs to be enabled with the google search engine.  from what i have read it uses bing.  a pretty weak one.
4882,14,this is my first echo and find the sound is vey good... no issues
4883,11,got this for my living room works as it is suppose to. and is learning.
4884,10,"helpful with weather, music, as a timer, as a reader... an amazing device."
4885,10,i love the ability of my echo. every morning i get a little taste of trivia and my favorite music from days gone by.
4886,14,excellent product - get it you will be happy with the price and the quality :)!
4887,5,"my mom loves alexa. it was a christmas present that i received, but my mom stole it, and now she uses it constantly."
4888,1,"sound is ok a little lacking in bass.  functionality borders on magic, really cool product."
4889,10,we have it in our kitchen and listen to music all the time.  the sound is great!
4890,11,i have the echo 2. i heard echo 1 the speakers are not as great as the 2 nd generation. i like the spearkers on my 2nd genetation zecho.
4891,10,i love that you can just talk to alexa.  i always want to say thank you when we are finished.
4892,11,the echo works like a charm.  i have not used it as much as i liked as the area it was being used is under construction.  voice recognition is much improved over my first gen dot.  not having to pair a speaker was one of my reasons for trading up.
4893,11,liked the increased sound that the echo had over the echo dot.
4894,0,takes some learning how to use it. but nice speaker and very loud.
4895,10,plays my music and i can use the same music on other devices.
4896,11,i love everything about the echo.  the sound quality was outstanding.
4897,10,"the only drawback is the sound quality, but for the price and the amount of use i get out of this thing, it has been my favorite purchase of the last year.from getting news every morning and knowing the weather to being able to set the mood with some music and get an organized calendar, this thing does it all."
4898,2,i love my echo! the sound is amazing! so glad i purchased alexa echo!!
4899,10,love it.  play music while i am cooking and cleaning and plenty of choices on amazon music stations.
4900,12,it is a wonderful addition to the home.  i am discovering ways to use it all the time.
4901,14,i am very happy with alexa she worked out just fine it was a little tricky hooking it up and getting it working but i figured it out and since then i have enjoyed it  the sound is very good and that was important to me
4902,11,"i love the echo. the speaker for music is not the best, but still worth it."
4903,10,i like all the things it can do.  it has giving me a start to make my house a smart house
4904,14,when you combine this with amazon unlimited description you get access to all the music without having to buy cds or songs.  we did the family plan to cover multiple people and speakers.if there is room for improvement it is with joining the speakers together in an audio group (do not do it) or having it react to words that sound like alexa
4905,10,"the family is enjoying the echo.  using it mostly for music, but that alone is enough."
4906,12,"we got as a gift, and it is fun. we have not really used it much yet."
4907,14,i could not get it to work so i took it back and got a refund.
4908,10,"man,  my daughter loves this thing.. it sends like amazon adds more to it every week!"
4909,14,"the echo works well and the sound is a strong point. however, the app for getting the echo up and running is a disaster."
4910,1,great item. we really enjoy it. got it at the discount deal over the holidays and are completely satisfied. very useful!
4911,1,"i love this thing.  nice sound, good music selections.  i would recommend it."
4912,11,the bass is very improved over previous incarnation. terrific!
4913,0,"liking it for the music, but have not used it for much else yet."
4914,9,it was a gift for my daughter and son-in-law. they love it! they are already talking about getting another for upstairs.
4915,10,awesome unit!  amazing sound when you use amazon music or anything!!
4916,10,love it.  great sound when playing music.  easy to use.  fun finding all the things alexa can do.
4917,9,purchased as a gift for 2 parties -  they are enjoying their echos
4918,14,love the echo. can not wait to expand with more alexa enabled products
4919,9,"my husband loves the echo.  i bought it for him as a christmas gift and he stayed up all night christmas eve playing music, giving it commands, asking it questions.  he was like a little boy with a shiny new toy.  this may have been the best gift i have ever given him."
4920,10,"i absolutely love it. being able to access my google calendar, set alarms, dictate notes, and control my thermostat easily via voice without fumbling with my phone or computer is awesome."
4921,14,i could not get it programmed for two days i kept trying finally i got it programmed i have to push the button every time i want to talk to it it is supposed to just work like saying lexus but it does it when you download the apps to your ipad it does not work very good at all you can not go forward or back in it
4922,11,i actually prefer the fuller sound quality of the echo dot.  this one is muffled.
4923,0,"love it for music, live radio, shopping lists and smart home, but it sometimes is cumbersome when alexa does not understand the question."
4924,3,gotta love the amazon echo!  looks great - goo d price.
4925,14,blows siri out of the water. period.
4926,5,purchase this for my wife on valentine is day and we absolutely love it
4927,9,clear sound. easy to connect. alexa is great. i am impressed.
4928,11,"sound great !  not as good as sonos, but  much better than generation one echo. wort the money when on sale"
4929,0,it looks nice and i like it. i will probably like it better as i learn to use it more.
4930,14,awesome!!!turn up the heat in the house.turn on the car.
4931,9,"i love this thing! it is like having a really smart person in the house! it works well, and the sound is fantastic!"
4932,14,"the amazon echo definitely met my expectations, so much that i bought myself a second one. at times it can have a hard time hearing me, but overall really great device. alexa is constantly getting new skills and features, and if you¡¯re a amazon prime member the benefits get even better. i would highly recommend this for anyone."
4933,14,sound is great. voice recognition is great still haven;t figured out how to drop in on my other echo
4934,12,sound is really good.  i like the echo but i feel there is a lot more that we can do with it.  games are fun. happy with the purchase.
4935,14,"amazing sound and adept alexa make this a must have appliance.not totally comfortable being so dependent on an internet connection, but it certainly is a useful device, especially with pairing to amazon music. lot of useful utilities in alexa is repertoire, happened sued them all yet."
4936,10,love  it. news weather jokes stories  my book audiables so much more games
4937,14,"convenient voice activated gadget for playing music from services like spotify.  adequate sound when not connected to higher end audio. good for weather updates, news radio, etc. down side is post christmas pricing too high.  alexa does not really needs to develop broader information base...basically a novelty gadget other than music player interface."
4938,10,"not much information came with it as to how to use it so i am having a large learning curve. gone to websites to try to learn as much as i can. just found out last night i can use ""her"" as an alarm clock. i keep trying new things all the time."
4939,14,"i love it, if you don,t have one. you do not know what your missing!"
4940,10,"love it.  use it every day for weather, pandora, jokes, news, etc."
4941,0,"works very well for what it does. amazon could let it do a lot more things that it clearly has the capability for, but some strategy of theirs keeps it limited. we can always hope."
4942,14,"great sound, nice look.  volume setting needs a position between 2 and 3."
4943,1,great speaker and talking to alexa is fun for everyone.
4944,10,got this for my mom & sister. my mom thinks alexa is her new dj friend who plays any song or artist she wants. just to hear her argue with alexa is the funniest thing. best purchase ever!
4945,10,"echo does not give me much that i can not get with a radio, cd player, and cell phone.  it is cool that it responds to voice requests, but the information is already available."
4946,11,"love the size ,looks ,and  sound but it does not hear as well as a dot."
4947,0,alexa needs major improvement. sometimes she can not even find simple questions sometimes.
4948,0,"a lot of the questions i ask, gets the response i can not answer that. it is good once you realize you have to link your system with skills from the app. but it is no google! i wanted this so i when i want to know something i could just ask it, but i still find myself going to my phone to google."
4949,10,"love my echo. it is fun, and convenient to get answers to questions, and to play music."
4950,11,love it.  i like the music the best but it is just so much fun overall.
4951,11,works as expected. sounds quality is definitely better than original
4952,14,first time using this technology and am quite impressed as i learn what it can do.device well madepackaging was top shelf and exuded quality.  very impressed
4953,1,"looks great, sounds great and is a welcome addition to my alexa collection"
4954,14,i really liked alexa. it does a great job for the price. only negative is that it does not work with dish network. i tried to link a couple times and also have two case # open with amazon for over a month with no response on how to fix the problem. after reading reviews i realize more people is dealing with the same problem.
4955,11,excellent product ... great sound!  it does seem to have a longer response time than the 1st generation unit - but that may just be me!
4956,10,easy setup. alexa helped! love it especially for reminders and timers
4957,11,the echo sound quality is not as good as the more expensive model.
4958,14,my wife became best friends with alexa 12/25/17. they communicate almost every day. just last evening they were addressing each other while making cupcakes. my wife sings in the church choir and i hear the two of them practicing songs quite regularly. i thought about getting one for the bedroom but i am afraid of what it might do to our relationship.
4959,11,"my 2nd echo device, which is very useful and enjoyable."
4960,11,well improved hearing capability in comparison to the 1st generation.
4961,14,"just enough sound for my main common area, i¡¯ll probably get another one over time to round out the mix. i already had a dot, and alexa still gets a bit confused with multi-room music. a small thing but with the extra sound."
4962,10,"we love alexa in our house. she is a game, friend, fact and meteorologist, personal assistant, singer, and dj. so many uses and i can tell so worth it"
4963,14,great job amazon. this is the only voice recognition device that understands my funny accent out of the box. siri is useless and i turned her off on all my apple devices.
4964,14,"flash briefing just stopped working this a.m., did all the standard, unistall, update, etc., etc...anyone else have this issue...?"
4965,0,was more difficult to get set up than i thought it would be. takes a lot of time to set up things so it does not keep saying i do not know that.
4966,9,good addition in our house. works great. like the ability to communicate with our echo dot in another room. it is like have an intercom system.
4967,11,"so much better than my dots in ability to hear me, and sound output quality."
4968,10,it is great for so many reasons. the music and the quick information instead of going to google. highly recommend.
4969,14,"i love everything about this device! the sound is so crisp, my favorite thing to use on it is sleep sounds. the dolby sound is amazing to the soothing sounds of wind, rain forest, box fan, thunder storms etc... definitely worth buying!!!!!!"
4970,14,lots of fun.  keep using it by following the suggestions amazon provides weekly.  well worth the price.  excellent sound.  especially good for people who live alone.
4971,10,my kitchen hub! i use it to play me music and news and learn german while i cook.
4972,14,just got this for my husband is birthday and let me begin by saying we are very pleased !! the sound is super loud she responds fastley and accurately they setting up was alittle time consuming but other wise we are thourghly happy!
4973,9,"love it! my dad gave it to me as a gift, i can literally go anywhere in my house or someone house plug it and boom we got music and a great time. my parents loved it and everyone in my family! i use it even at night time for my daughter to go to sleep. my 4 year old even talks to it and put the music she wants! must buy and i really recommend! great gift too!"
4974,10,"great sound quality. we use it for home automation, messaging family, music, games, weather, podcasts and streaming radio."
4975,11,this generation is not as good as the first generation. it understands so much less and times out all the time.
4976,9,it is definitely cool. kids love talking to alexa. great for music and sound quality is amazingly better than expected from such a small speaker.
4977,9,this is a great item! we have enjoyed alexa and her many useful tools.
4978,0,great product. wish you could ask anything but still limited.
4979,11,"sound is not nearly as good as the 1st gen echo. i also miss the volume dial.if you are getting this after owning the 1st gen, you will likely be disappointed."
4980,5,i gave this as a gift to my daughter for christmas and she loves it!
4981,10,hands down the best speaker i have ever owned. i highly recommend this to everyone.
4982,14,"a must have if you are a music subscriber. very loud speaker! great for listening to music or audiobooks. it will respond to words that are extremely close to the wake words (alexa <u+2248> alexis). so mid conversation, whether on the phone or in person, do not be surprised if it randomly responds. that does not stop me from giving it 5 stars! great product."
4983,0,"i got the unlimited songs and it never has the song i ask for. it is a waste of money, unless you need a fancy timer."
4984,0,mostly love it. although she does not seem to know a lot of the answers to the questions i ask.
4985,10,it turns on my light when i ask it to and plays my lumineers station as needed. nuff said.
4986,10,i love playing my music on this as well as control my home automation
4987,14,i could not get it to do anything but connect to the last station i listened to on iheart. not to mention it took hours to get it connected to just that. total disappointment and i returned it.
4988,4,easy to setup; small and adorable.very loud and very user friendly.
4989,9,"it is in the kitchen...we added two of the ""pucks"" in rest of home.  love it."
4990,1,"the ultimate home assistant! sound is pretty good, considering it is size."
4991,14,while a very neat piece of equipment it did not meet my personal expectations. i was looking for a high quality portable bluetooth speaker. while the alex function is great i have siri in my pocket at all times who can answer all the same questions.
4992,10,i love that i have access to music with beautiful sound by asking alexa for it.
4993,9,"this was a christmas gift, it is a very nice looking echo but i still live my echo 1st gen. also i will be buying a echo show for my kitchen in white. both of my other ones are black"
4994,0,this is a fun way to get information and listen to music. ¡°she¡± does not answer all the questions but it is amazing what it does.
4995,9,great product. music quality is amazing. kids learning skills are awesome and other skills are great for adults too.
4996,10,we love it. sounds great and can now listen to any music with ease. ask alexa anything!!! sme will come through.
4997,3,it does everything as expected and sound quality is good enough.
4998,10,"i love this, and i learn a new way to use it almost every day."
4999,10,love it! i have wanted one for so long and im so glad that we finally have alexa in our house. she helps solve arguments and decide what for supper. makes tons of list. love it.
5000,9,"since getting the amazon echo 2nd generation, on christmas my husband can not stop using it it is definitely the best gift i ever gave him... its so great... love playing different songs, games and audible reading id great for falling asleep.."
5001,9,we love it. the whole family uses it including grandchildren 4 and 7.
5002,14,"this echo speaker 2nd generation sounds great.  however, sometimes i ask a question, it goes offline and can not help.  but, in the back of the house, the echo dot, 1rst gen, responds."
5003,0,"excellent machine, works great when ever you have a question or when you need things done in house that works with alexa."
5004,1,"fast delivery, good product  voice sound very much like alexa"
5005,5,a christmas gift from my son i am 76 and i am learning to use it.
5006,11,surprized at the level of volume from the size that it is. works great! love it!
5007,9,my husband loves his echo!! i think alexa is a riot!! ask her jokes!
5008,14,"i wish that echo can be smarter by practicing. the music list in amazon is not that satisfied because some music such as ""10 seconds"" by aoa are not included. i hope that there will be more asian music in it"
5009,0,"i love the echo. while i am only using basic functions at the moment, it does everything i could ask it to do"
5010,0,"i had hoped to listen to local news, music, happenings but no. i might be doing something wrong."
5011,11,operates just as expected clear understanding of all voice commands great sound.
5012,10,"still new for my sweetheart but he is loving it so far! nice speaker system too! enjoy the 3 question game, good challenge game.  worth the $!"
5013,14,"i love my first echo. this one is just ""meh"". you have to be right on top of it for it to hear anything."
5014,14,"this is our second echo. when we have people over, it is nice to play music around the house. it is also nice to listen to music while doing the dishes or putting up seasonal decorations, taking a bath... all with my voice!"
5015,10,"my son bought this for me as a christmas present. i love alexa...although i had to threaten to ask siri a couple of times lol. but seriously, i play music, ask her random questions and loves that she can turn my door light on when asked (with smart adapter). definitely a great addition to my home."
5016,11,"i started off with the echo dot, and then bought the echo 2nd generation. i wish i would have bought two of the echo 2nd generation.  i use this every day in my office and love it is versatility, sound, and size.  i will be getting one for my bedroom as well."
5017,10,"love getting my news briefs in the morning while making coffee. also has a very nice sound for my music. i bought one for a christmas gift and then bought myself one,  great product!"
5018,1,great high-class look. the product is amazing. we use it all the time...for everything.
5019,11,"i really enjoy this smart home device. controls everything i need with voice commands very easily. amazing speaker sound/music quality!! talking to alexa is very easy and it picks up your voice from quite a distance, even when you have music playing.  highly recommended for the price!!"
5020,0,"i have had my echo for a couple of months now and i absolutely love her.  i know that i am not using her to her full potential, but i do not mind.  i love being able to listen to music by just asking her to play certain songs.  she seems to have no trouble at all understanding my commands.  i would recommend the echo to my family and friends."
5021,14,"bought it for the music/sound,,, not disappointed! deep sound for a little unit. we are getting more and more used to the limits we can go!"
5022,14,2d gen connects to wi-fi better than 1st generation.
5023,11,"nice color, smaller than 1st generation great sound."
5024,12,very exciting product.  have not even tapped into the potential!
5025,9,"my husband, a gadget freak, loves it and uses it every day."
5026,10,"great sound, as a prime member i can play all of the music i purchased plus much more."
5027,4,i love it. the sound is great and it was super easy to get it set up.
5028,5,my 90-year-old mother loves it and marvels at it daily.
5029,1,"love the powerful speaker in such a small thing ,love the questions and reminded"
5030,9,"this was a present for my wife, excellent - gets well used"
5031,11,nice unit.  easy setup.  has better base than the gen 1 unit.alexea is getting better at understanding me as well.
5032,14,i wish it could play my iphone music like every other bluetooth speaker on the market. it is frustrating when companies sacccrifice user experience for corporate competitiveness. the devise is otherwise amazing. if only there was not an annoying flaw.
5033,14,"good sound quality when it works. terrible ¡°reception¡± can not have my phone more than tour- five feet away without getting terrible, and i mean terrible service. worse than trying to listen to the radio on a road trip in the middle of no where. i actually prefer to listen to my iphone than the alexa speaker because i can not be away from the device."
5034,14,"my amazon echo has proven to be very useful for general information and turning my tv on and off, and it sounds pretty good as a bluetooth speaker as well."
5035,11,best echo for the money. good sound. shorter size is good. microphone sensitivity is excellent.
5036,10,"talk about a new toy for a grandma.  having a blast with alexa, trying new games and laughing a lot.i will keep trying new things every week. grandchildren love it too. was a great christmas gift for me."
5037,7,i have several of these... they are seriously the best thing ever <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0089>
5038,4,"fun, excellent and informative! echo is a great device! easy to use - simple to learn. the music sounds great over it also!"
5039,9,best christmas gift!  she listens better than my loved ones at home.  she is somewhat dumb when it comes to football trivia but i overllook that.
5040,10,love this! it is making my schedule easier and i use alexa all the time!
5041,10,"after receiving the echo, i havee found so many fun things to do. the sound syystem is awesome. trying to find and use all of the skills can be somewhat of a hassle."
5042,14,"sound quality is amazing! i was going to purchase the more expensive echo that was priced at $149, then after reading reviews both on amazon and elsewhere, all pointed to this one. i just wanted a great speaker with bells and whistles. the ai is fun and pretty cool. highly recommend!"
5043,14,do not have to get my butt out of my chair.  short learning curve.  bought 3 dots for the kids.  make sure to set them up so the kids cannot drop in on you!  nada negative to this point.
5044,14,alexa gets a make-over!  the technology is as wonderful as the first gen. i do not really hear any difference in the new speaker. it is certainly not markedly different.
5045,14,great device but if the volume is up she will not turn off and never understands what i want when i¡¯m drinking so it turns in to a screaming match and she wins and i give up but over all friends say our feud is entertaining
5046,10,bought it for my grandson. i ask to let me here it. great sound
5047,12,"still learning about everything this device will do, it is amazing"
5048,14,im very please with this purchase i plan to get another one very soon
5049,9,bought 3 for christmas gifts ... my nieces and nephew love them ...
5050,10,fun but the novelty wears off.  i use it mostly to play music
5051,14,"the dot was more receptive to commands. the echo for some reason has a harder time hearing what we were requesting often replying i do not know or not replying at all sometimes. the only difference between dot and echo should be the speaker, but we liked our dot more."
5052,12,amazing device with excellent sound and functionality. we keep discovering more.
5053,11,"voice recognition is very weak, as compared to google voice and garmin voice recognition systems"
5054,0,it does not meet my expectations. a lot of the time she tells me she does not have the facts
5055,14,like the color and texture. seems it will last a long time.
5056,11,sound is better than expected. happy with my purchase.
5057,0,i just got it. a lot of good things. learning a lot  too.
5058,0,"it is new, i have so much to learn.  i would not want to be without it."
5059,14,works as expected. the oak outside makes it look unique which i like.
5060,11,works great as the first generation but looks sleeker!
5061,10,works great can ask almost any question and we receive an answer...
5062,14,great item. has lived up to expectation so far. we are slowly going about turning our home into a smart home and this has met all our needs so far. only problem is when i am watching tv and one of the characters is named alexa. just kidding.
5063,10,"i love any song i can request coming up on there. when i am in my den and i talk to echo i am doing my work it is so pleasant to hear soft music to help me concentrate. also, history questions are answered, and any other question might have about current affairs. what i dislike about it is pretty simple. i can not put it in my pocket and take it anywhere i go."
5064,14,absolutely love the echo! makes life so much easier and organized. great volume! there cpuld be some upgrades as to the questions you can ask and abilities. also i have difficulty correctly syncing my echo dot
5065,14,grandson loves his alexa! uses it for many this. - to turn on his room light. to turn on his ps4. weather report b4 school. i will be buying myself one soon!
5066,11,"i love the size, the color grey is prefect for my bedroom decor and it works perfectly.  i am 100% satisfied with this echo."
5067,14,good sound. do not like having to pay $9.99 a month for music though
5068,9,i use it all the time. my husband and i really like it.
5069,9,my 83 year old father is visually impaired. information and music as well as audible books are wonderful.
5070,11,very good echo will buy more when it goes on sale .
5071,1,"this thing is amazing!  so informative, fun and useful. sound for its size is incredible!"
5072,9,i love this echo.  the sound is great!!  i was so impressed i purchased a second one.
5073,12,works very well and sounds good. you can do a lot with an echo.
5074,9,got this as a christmas gift. am enjoying it! was not aware it did so much.
5075,14,"at first it seemed pretty good.  but then it stopped being connected to my iphone x, says there is a pairing problem.  so now i can not use it from my phone...only use it as a radio for the music.  i do not know if it is an update issue or what, but the menus do not give you a lot of information or options."
5076,9,bought for wife. she likes the sound it produces in her bedroom.
5077,1,"nice compact personal assistant with great surround sound speakers, very easy to setup.  i use it primarily for playing music and for general information."
5078,14,"wonderful little tool for listening to music.  had some difficulty connecting to the calendar, but that was rectified by a phone call to your support staff.  we only utilize maybe 20% of it is capability since we turn our lights on and off, we still adjust our temperature, lock our own doors, and still do not need assistance finding our bathroom."
5079,0,"the sound from this echo is great i live in a 2000 sq ft home and i play music and can hear it in most of rooms in the house with clearity. m making list for grocerys etc, settng times , reminders its great. there is a voice control problem because it well at anytime just spout out words about what ever not sure what that is all about when it does that."
5080,1,product works amazing - speakers is clear.  our 2nd one.
5081,9,we love our christmas gift to each other.  works great
5082,11,really like it has louder sound looks really nice.
5083,14,"i have a number of dots, but the speaker in this is so much better"
5084,10,amazing sound and verbal response.  both i and my wife love it.
5085,11,the sound quality is much better than i expected. i am using it in my living room for an easy way to play music all of the time.
5086,14,"difficult to use, does not play music from my phone (apple), and requires music subscription to play music (which cost more money).  also requires constant power connection - not wireless.  when you play music from amazon library, such as ""90 is hip hop"" it will play the same small group of songs over and over in the same order.  very disappointing."
5087,11,so cool and useful! better options than 1st gen. and more compact.
5088,11,"sound is great, just what i needed for my old ears.  alexa is not as smart as siri, but getting there.  looks good on a desk."
5089,14,the family is really enjoying alexa.  kind of bummed it does not pair with itunes but i get it.  i will be ordering a dot to link to very soon.
5090,9,"i love my alexa, it is like having company. my husband was pleasantly surprised."
5091,9,love alexa....my third.  can now have surround sound!
5092,5,purchased for a neighbor as a gift. very happy with the product.
5093,10,such a tremendous help and convenience. do not know how i did without it.!
5094,1,"we love our new echo , alexa is awesome, and at a great price too."
5095,4,easy to set up with really great sound. what is not to like?
5096,5,love this new echo............so much funwill purchase again as a xmas gift
5097,10,awesome!!  we love our echo and alexa!  lot is of fun and has changed our family vibe at home with all genre is of music playing at all hours of the day!  amazing product!!
5098,10,good for us old fellas that need help with spelling and word definitions. love it
5099,5,this was a christmas gift from my son and i love it.
5100,1,the sound was very impressive for such a small object. i highly recommend owning an echo.
5101,9,works very well and enjoying the many uses of alexa. everyone should have one.
5102,14,"i am very disappointed in my purchase of amazon echo.i debated a long time before i actually purchased this unit instead of google home.every time i read about the wonderful things i could do with it, i was impressed.the first thing i noticed was that to get the full benefit of those wonderful things was to purchase prime which added another $99.then, i already have sirius radio so i could listen to that by just syncing my account - oh, wait, even though i already pay $300 for two cars, i have to add another tier for $50.ok, i have a samsung smart tv, i can get amazon movies - oh, no, that is connected through comcast xfinity and that does not talk to amazon like netflix or youtube. no app available. maybe someday (most likely never) so i¡¯ll have to watch netflix until that happens.but with prime i can watch amazon movies on my tablet or my pc or my phone (that is comfortable). great - now i can watch that amazon movie that is getting all the awards - the handmaid is tale - sure, if i buy it by the episode or the season.i thought i was also going to be able to get audio books - sure i get one free this month (self-help) but anything else is another fee. (i did not even bother to look up the cost).i do get music but that also is limited. today, i got a message that i could listen to camila cabello. i just saw her on gma and liked her music but that will only last until january 25.of course, there are all those games i can play with alexa but i¡¯m not desperate enough to rely on playing a game with an electronic cylinder just yet.ok, the sound is great; i¡¯ll give you that but that is only because i opted for the echo instead of the dot which, of course, was more expensive.but then, i did get an increase in my social security benefit - i wonder what i should spend that $1.37 a month on?"
5103,14,"compared to google home i love that it sounds better, richer bass. it is definitely listening in the background. it is very interesting what alexa comes up with. will def buy another."
5104,10,"great functionality. tells weather, plays music, it is customizable,  soothing night time sounds, can shop with it, obtain order status, watch movies, play games, obtain info from internet, and the list goes on."
5105,11,great sound... nice deep tone compared to original
5106,10,love it for music & weather but she needs a lot of improvement
5107,1,i am impressed with the sound quality. it is very easy to use.
5108,9,"got this as a christmas gift, love it so much we bought two more."
5109,1,it is amazing and the sound is very good when playing music
5110,14,"it is amazing for music.  the standard commands you need to use it, or make it function, needed a lot of research. got the book from amazon for kindle and it really helps out.  could have done better with starting commands."
5111,1,love the sound quality nice base for such a small speaker and having the alexa is such a cool tool to interact with on a daily basis.
5112,10,"this is a great device. we get our weather, music, trivia, etc. everyday!"
5113,0,"it is fun, but ¡®as purchased¡¯ it is pretty limited on knowledge and music selections! have not yet upgraded what she keeps reminding me to do."
5114,0,"alexa is not intuitive. i get many wrong answers and i often get ""i do not know that"". it is very frustrating. a simple question like ""where is the lincoln center located?"" gets a wrong answer. all she could find was lincoln city. i am not happy with it."
5115,12,i love my alexa! i learn something new everyday that she can do!
5116,14,"i love my echo, so glad to have it. plays so clear. i recommend echo to anyone that loves playing music, every song you can think of is available, no c.d.'s or players to buy, so convenient, can move it from room to room, do not have to turn it on & off, (your voice does it).  wonderful color, heather gray is soft & looks nice."
5117,14,"excellent information source, good music , somewhat difficult at times to determine type of music available from amazon prime versusamazon music"
5118,10,excellent device - have enjoyed having it available immensely!
5119,0,"cool devise, ask it anything and you will get a very accurate answer."
5120,12,a wonderful addition to my home. still have a lot to learn about its use.
5121,14,it is a perfect addition to my amazon devices. improvement from the first generation echo device.
5122,9,i have 2 echo is and 2 dots and this 2nd generation echo works great with the other units.  love having these to be able to communicate with people in other rooms...easy to use.
5123,9,"i am amazed more everyday at how much i love this! it controls my lights, cameras, etc., in addition to always being available for information, and entertainment. just ordered a small one for the bedroom."
5124,9,"i did not know too much about ""echo"". my sister bought on and my husband just had to have one. we love it and so does my grand daughters.  she (echo) has amazing knowledge about anything. worth every penny! i would recommend to everyone."
5125,2,love love love my echo. the sound quality is amazing.
5126,9,really like the product as this our third echo in the house.
5127,14,received my echo (2nd gen) for christmas. thank you santa !!!  love it!!  i¡¯m still learning her capability. i could not be more pleased with her sound quality<u+2014>awesome!! i¡¯m an amazon prime member so she can search their library and play almost anything i ask for i want another one for upstairs
5128,10,we love the convience of asking questions and playing a variety of music
5129,14,i received my device as a wonderful christmas surprise and i have been enjoying getting to know alexa is capabilities. i am really liking calling up songs that i have not heard in years :) i do want to connect to more speakers and louder ones if possible. is there a louder speaker for alexa?
5130,14,"the sound quality from such a small speaker is excellent and the base response is natural and adequate..  others have criticized the base response but i do not find this a criticism in my case..  i find the extra charge for the oak, and silver cases over the cloth cases excessive..,  alexa performs admirably.r"
5131,0,it does sound some better.  it would be nice if it could answer more questions
5132,10,"this is the best product i have purchased in years,  i am always asking alexa questions and relying on it for information and entertainment"
5133,14,"only wish you did not have to subscribe to amazon prime to really take advantage of everything that is possible with this unit.  not much choices without amazon prime.  sad you have to subscribe to a service to take advantage, and if they do this, they should give a discount for those that have an echo."
5134,14,"love my echo!  i do not know how i got along without alexa this long!  i first tried google is spot and really if you use amazon a lot and have prime membership, you can get a lot more with echo.  i purchased the heather gray model and it just fits in so well on my tabletop."
5135,0,"sound quality is excellent.  had a difficult time understanding how to get music.  also, in setting up a playlist.  still not sure we know how to use it, as when i go to amazon music to work on my playlist, and then ask the echo to play it, it is not a smooth transition.  more instructions would have been very helpful."
5136,14,service by dealer great. the product was a x-mas present to someone.
5137,14,"i was looking to solve my music problems with this device. not a chance. it has to be 20' from with wifi or it does not work. well, i dont live in a 20x20 box, so that is next to impossible. amazon in general is slipping. my echo is not compatible with my tap either. i will be returning both items."
5138,10,"love it.  it is practical for setting timers and alarms, but it is fun to play around with also."
5139,11,what a great product the sound quality is remarkable comparable to bose or much higher priced products i have never herd a speaker so small with this much room filling sound ! magnificent!!!
5140,14,"12/3 i was so excited to receive this but i have been unable to get it working. first it sputtered over setting up correctly but after a few tries it finally worked (i am not a novice - i have two echo dots which i have set up without any issues). then it refused to play any music - whether that is from the radio, prime music or any other source. it was acknowledge what i was asking for (demonstrating that it understood and was connected to the internet) but then would do absolutely nothing. amazon email customer support said they were aware of the issue and that the engineering team would solve it soon. as i looked for other reviews and forum postings noting the same issue, i realized that what amazon customer service was telling me was pure fiction because i could not find anyone with the same issue. unplugging and re-plugging in would cause it to work but only temporarily so i wrote back to customer support who asked for me to call them. they got me to restore to factory settings and after this it worked for a while. but then it stopped working altogether - dead. completely dead. i un/re-plugged in and it started up but now i could not connect to wifi. i called customer support and two tech folks later they agreed to replace. i then got an email from amazon stating that i should both return the defective unit to them and dispose of it. i have absolute faith that amazon would do the right thing and indeed they are but boy....it took too many phone calls, too many questions to determine what i always knew - that the unit was defective and even then customer service is response was contradictory and confusing (i still dont know whether i have to return the defective unit!?!). i really hope the replacement is better as it seems much nicer in so many ways to the echo dot. i will update this review when i get it up and running but i want to post this so that anyone else that has the same issue knows they are not alone."
5141,3,do not know how we lived before this was invented.
5142,13,greatest thing ever created. nothing more to add.
5143,14,"purchased as a gift, will know soon how it works and will post an update if there are any issues."
5144,9,absolutely love it!!! should have gotten one for each room!!!
5145,11,"echo dot worked great - but this 2nd gen is slow to respond, often just does not respond, and just does not work well at all."
5146,11,"the sound is better then the original one,and it can hear better"
5147,10,i am in love with this! my only regret is not buying two simply because she can not hear me from the other side of the house where i can clearly hear her. this thing is amazing for cleaning. my kids even love it cause she knows their weird trending songs etc. she always knows just what to play for me too!
5148,14,alexa is fantastic! the echo is sleek and stylish. the whole family enjoys the versatility this device offers! we can not wait to finish integrating the home with alexa compatible smart tech.
5149,14,"i never write reviews but i felt that i should for this great item. i will start off by saying the sound is actually pretty nice, now do not go expecting a speaker that has a ton of bass but this is a pretty good sounding speaker. i love the size of it, it is perfect form factor size not to big not to small. all in all, i must say it is a good buy."
5150,7,learning something new every day. no regrets <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0080>.
5151,10,"oh definitely something to have, alexa is great."
5152,3,it is an item you never thought you needed until you have it. then you wander how you managed to get by so long without it. it is amazing.
5153,10,"i do not know how i lived without this. everything in my life is so much easier. buy it. if you like listening to music, audiobooks, being organized, being up to date with news or basically anything do it."
5154,0,blown away. love it! learning more and more about her every day!
5155,5,christmas gift for my parents. they love it. very pleased.
5156,14,a family member has the echo and i thought it was a great way to listen to music. great sound! i saved my money so i could buy it for my home. it came yesterday and i have been enjoying it. learning as i go as i am a senior citizen.
5157,12,i love this still learning how to use it but super happy with it
5158,9,my son loves his!  he can turn on lights in his bedroom by giving alexa a command.  he loves the jokes he hears.
5159,11,nice improvement over the first generation.  the sound is noticeably better and i like the smaller size.  i did like the manual volume control on the original that is now gone.....price of progress.
5160,9,my daughter loves it!  she is really amazed at all alexa can do. easy setup!
5161,0,love alexa! this device answers questions very accurately and fast. love music option.
5162,14,alexa is handy for many things but we primarily use it as a bluetooth speaker and timer for cooking. half the time she would not really do the command. maybe more time needs to pass and more upgrades to the app
5163,11,shocked at the improvements over the first generation.  very nice.
5164,9,i love it. the convenience of the timer alone. already ordered an echo dot and have recommended to family.
5165,7,does not answer medical questions <f0><u+009f><u+00a4><u+00b7><f0><u+009f><u+008f><u+00bc><u+200d>¡Î<u+fe0f>just refer to dictionary <f0><u+009f><u+00a4><u+00ac> seems lost on questions <f0><u+009f><u+00a4><u+00b7><f0><u+009f><u+008f><u+00bc><u+200d>¡Î<u+fe0f> is good for music and weather <f0><u+009f><u+0091><u+008d>
5166,12,it is so awesome!!!
5167,12,"we are really enjoying this purchase and are amazed at the many functions/skills. unique, helpful, and fun!"
5168,11,big improvement over the echo dot.  great sound. very pleased with it.
5169,11,"i have both the 1st and 2nd generation versions. while both are very good, i think that the 2nd generation has slightly better sound."
5170,10,great device that lets me listen to music i like all day long.
5171,14,works as described....use with the multi group for better coverage in the house.
5172,3,i had no idea how much i would like this. it sounds great!
5173,12,"have not had much time to play with it et, but enjoying it so far!"
5174,12,i am just getting to know alexa and have not taken advantage of all her capabilities.
5175,11,i miss the volume twist top ring from the generation 1.  other than that it works just the same.
5176,10,the first thing i do in the morning is ask alexa the weather for the day.
5177,9,it was a gift to me and i am still navigating.  the cover is awesome.
5178,12,good speaker. some of the skills need work. i am learning(lots to know) as i go.
5179,9,we loved our dot so we decided to get this one.  it did not disappoint.  the sound that comes out of the speaker iffabulous.  i would be tempted to order another one.
5180,11,very big improvement with sound! do not need a bluetooth speaker to increase volume.
5181,9,this was my fifth echo and my first full sized alexa. i have these throughout the house and can not imagine doing without them.
5182,9,this is the best speaker we¡¯ve ever purchased. love the convience of being able to listen hands free!! i¡¯ve not only purchased one for myself but also two family members as gifts and they were huge hits. defiantly recommend this!!
5183,10,"i received this as a gift. it is nice to have, convenient to get music and information quickly."
5184,12,i am still learning what alexa can do but very nifty gizmo.
5185,3,"love my alexa.....how i lived without it, i do not know...."
5186,9,"enjoying my echo - in fact, i ordered two dots and received those today. loving the technology."
5187,1,looks good.  sounds good.  works good.  priced good.  it is all good.
5188,14,it worked and was able to be used for about 3 day is ... then it quit connecting to the wifi and has not been able to sync ever since .. horribly disappointed
5189,0,i¡¯m so glad i got this. being able to walk in and day ¡°alexa start pandora¡± and she does! that i¡¯m itself it worth the money!
5190,14,"not useful unless a fully automated house, rarely understood my voice, too expensive"
5191,5,it was a gift for my daughter-in-law from my son. she loved it.
5192,0,"it is smart, sounds great and is almost like having an assistant. i have not tried stumping it yet, but i kinda think it¡¯ll be able to handle it."
5193,0,"i love this thing! speaker quality  is amazing, there is all kinds of stuff you can do with it! a few times it glitches off but not often for it to be a problem."
5194,14,i like the equipment. but trying to get registered and set up an account for endless music is very difficult and confusing. i am not a computer wizard but my wife has even tried to set up an account to have the music and all i ever get is a notice that there is a problem with my payment procedure. it is very aggravating but i think that is on amazon.
5195,14,"it is really cool. it flashes different lights which mean different things, which is a cool improvement. the speaker is nice. alexa just has a hard time picking up my voice. i have to repeat ¡°alexa¡± multiple times for her to respond. it is disappointing. i got this new and improved model, but i guess it is not improved."
5196,10,beautiful to look at and listen to. i wish i could access my synology server to listen to my own music.
5197,11,"great new design, good sound and compact design.  i do miss the rotory volume control on 1st generation"
5198,14,"i purchased my alexa before christmas, i was so excited to get started.  only big problem i have is when i ask her to do random songs it breaks up, will hear the music, then it stops 30 seconds or less the song will return, very annoying.  i have no problems with weather, news, shopping list.  please help me answer this problem. thank you."
5199,11,"sound is great for the price, but i do not feel full surround."
5200,14,it does not work as well as one i bought from electronic express. it does alot of weird things like just start playing music by itself or responding when not asked anything.
5201,1,i love it. great value for the quality and functionality.
5202,5,it was a christmas gift but i do know they loved it.
5203,7,if you have any questions on how to do something. just ask her she will tell ya. great family gift!! <u+2764><u+fe0f><u+2764><u+fe0f><u+2764><u+fe0f> she even replies to my daughters name alyssa sometimes lol
5204,7,we love our echo !! <u+2764><u+fe0f> it is fun and will make your life joyful <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0080>
5205,14,"the echo can be useful but unless you buy additional amazon services such as music unlimited, you will not get full functionality of this item. its quite the disappointment."
5206,1,wonderful sound!  the sound from this is just as high quality as the tower.
5207,5,bought it for my brother for christmas. he loves the sound quality.
5208,9,i got this for christmas and it is been great. i¡¯m learning to use all the features. the music is the best.
5209,0,i like it however it gives me the local weather in medford... i live in walpolea little annoying ...
5210,0,works ok. had to change her name to echo. it was answering to my daughters name.
5211,9,"so far we are loving it! playing around with the music and locking/unlocking our adp pulse is super fun too! sometimes alexa does not understand what we are saying but hey who gives a damn! i¡¯m excited!!! got the kids one each, got my mother one, our kitchen and our room!! we love it!!"
5212,10,"best price in town. such an ez settup proses, even for the ¡°technology challenged ¡° person such as myself. it is fun to use. i have a 10 and 6 year old they ask it all sorts of questions and alexa gives them an answer right back with a little humor.  they laugh and laugh then on to the next ¡°hey alexa¡¯  can not wait to add on more products."
5213,1,it is alexa ! it is amazing and i love the color
5214,9,a family fun device!  even our 3 and 4 year old children love using alexa and playing music with ease!
5215,9,got for my in-laws christmas gift. they are hilarious leaning how to use alexa....often yelling at her louder than needed!
5216,14,we received this echo as a christmas gift but are unable to connect it to our wireless server account with a password that we are told is unrecognized when we use the password that is written on the outside of our receiver. what are we doing wrong? we are anxious to use this new device but have been unable to do so since christmas day.
5217,0,ok good but need to spend more money for more function.
5218,0,love this but it seems to have issues hearing me sometimes. wish it knew more
5219,14,"i ordered the 2nd gen echo a few weeks back and it works as advertised.  it was easy to set up and i have it connected through my amps to sets of external speakers.  the sound is outstanding.  with amazon prime, the number of songs is more than complete.  can not wait to buy a smart tv with amazon available for movies."
5220,10,i received the echo as a gift.  i love it.  it was easy to set up.  i have linked it to philips hue lights and a trane thermostat so far.  will be connecting the echo to a security system soon.  the speaker has great sound.  the voice control has been a lot of fun to use.  alexa has become our friend!
5221,10,love having alexa in the kitchen! music while cooking and cleaning up is great fun. also having the ability to add things to a shopping list while there is convenient.
5222,5,purchased as a gift.  my niece seems to love it so far.
5223,10,"i have a new friend, who keeps me posted on events and happy with music, and need to learn more of how to make her work for me."
5224,10,"i love how easy it is to use alexa. i can set reminders, set my alarms for school, and play music. setting it up & connecting it to my devices and spotify was simple. i love the alarms sounds!!thank you alexa."
5225,9,"bought three for office christmas party door prizes, was a big, big hit!!! fast shipping as expected from amazon."
5226,12,as read about and expected. still learning about features.
5227,5,bought as gift for my grandson in another state.  he loves it!
5228,1,love it good sounds and loves the amazon prime music.
5229,12,i amm still learning all the features but do like it alot.
5230,9,"so far so good! we linked with my son is echo dot so now we have our own ""intercom"" system instead of yelling to get his attention. :)"
5231,9,was purchased as a gift. enjoyed by entire family. great sound
5232,0,"love alexa, especially that she plays any song or artist you want."
5233,14,said it would connect with bose and my samsung tv but does not.
5234,9,"it is so convenient  to check the weather, news, traffic etc. asking random questions like ¡°what is a  frittata?¡±it is nice to find these things without screen time.  had mine for a week, and bought one for my parents.  my 85 year old dad will love it, as he still has a flip phone  :)"
5235,0,really love being able to listen to my music on such a small speaker that sounds great. like that i hardly ever have to repeat myself.
5236,0,"so far it has been great. we are still learning new things with it and hopefully it will be even better!! if i could suggest one thing, i think amazon music could be better. there have been music i ask the echo to play and it gives samples and not the music. this has happened quit a bit. maybe an expansion of different play lists, (country, jazz....)"
5237,10,"when i shop while shopping with my iphone, the items are gone.  they just have disappeared"
5238,5,wife got it for christmas.  very happy with it.  great quality and sound!
5239,10,it is a great device!!! you can ask alexa virtually anything.
5240,12,love this unit. all alexa functions plus great sound.
5241,9,so far loving this. just wish i could set upy fire stick to this.
5242,14,"what i like the most is the base tones from the woofer ,  amazing !  what i like the least is alexa goes off line several times a day, tells me to ""download the app"" ( which we have had since before she arrived !) while in another room,  little sister echo dot, smaller and much cheaper,  responds without fail !!"
5243,14,"what it is and what it is not.  this is essential,  for if you are an audiophile, this device is definitely not for you. really, how can anyone expect it all from a 3 1/2 by 6 inch cylinder.  if i want to simply listen to music, then i power up my big amp and bose speakers....and listen to music.  no, the echo is, for me, a device that plays music in a ""background mode"" for when i am doing other things - like reading - and do not want a totally quiet house. i have music on my tv through directv, but their programming is really bad and the tv has to be on. and you do not get to choose the selections.  so there it is....enjoy some nice music for a pittance or go to best buy and have the geek squad install sonic blasters.  your choice.  you will not get both for $99."
5244,10,"i am not very tech savvy, but this was easy to set up and start using. the sound quality is excellent! love the ease of playing any music from my amazon music."
5245,5,my husband bought this product and loves it as does my daughter
5246,5,very fast shipping great price works great wife loves it
5247,11,"sounds amazing! i love my dot, but the sound quality of the echo is 10x better."
5248,1,this is really a great product. very happy with purchase
5249,11,the sound from this 2nd generation echo is fantastic.
5250,0,"we enjoy this, mostly for music. she is not great at understanding what we are saying a lot of the time but repeating is not a big deal. sound is great."
5251,11,we like voice feature.....we had bought the prev version w tap/which was more difficult......
5252,1,really enjoying the echo.  good product and fun to use.
5253,14,it is a great little device. helps me with knowing the weather and traffic when i wake up. it is only a four star because i can not use my apple music with it but it is still a good speaker.
5254,14,easily installed. loses wi if connection frequently and then difficult to reconnect.
5255,12,really great sound from the echo...so far so good.
5256,14,"love the sound and ease of use once set-up.. being technologically challenged i did not find the directions for the set-up that easy but that is probably me!!! older user! we need carefully orchestrated step-by-step directions. other than that- love the portability of the device and the wonderful, continuous music you can obtain."
5257,11,"useful, almost has a personality.  tone, especially mid to high range, not great, lot of bass."
5258,14,this one do not hear as good as the amazon dot
5259,11,its good but only one disadvantage .. no aux audio input ... i think no body needs audio  out as much as audio in. .... think about it
5260,10,i love alexa. she keeps me company all day long.  she plays most music i ask for and answers many questions for me.
5261,12,it is fun. i do not get deeply involved with all it can do. like the music.
5262,0,"love it. good sound, and love the fact that we have unlimited music for $4 per month!"
5263,1,alexa works great and sound and volume are pretty great too.
5264,1,works wonderful works great with the other echo in my house
5265,9,i love alexa!! i use her to play music and control the lighting in my apartment and it works great! sound is amazing! i highly recommend getting one.
5266,10,i enjoy having the echo. it takes time to set up all the skills.
5267,10,"love it!!!! play music, search for things, purchase items all by speaking to alexa!"
5268,14,i love it is features and the music is the best a lot of my friends are hesitant to get onboard with alexia due to fears of people hacking and listening to conversations and gathering your information and i have to admit i understand after what i have read and heard with that being said i still love device and would love to be reassured myself
5269,10,very good for beginning ai.  can not wait for the future!
5270,14,this my first echo (second device) i have in my network. the 3 star rating is because this device will not display and therefore will not connect to the 5ghz wifi network. my first generation echo has no problem connecting to the 5ghz wifi network.
5271,14,everything was working fine until today all of a sudden it says i i am sorry i am having trouble please try again later! what the heck it is circle is red it does not turn the other colors the immediately turns red i am extremely frustrated with this. i asked it what it needed to be fixed it goes back to the same thing i am not working try again later
5272,0,fine sound and product. connecting to sources is more difficult than it has to be. comes with no instructionsother than what it can do...just not how to do it.
5273,1,great like the first echo. sound is great. great device.
5274,11,"great audio great item. a definite upgrade from,the dot"
5275,14,need a better ability to control bass and treble as may need in large open areas such as a garage or warehousea rechargeable unit will be great to place it in a central non electrical access area will be nice.
5276,4,love love love. very fun and informative. constantly learns.
5277,1,"it has a really good speaker system. i also like the size of the echo, it has a nice look and fits in well with any decor."
5278,14,sounds great. has trouble understanding you a third of the time. an audio-file may pick the speaker apart but any average joe or jane will think it is above average for the size.
5279,14,"love it!!  we check the weather with alexa each morning, and, as a prime member, have listened to a lot of music!  making a connection with my wifi was a little difficult, but after a few tries, connected fine and all is well.  used it during christmas dinner to play some christmas music while we ate.  for such a small item, the sound is amazing."
5280,11,sound is definitely better than an echo dot.  easily fills a room.
5281,12,i am just learning how to  do this with alexa  but its fun and very functional
5282,14,i received alexa as a gift. i had heard an seen advertisements about alexa but never put thought into it. after opening and following the easy instructions i am very impressed with everything she does.
5283,10,best present i have received...fun to teach it new ways to find things.  especially enjoy the music part!
5284,1,excellent quality and effective product; i love alexa services.
5285,9,"great sound,  awesome product,  so convent, have music in every room of the house now!"
5286,10,great sound....also has become my alarm clock
5287,12,"just love it.  fun, innovative.  i am pretty sure i am not taking advantage of all that it does, but it was a present."
5288,0,i love it..my husband is worried it is listening to everything..but it does not answer or respond unless you say alexa to wake it up...i use it daily
5289,12,woohoo - so much fun! i love to talk to alexa!
5290,11,echo makes my home. the speaker is amazing!!! super loud!!! alexa is smarts are greater than any other. also makes a great gift!!
5291,9,we love our echo! i bought one for my parents too and they said the best gift ever.
5292,1,excellent!! love the sound quality! love alexa!!
5293,11,"you need to own an echo, in every size, shape, and product."
5294,9,this is a gift from my daughter and so far have enjoyed it. looking into accessories.
5295,11,bass is off! sound quality is just terrible! how can this be an upgrade??
5296,14,echo was a gift from my children. i have not found any faults with it. this may be because i am only using 1/4 of it is full potential. it was simple to set up and get started. playing music is the feature i use most. i love the sound quality! it is simply the best. overall great product
5297,12,learning new ways to use it everyday
5298,1,works very well and is a lot of fun. alexa gets smarter every day.
5299,11,decent sound for the size of the echo. not to be compared to higher end speakers like the bose for far more money. enjoying the exho!
5300,14,for the most part i was very pleased with alexa. one thing that i did not like was that my kevo door lock  was listed as compatible with alexa. amazon definition  is just that alexa knows it is there when they make it sound you will be able to control you lock when actually  all it does is recognize it.that is not my definition of being compatible
5301,14,"echo arrived in the mail today in a large box. the package was rattling around in the box, absolutely no inflatable padding around it. be interesting to see how it operates after having been thrown around warehouses and trucks in the last couple of days."
5302,14,i have not fully explored my echo 2nd generation.so for pretty good.you learn something everyday  the  sound that come out of this little thing is awesome. i hope in the near future i get a chance to know my new friend better.
5303,13,absolutely love it !!  best invention since peanut butter
5304,1,great device to have .family is really enjoying alexa
5305,11,"sounds much bigger than it actually is,sounds great.well done."
5306,14,"never thought i would get one, but now that i have one its awesome!"
5307,1,like the cover. having a blast with alexa. super helpful.
5308,12,so far so good. no problems as of yet and still learning all the skills that alexa can do
5309,14,works nicely.  the sound is terrific and alexa picks up on everything that is said with almost never missing a request.  gave out several for the holidays.
5310,9,i love my echo so much!  my kids got dots for their bedrooms as well.
5311,14,the amazon echo is quite simply amazing. my whole family uses it for fun and for questions that we are really curious about. i ended up buying two more. the only thing i am bummed out about is that the first generation does not sync with the second generation
5312,9,amazing i love alexa ! i¡¯m so happy thanks amazon you¡¯re the best!
5313,10,"we have our echo in the kitchen, my wife loves to listen to music while she is cooking or cleaning. we use it mostly for music but need to learn more about the features."
5314,11,"great product, does work better than the dot."
5315,0,she is so smart she scares me.  she has only been wrong once about the weather.
5316,14,having lots off fun with the echo [2nd generation]
5317,5,i love my alexa  my daughter gave it to me
5318,1,love the new look the speaker is amazing. the ease of using this product. is outstanding.
5319,10,it is my second echo and i love it. now i can play music throughout the house!!
5320,14,"overall the product works well. i have had run-ins with alexa and her refusal to answer me. the first product i received had audio playback issues. the support team sent a better functioning unit after a troubleshooting call. the audio quality is good, not great. i have learned this works best when you have prime or a premium audio subscription service."
5321,10,"we love it!  asking questions, having music that we love!!"
5322,14,hooked this up for christmas and still having non stop fun with it.  a great feature is amazon music with amazon prime and connecting to sirius xm.  it controls lights and ac!
5323,11,absolutely love the echo. the sound of the speaker is great . really did not have any problems setting it up. this is a must have device.
5324,3,"works as advertised, nothing wrong with the product."
5325,10,"i love the echo. it helps us with shopping, recipes, google searches and so much more. i would highly recommend this device to everyone."
5326,11,not much better round than the dotcan not change the tone to more treble so it can understand speech better
5327,11,the sound is better than the the echo dot.
5328,14,works as described. set up was not difficult with downloaded application. mainly  bought it to play music throughout the house. only problem is i cannot play music in all rooms at the same time; have to pick which room to listen in. need to solve that to get to a 5 star.
5329,14,you know its great. especially now that it does sonos.
5330,14,"works very well. hard to set up as my amazon account is in canada but my prime account is in the us and to get music on the echo, it was a long set up and we needed amazon to help us."
5331,14,"it always misunderstands on first command, and sometimes it starts to talk in the middle of the night, and wakes everyone up.  i turned it off."
5332,10,provides great sound - use it in our basement which has become essentially our gym.
5333,9,honestly i love my alexa. she works great and has been helpful with small tasks that i usually have to find and use my phone for. she also controls the smart switches in the house. the kids yell at her endlessly to turn on the christmas tree right now... i ended up getting the dots for the kids and they love having them as well!
5334,11,"seems to be like the original echo, just a little smaller."
5335,9,love love love my echo! enjoyed it so much that i am now using them as gifts
5336,9,"it was a christmas gift. and what a gift. weather, music , news, games, help in the kitchen does it all. sound quality you cannot beat."
5337,4,easy to install.  works within minutes.  very pleased.
5338,14,"it answers all my questions about so many topics it is unbelievable. i think my wife is getting jealous it being a female voice. i took a picture of me and my echo and called it my family portrait and sent it to my wife at work. i do not  like the sleeping arrangements right now, lol"
5339,9,"i now have a personal relationship with alexia. i tell he ""good night"" and she responds with ""good night, i hope you had a nice day"" i think my wife may ge a little jealous.."
5340,14,it works great. they will not post any negative reviews so it works great. had i received it i am sure it would have.
5341,12,love this use it all the time so many things it can do
5342,9,"works great, i now have one upstairs and one downstairs."
5343,10,"still learning what tasks alexa will perform.  we like the daily briefing and the large selection of music, weather, a and lists of things to do."
5344,14,"eh, it is okay. speaker quality is good for music. alexa just sounds like such a robot. gives cool facts and directions with distance. turns off my light bulbs, but who cares about that."
5345,1,love this unit. very nice piece in the kitchen and easy to operate.
5346,14,did not get chance to play with it to much. lost it in house fire.
5347,11,great price and exceeds all expectations!!
5348,1,great household tool. especially the reminder functions. it is awesome! :)
5349,3,all that i thought it would be and more.  i love my gift.
5350,14,"took longer than i thought to set-up at home and then at work.  once it is set up, it is great.  i am sure (like microsoft word) i will never know all the functions or things echo can do."
5351,12,"it was a gift, still learning how to use it."
5352,10,"the echo has made our day to day internet searches interesting and listening to music so much easier. the sound quality is excellent and the ""question of the day"" is fun and educational. alexa responds quickly and her ""hearing"" is excellent , responding to requests from many areas of our home."
5353,11,"i already had a 1st gen echo, thought the 2nd gen would be better... it is not.  i am disappointed with things as simple as volume control."
5354,12,lots of fun and she knows music.  great new toy.  lots to still learn.
5355,11,very pleased ... sounds great connected to my bose speakers
5356,14,so far so good...alexa has been better than google home and apple siri in my experience....
5357,0,"my kids love it, and it provides some entertainment, but she often does not understand what we are saying or she will ignore our request.."
5358,9,amazing. i use this thing all the time and it has made life easier.
5359,14,i liked that the echo connected to my sonos system and now i can turn the sound up and down with voice command. i was bummed that i could not connect to my smart tv and it also is not convenient to have to keep googling how to connect things to it. came with no real instructions. other than that i do love it.
5360,14,i like the sound when you play music. very very nice. what i do not like is when i set a timer or a reminder it is not loud enough to hear i have to be paying attention to the lights. i was going to call and ask why it might be me. i also have a dot and i really love the dot
5361,9,we love our alexa.  bought 3 smaller ones too
5362,5,my son gave me this for christmas and i love it.
5363,1,a constant companion and source of information and entertainment.
5364,11,"i love the sound quality and the small design. it is just as good as the large, alexa. i would recommend."
5365,1,"great sounding speaker for it is size, a handy device overall."
5366,14,"update - so i am loving this now and updating to 5 stars. it makes a massive difference to how the music sounds spending on the source. i now have the echo linked to a spotify premium account and it sounds great in my bedroom. obviously not as amazing as my huge living room system but you can not expect that, the echo cost a tiny if fraction of that.  i am using many skills often now, like the sleep sounds for example with the sound of rain helping me drift off.initial thoughts, i was surprised that the music sounds pretty good in a small room. i mostly listen to music in the living room on my big speakers with google home mini connected to the receiver and google play. however the echo sounds good enough to listen to in the bedroom and i will use it for that going forward, the quality varies a lot by the music source though. when it says ""playing xxx from your library"" it sounds pretty good for a small speaker. i had bought echo to use with fire tv to control it using my voice but i am sending that back, that is another story but the new 4k fire tv is awful. as for using alexa, it is not bad at all and usually understands what i want., the voice does not sound as good as the google home mini. the alexa delivery is very robotic in comparison where the female google voice sounds friendly and a lot clearer to hear even comparing the bigger echo with the smaller google home.. maybe they will tweak the voice in the same way the echo has tweaked the music with software updates. by the way if do not know you can turn the microphone off on the echo it forces a software update that improves the music quality."
5367,10,i love my amazon echo! everyday i have the best conversations with alexa and she always listens and makes great requests. i¡¯ve found some neat playlists that i love to listen to on a daily basis now and she does so much more and if you take the time to research and go through skills that meet your personality she is great to have around!
5368,0,love it! easy to use. only problem is at times you need to repeat request to hear what was requested.
5369,14,"fun way to turn on radio,need a separate privacy button"
5370,14,awesome!
5371,9,love my echo. second one i¡¯ve purchased.
5372,13,the echo is so awesome! one of the best purchases i have made.
5373,12,"still learning my echo , so far i¡¯m loving it"
5374,0,i have a lot of echo is....i think i need help.
5375,14,"packaged well, instructions are simple and clear. app is easy to use to get advanced functions set up. bought it primarily for music playback...i¡¯m an audiophile so i¡¯m quite picky about sound so i had low expectations from such a small form factor and pricepoint. wow, huge surprise, this little thing reproduces great sound!"
5376,14,"the volume is okay. if other noise is in the house you will definitely have to turn it up to hear her. news topics could use an upgrade, generic news is okay, but it would be nice if there were a way for them to get more articles about your interests. perhaps it will expand over time."
5377,14,"being a huge nerd, i think this product is cool and fun to play with. i have not really found a practical purpose for it yet, but i do not live in a smart house yet so that is probable why. it is a fun toy though."
5378,4,arrived in good packaging.  set up easily.  very nice to have.
5379,12,"i love it! i am continually finding new things about this device. but, great purchase!!"
5380,14,sensational!! i have 5 of them throughout the house.
5381,1,works really well around the house.  great sounds when playing music.
5382,14,"looks like a cool, sturdy device but unfortunately, it cannot connect to school wifi so i am returning it (also, if you are a college student thinking ""this will not happen to me,"" think again<u+2013><u+2013>the echo logistically cannot connect to public, peer-to-peer, or ad-hoc servers)."
5383,1,this echo is great and the sound is awesome!!
5384,5,love! we received as a gift and enjoy alexa.
5385,14,"having the different color, cosmetic options was a good move. alexa fits right into the different rooms in my home. you do not even notice it unless you call on her and she speaks up. i love that!"
5386,9,love my echo. bought another one for our 2nd home.
5387,9,i¡¯m having so much fun with my new echo 2. learning new skills. 3 every day.
5388,10,"this is well worth the money. we use this all day ,every day. we use it to listen to music, help with my kids homework and to set reminders. theres so many things you can do with alexa. she is a part of our family now. :)"
5389,0,"we love alexa she is everything we thought she should be and do, our biggest problem is getting music through her. she can play what is on my i pad but we are not hooked up to a station yet. we are here in costa rica for 2 months then we will go back to florida and get it fixed .we love that she can translate to spanish for us."
5390,7,just loooove it! very helpful and entertaining :) highly recommend it to any person... it makes my life easier! thanks amazon <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+008a>
5391,14,"awesome product... kids play music flight day long,  nice sound loud"
5392,1,fun and plays beautiful music wonderful sound
5393,10,"i love my echo!  i originally bought it because my husband constantly steals my bose speaker.  now i can listen to music, have her send me recipes, give me the forecast, answer questions and order my amazon.  the only con is sometimes she is hard to stop on the games."
5394,14,i have only had it a short time but it is a delight. i am sure as i continue to use it i will find many more uses.  great fun.  thanks
5395,9,echo is great.  fun and useful. glad i purchased on sale.
5396,1,great addition to my home and my family love this item.
5397,14,"nice little device.  i do not have a smart house, but it is nice for playing music or getting information.  have not tried the phone feature yet."
5398,1,"love this device, the speaker is awesome."
5399,10,"i love alexa! she has become a part of the family!!! i almost can not live without her. i play games, get my daily weather forecast, and ask unlimited questions! she even predicted that my team the philadelphia eagles was going to win the super bowl and she was right! could not be happier! thanks, amazon!"
5400,1,great sound from such a compact unit. very happy so far.
5401,9,i love asking alexa questions. this is a must have for family is with children and also someone who lives alone.
5402,9,we love the echo and the great sound it produces
5403,14,not worth the money does not work with my mac
5404,14,"i rep,aced the bose soundwave radio in my bedroom with this."
5405,11,awesome connection and hears you very well. good sounding speaker
5406,10,what is not to love about an echo? it fits right i like a new family member lol
5407,4,very nice once you learn how to use it.
5408,0,"our alexa echo does not work well at all - you have to be right by her for her to understand you and she quite often - several times a day in fact - will say - ""i am sorry, i do not understand your request."" very frustrating!!!"
5409,12,love it.  still have lots to learn as to what it can do.
5410,10,alex is my favorite device and even sounds better now!
5411,14,"i ask alexa a question or ask her to play music, and she will start to respond and after about 5 seconds she kicks out.  this happens most of the time but not all.  i am sending her back for a refund."
5412,12,it does everything they say it well.  i truly impressed.
5413,14,all i¡¯m going to say <u+2014> you have to buy!
5414,11,this device has improved sound compared to the first generation product. i like the size of this device as it is portable and can fit in my bathroom and bedroom.
5415,0,a lot more convenient than i thought it would be
5416,10,"great product!  we play a lot of music, and the quality sound on this echo is really good.  such a helpful and enjoyable product to have in our home, we use it for multiple uses.  will not disappoint!"
5417,14,the sound is amazing and  true joy all this can do
5418,11,"love it, but i must say, the sound is not as good as my echo, 1st generation.  however, i love that it can hear me from another room which my 1st. generation echo could not.  so you must decide which is more important to you.  overall, i would recommend."
5419,14,very good and with the dot i was able to create a group
5420,0,we were most interested in getting it as a source of music variety. the sound is excellent. we have not tried to do much else yet but my husband is interested with the jeopardy function
5421,0,works pretty well and it is super convenient and helpful especially with your hands full. can have a hard time understanding certain words and requests. wish i could teach it any type of skill. not being able to play my music from soundcloud and having to use pandora sucks. also could be much louder music wise. definitely worth the buy tho.
5422,1,its really useful with amazing speaker quality perfect for blasting rob zombie
5423,5,"this was a christmas gift, so far i like it."
5424,10,love my echo!!!!!!  very clear sound and i can listen to whatever it want
5425,1,great product!  family loves it!  our second echo!
5426,10,the sound is great.  having lots of fun with alexa besides all the information we could want is at our finger tips!
5427,10,i love this girl! every morning she greets me with a ¡°smile¡± and every evening she ¡°tucks me in¡±.try question of the day. i¡¯m learning enough to try out for jeopardy! 5 golden stars
5428,14,"i really dislike the echo and can not wait to return it. about 1 out of every 7 times i say something, i get the result i want. and i am speaking very clearly and simply."
5429,10,"my music sounds very good on echo. i especially like the way alexa responds, almost immediately with whatever i need. if i mumble or she has no answer she tells me. surpasses expectations."
5430,14,have not even used it yet. i¡¯ve just opened my package to find no power cord included. very disappointed!edit: was shipped a charger free of charge and it arrive 1 days later! loving my new echo.
5431,10,love my echo it is helpful for me and the family helps kids with homework perfect reminders music and as we add more things to the house so much easier to answer the phone turn off lights while cooking cleaning and just getting stuff done without stopping what we¡¯re doing to talk on phone and much more
5432,0,"well alexa, once you figure out what skills you want her to have, is way better then siri and does so much more. its like having a butler (sort of). i love it."
5433,0,"i like the music playing function but am very disappointed that after several attempts i could not get it to recognize my voice. so i have not been able to utilize it for calls, messaging, calendar, etc."
5434,5,bought this as a gift for my momshe loves it!
5435,1,"use it for wrather, playing music and has a great sound!"
5436,10,as a prime member we enjoy streaming any music we want to hear.
5437,9,"alexa is great. she does amazing things. she has a ways to go, but in time, she will be my computer at home. we have 2 echo is. up and downstairs"
5438,9,my fifth one!  i have one in every room
5439,9,love it. bought as an addition to our alexia.
5440,14,loved the way was able to interface with my home audio system.
5441,9,"christmas gift for my husband.  he had an echo dot, but wanted an upgrade"
5442,10,we are really enjoying alexa. mostly for the music. we can listen to any artist any time we want to just by calling out a name.
5443,10,"i use my echo every day. i love to play pandora, ask her what is new, play jeopardy, etc."
5444,14,"yes, despite the fact that i live in brazil, it exceeded my expectations. the only thing that i¡¯d suggest is the possibility to set brazil as my living country. there are a lot of countries to choose in the app, mas brazil is not available. that means that i can not ask alexa about the weather forecast in my default location."
5445,10,i am addicted and so will you if you buy one.
5446,3,good price and exactly what i expected
5447,14,"got it from best buy !! love it it is very load fun setting up and control the lights, temperature and more, get free music for 30 days and pandora and more! also works really well with my tv (samsung) and dish (dish hopper)"
5448,8,excellent product.  my nephew love it.
5449,10,"not only did alexa give me the winner in the super bowl, she provides instant weather information, virtually any singer is play list. we have just begun to scratch the surface with what else this amazing machine can do but we are amazed every day."
5450,1,works great. great sound. we are very pleased.
5451,5,it is awesome.  my entire family loves it.
5452,14,"i am really really enjoying my echo. it has great sound and i have it play music while i work. alexa is very intuitive and even though i am an apple fan, she puts siri to shame. i might just have to buy another when they go on sale again."
5453,11,"pretty happy with this, will be buying more"
5454,11,"excellent sound, smaller footprint (height) easy volume controls on top"
5455,9,"loved so much, purchased one for my daughter as well."
5456,5,i gave it as a gift at christmas and feedback was that  it was great .
5457,1,"works amazing, is super cool, looks very attractive"
5458,10,awesome product! alexa is very helpful with alarms and reminders. and there is good speaker quality for music!
5459,1,"great sound, easy setup,  good price, like it allot."
5460,10,"i love it. the sound is so soothing to listen to, play is music like an expensive system does."
5461,5,it was given as a christmas gift but they loved it!!
5462,10,i love to ask alexa to play tom waits. once it suggested i choke my girlfriend. naughty alexa!
5463,12,still learning what it can do.  much fun!
5464,4,echo and alexa are a great combosound is acceptableeasy to set up and easy to use
5465,12,gift -- she appreciated it but not sure how it works
5466,9,i love it. sounds really great in my home. i have become so dependent in akexa. this is easily my favorite product
5467,14,"got a deal, glad we did! does everything the show does without the picture! nice sound"
5468,11,sound is great.  a little disappointed that it does not have the volume control by turning the top.  otherwise a great deal for the $79 i paid.
5469,7,well i¡¯m in love with alexa.  this echo is amazing <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0089>
5470,10,love this alexa.  she provides me with weather each day helps me with grocery list...music is great
5471,14,i purchased this for my father for christmas. he recently lost his wife and i wanted to have something there for safety make calls in case of emergency. (he will not do an alert band) this has been great for him as it also gives him ¡°somebody¡± to talk to at home.
5472,11,"i think it sounds just like my first echo, which is great!"
5473,9,family likes the item.  we think it is pretty cool.
5474,0,"we love it, i do not know what we did without her...lol!  i wish we could have one in every room."
5475,14,"the sound is incredible, fast responses, and it can hear your voice in with other noise going on"
5476,0,it is fine so far but i am having real trouble trying to connect it to my ipad and phone.  i am following instructions but it just does not work.  really frustrating.  i am sure everything else works fine but i got it mainly for this reason so it is disappointing.
5477,0,"love the choices of music and we are still finding new things.the only thing, when i asked alexa not to play any tunes by a certain musician she kept playing even more tunes by him. she does not know what do not or stop playing a name means."
5478,9,love the amazon echo. it is one of my favorite things
5479,12,love it!! what can i say its a great amazon product.
5480,1,alexa is so much fun and informative.
5481,1,i just love alexa. very entertaining!
5482,0,"apparently alexa can not find the weather for my location. i get i do not know that. if you ask alexa to play ac/dc, it can not do that simple task. i ask alexa to play music on spotify. so many things it does not know. still an infant i guess. may try the google device."
5483,14,the sound quality is excellent! much better than first generation. i wish you could create multiple zones and have a single echo as a part of different zones.
5484,3,"looks amazing,  sounds great,  recieved promptly"
5485,12,works well. still learning all it can do.
5486,12,"love it, but i am still getting used to the features."
5487,14,"good product!  looks good, high quality sound, immediate response, and as advertised.  lots of support and ideas as well as new stuff going on all the time.  did not give it the final star as it is early yet and we have not put it through the paces..."
5488,14,"good, not as loud as the first, but that is to be expected given its size, despite what amazon claims. still love it for the bedroom though."
5489,10,"my daughter and her siblings love it!  she uses it to play music, check weather, set her alarm, turn her bedside table light on and off, etc."
5490,9,recieved this as a gift for christmas and i love it.  the sound is great and overall very entertaining for my whole family.
5491,1,love alexa and love this echo. great sound and responsiveness
5492,10,best gift i have ever received! most impressive sound from such a small device...music comes thru just like stereo system.
5493,14,"i like many of the features. since i like listening to music, i do not like the fact you can not adjust any of eq ( bass, midrange, treble).  i find myself using less and less due to this problem  every person has a different preference on sound and this should be a feature with alexa. if it is a feature i just cannot find it"
5494,14,"the amazon echo is worth every penny ! happy i made the purchase and did not settle for a $100 alarm clock at pc richardson.  this speaker does everything you would expect from a speaker, and more with the alexa skills. a mmost buy product even if you bought for $99 or you happen to get on sale like i did."
5495,10,can get weather anytime. easy to set up. hard time connecting echo to echo for calls.
5496,3,product is as described and it arrived on time.
5497,10,"probably not using this product in all ways it is useful due to lack of knowledge, but will learn. enjoying the gift given by my daughter very much, especially the daily flash briefing and accessing whatever music i wish to listen to. i am about to learn how to use more of alexa is skills, looks like fun!"
5498,9,this was a gift. it came in on time and was packages very nicely! my dad also loves it so i do not see any complaints with it!
5499,0,"for simple questions, or for using it like a radio it is great. if you ask any kind of in-depth questions it will say ""sorry, i did not understand your question"". the app used for connecting the echo to the internet is very lame, and instructions are extremely vague almost to the point of being useless or of little help."
5500,3,"so far, so good. as expected. good sound."
5501,0,"good to play music that i bought on amazon, otherwise you have to pay for another program.that is basically all i use it for, because she does not usually know the answer to any other question that i ask. google is better"
5502,10,i have enjoyed playing with the echo. i plan on installing several items that can be controlled by the echo. my grand kids think the echo is a great and exciting playmate who sings and tells jokes.
5503,12,"cool unit, but still a work in process."
5504,11,"very happy so far.  music sound is much better than expected.  easy to setup, and to connect to a bluetooth sound bar as well.  still learning all of the features but works great so far.only downside is i wish amazon would have included a hard copy of explanation of what the different color rings mean."
5505,4,use everyday and more useful than expected
5506,11,after the last update sound improved. i like it now :)
5507,11,"everything that i expected (own 4 other echos) aside from the sound quality. it is a step up from previous echo but they made it out to be like it was a big jump in audio quality, which it is not."
5508,10,i got it for the ability to call someone for me.  i am still learning other things it can do.
5509,11,this is my 4th echo.  i love the 2nd generation.  smaller and more stylish than the original echo.  the sounds is amazing.
5510,9,my husband wanted to play music in his office but is technically challenged. with the echo he just tells it which songs he wants to hear.
5511,10,love it grand kids love it too they play jeopardy
5512,12,i love alexa  what more is there to say
5513,1,best sound systemin the house! and she is so polite :)
5514,14,"this was a gift for my 12 year old daughter. it is only used as a novelty, really, and it has not disappointed us yet. the sound quality of the speaker is amazing for such a small device. alexa is pretty helpful, and setting reminders and alarms is a piece of cake. i just wish it was not so expensive, so i could buy a second one for myself."
5515,3,love it.  enjoy it much much more than google home
5516,1,"it is perfect ! the sound is great for your living room,  the skills are great also!"
5517,9,i bought this for a gift for my mom and she can not stop talking about it or to it! she just loves alexa! she is really enjoying it.
5518,3,"arrived on time, good quality and as advertised."
5519,12,it was a gift so i really do not know. it looks cool!
5520,9,alexa and i are besties now!  i need to get one for my office too.
5521,14,a little hard d to set up at first.  may have been operator error?? but she is all set up and so much fun!
5522,0,"i like it. i am not using it to full potential, as i am not going to get prime just to use it more. that do not seem to smart to me. it is great for weather daily. hope it is not listening to all our house conversations. other then weather i do not see much use for it, as it is now."
5523,11,much better than it is predecessor.  sound quality is very nice.
5524,14,love love love the amazon echo generation 2 it is now my calendar my news i have been very happy with the amazon echo and as far as people believing it works for the cia well then i guess you better start living right no matter if you have an echo or not lol
5525,14,"rec would as a gift. love the sound. took a little effort to set up, but worth it."
5526,3,"exactly what our granddaughter asked for.  smaller than i thought it would be but apparently works just as described in a very competent, compact manner."
5527,11,great form.  sound is no better than 1st gen.
5528,5,i received this as a gift & i love it! great quality & sound.
5529,14,"first echo in the family. was expecting more based upon marketing. had technical issues for a good part of day after getting it connected. setup was confusing (i work in the tech industry). wish i could name it something of my choosing (bob). it is voice recognition could be improved. picks up well from a distance. sound quality is good. good, but wanting more."
5530,14,"update: i had set up my echo using my kindle fire. my kindle fire did not have all the updated software and apps it needed which made my echo buggy. just like when my batteries are low in the remote for my smart tv my tv starts to act glitchy. i change the batteries in the remote and my tv works perfectly again. whatever device you use to set up your echo (or alexa device) be sure the software and apps are fully updated. now it works as well as my tap and echo dot. simple fix and you would think amazon would suggest this!now the sound quality seems fine but i am not an audiophile nor would i expect bose quality sound out of this. if your echo is having trouble understanding you then use the feature to help it learn. the information provided about what this will and will not do is all available online so be sure you know what you are getting before you buy.first review had one star: have a 1st gen tap that i love and echo dot that works well. hate the new echo i received last week. hate it. 90% of the time she does not do what i ask. lights up and either does not respond, or tells me how to enable a skill that is already enabled. i walk into the other room and speak to my tap and she responds immediately with the correct request. why the hell does not my echo work the same way?? they are set up on the same account so i am baffled. i see they have discontinued the tap and i hate that. i am ready to send my echo back and buy a refurbished tap instead."
5531,0,"love alexa. takes a while to get her used to your voice but once she does, she can do so much"
5532,0,i really like the echo..it is simple and effective. you can ask any question or have it play any song and you get an immediate response. pretty neat product. would highly recommend !!!
5533,1,came quick.. great product. great sound
5534,11,"i would give a 2-star if they did not claim there is an improvement in the sound quality. i bought this one only because it is claimed so. the reality is really bad sound quality, really bad. i¡¯m returning it right now."
5535,3,wonderful product. i would gladly buy again!
5536,1,very pleased with the sound quality of the echo....
5537,14,"outstanding! especially voice calling capability provides seniors ""peace of mind"" during stressful or emergency situations."
5538,1,good sound with excellent listening quality.
5539,12,love it.  learning more about it everyday
5540,0,my kids and i love it. just wish it could be used without being plugged in.
5541,5,wife loves it!
5542,10,"nice device!  we are just learning all it can do for us, but currently use it to track amazon orders, play pandora & sirius xm, update us on weather and news in different cities.  it does tell funny jokes and gives answers to questions if you do not want to google a subject. it was a gift and we love it!"
5543,14,"great! since, i have bought fire tv and dropped verizon fios tv. i have also integrated my trane thermostat, ring doorbells and planning to do the same with the garage doors with it. awesome! i love automation and i am working on automating as much as my home, as possible."
5544,14,so much more impressed with echo compared to google home. thoroughly enjoying it.
5545,10,one of the best things i have ever had and with mobility issues is so easy to change music or just relax and let it play gets wrather and news too
5546,14,the echo does not work with fire 10 .
5547,0,it sounds good. it understands well. the only thing i did not like is that when you have it on volume 5 or above. it can not hear you tell it to turn down. you have to yell or manually turn it down. also i would like to name it myself. have a choice of female and male voices.
5548,0,"we love the new echo, my only complaint would be the restrictions with the way questions are asked, you really need to ask a question only one way for her to answer it. also lots of songs not available even though we have amazing prime. wish she would work with apple music"
5549,12,love it!  it is fun but there is a lot to learn
5550,12,this was a gift and it took us a while to figure how we can use it best for us. enjoying it so far!
5551,1,"the amazon echo has amazing sound, is extremely easy to use, and is absolutely wonderful.  we are definitely enjoying our purchase."
5552,9,love our alexa. our kids went one for their rooms.
5553,0,"i really like alexa.  she is great to talk too.  sometimes have a hard time getting her to do what want, but it all comes down to how you ask the question or what you want to know.  it is all in the wording."
5554,10,this thing is neat.  use it all the time. very handy for music and information while working around the house or in shop.
5555,10,"wonderful device. clean, and unique, small yet powerful. highly recommend."
5556,4,set up was easy. connected very quickly with no issues. so far so good!
5557,3,"very good, on time and as described"
5558,10,"i love that i can just ask for a certain genre and i get the music i want to listen to, along with weather updates, etc."
5559,10,"i really like to have music played while cooking or an everyday project. it was a gift that i really enjoy for music and a source for any information that is needed at that moment. it is the nearest thing to star trek is ""computer"" that captain  kirk would ask for any needed data."
5560,11,much better than the echo dot. great sound quality.
5561,11,it works as well as a dot but the speaker is terrible compared to the echoi want to return it
5562,11,i like it a lot i had the 1st generation and this one sounds a lot better with the bass. i would recommend this to anyone looking.
5563,3,does everything as advertised and great sound!
5564,14,simply amazing!!! what else i could say.
5565,9,everyone needs an echo in their house.
5566,12,"it is amazing works great , i been using it everyday"
5567,14,purchased 3 units for my house. liked the idea of music in each room. did not realize that is not possible. only let is you listen to music on one unit at a time. even though you pay full price for each unit.
5568,11,"sound quality is so much better than the original, wish my other 2 were the 2nd generation"
5569,1,love the devise and delivery was fast !!!
5570,14,i would have appreciated clearer step by step instruction on how to access amazon prime music and sync it up with echo.  i was able to achieve my  objective but it took it was a struggle with someone with my technical knowledge.
5571,9,"gift for wife, she is ecstatic.  selection of available music is nothing short of incredible."
5572,14,"i enjoy it in general. but the main attraction for me is being able to play music, and there are way too many things that are not available. sorry, but i am not going to shell out money for a premium music service to go on top of the price for amazon prime and amazon echo."
5573,0,i like asking alexa questions and getting great answers!
5574,9,alexa has been a nice addition to our home.
5575,14,the first echo was defective and could not connect to the internet. after a call another echo arrived and is working great. very good sound
5576,4,east to use and setup.  sound quality is great.
5577,1,this is my first amazon echo ever and i am very impressed. such a useful tool!
5578,14,the sound from this device is vert good. i¡¯ve yet to listen to all my favorite genres of music. however i know this smart speaker will hold up  to the test. sometimes the device seems to lag behind recognizing your voice. when it does just unplug it and the plug it in it connects to my network and we¡¯re good to go.
5579,9,"echo was a christmas gift to me from my son.  absolutely love alexa.  as i get to ""know"" her better, i will probably enjoy her even more."
5580,10,i love the second generation echo. the sound quality is excellent. i love that you can listen to audio books on it. i love all the music you cam listen to on it from amazon prime music. this device is great. i can say enough great things about it. i highly recommend getting one. it is a lot of fun.
5581,9,this has been perfect!  even my 3 year old talks to alexa :)
5582,11,works well using voice control.  still could use some improvement on sound level and quality.
5583,9,coolest device in decades.  should have got this last christmas
5584,0,"it was given to me for christmas. never thought of owning one, but i am surprised at what it can do! i do not need music on all the time, but it is nice to hear what i want to hear, and helpful for asking questions."
5585,14,sound is great. wish she was less mechanical in her diction.
5586,10,having music and answers to your questions at your instant disposal is great.  you can talk to alexia across the room and she hears well. great device.
5587,0,it works sometime
5588,2,this is a second alexa echo we love it would recommend it
5589,3,alexa worked perfectly and arrived on time.
5590,11,"love it, still getting used to my new friend, alexa."
5591,14,what needs to be said about this...these echo is are awesome in every way
5592,10,love it!  fun and practical at the same time. gives very quick accurate info.
5593,14,"there is some software installation, which is very easy. it is a fun and useful item to have around."
5594,5,absolutely love ours and bought another for a team contest!!
5595,14,"alexa has great hearing, she turns on the porch light when i ask from down stairs in a different room. she has a great selection of music"
5596,1,"its a lot of fun, and functions very well."
5597,9,easy to set up. nice speaker sound when playing music. already had the dot buteasy to set up. easy to use. good speaker sound when playing music. happy i bought it.
5598,1,simply amazing! sound quality and a microphone r phenomenal for such a small size.
5599,10,"has made my life much easier. and, the ambient sounds skill is such a help going to sleep."
5600,11,great speaker.  prefer the solid finish to the cloth ones.
5601,3,do not know how i ever lived without my alexa!!
5602,0,"it needs work, but i am learning its limitations."
5603,11,definitely the best echo in my opinion.
5604,5,it was a gift.  well received and appreciated.
5605,10,i love my echo.  the sound is very good.  the canister is unobtrusive and blends in with my room.  i enjoy experimenting with what alexa can do.  i recommend the echo
5606,13,this is the best thing since sliced bread. it is even better than i expected.
5607,14,"my echo 2 is awesome and exceeds all of my expectations.  not only is alexa smart beyond belief, i connected my home lighting system (phillips hue lights w/bridge) and my amazon fire tv to it.  choices and functionality of all 3 together is fantastic.  looking forward to what more it can do down the road."
5608,11,i like the new style and the sound is richer and deeper.
5609,0,"the echo has been really great so far. super convenient to find out information or play music just by asking it to. the only issue i have had is some times when i ask it to look up some information, the answer it gives me is completely unrelated."
5610,12,what is there not to love about alexa? nothing!
5611,11,sound is not as good as my echo 1 i do not know what they did to it
5612,10,i really like this. has a lot of info and music!!
5613,11,i love this device! the sound quality is absolutely amazing compared to the previous model and the dots. has low bass and good clarity. alexa still could use some help with stuff but that is to be expected. overall 9/10
5614,11,i absolutely love my new echo. i already had an echo dot but the echo has even better sound. i moved the dot to my bedroom and now have the echo in my living room.
5615,3,"this was a gift, but i have one as well and love it."
5616,11,great gadget. improved sound not that noticable.
5617,4,super easy set up and she is just full of information and entertainment. love!
5618,12,i am  very happy with the product  just have to use it a lot more than i have been  figuring out what it can say what i can not say  other than that i really like it a lot  thank you so much
5619,14,"sorry, star rating is just a place holder.  this was given as a gift and i have not gotten any feedback."
5620,14,"great buy, we can not get enough of alexa is help all day..."
5621,9,best gift i have bought my wife in quite a while. she added an dot
5622,5,bought this for my husband.  he has it in his office and uses it every day.  he loves it.
5623,10,the sound is wonderful! we use this every single day.
5624,0,what i do not like most is it does not go to google to find answers for you and you can ask for current things and she does not know the answer and i like music but i do not like paying for it through amazon and so i can get free music from the internet from youtube and other things so it is not as great as i thought it would be
5625,4,quick delivery and works nicely.  the sound is great.
5626,9,"i love it, but i bought it for my son, so now hopefully he will buy me one lol"
5627,11,"smaller, more compact but with much better sound!"
5628,1,great sound and gets my questions most of the time
5629,0,it is nice to be able to tell it to turn the radio on or ask a question. it sometimes has a mind of its own turns music on without being told to. it also makes phone calls occasionally by itself. i received this is a gift and glad i did not purchase it. if i have purchased it myself out of most definitely have returned it.
5630,11,sound is greatly improved over the original echo.
5631,0,it is pretty and it is accurate with the  weather. she often has a hard time understanding us
5632,0,i¡¯m still trying to program all my music. but i love it! i want a bunch more for the house!
5633,4,fantastic device. easy to set up.i plain love it!
5634,4,good pricenice product easy to usenice sound
5635,14,size and sound are good but i do not like the fact that you need to have it plugged in to use.  i have the original echo and bought the battery pack so i can us it anywhere without a plug.
5636,9,i can obtain all my news and music from this one device.
5637,5,bought as a gift for my daughter in law. she loves it
5638,11,the sound quality is not as good as i was hoping for.
5639,14,echo 2nd generation is an amazing help to me with my bad memory. a great addition to your home life for all.
5640,0,"we like alexa. it has great good features. the only reason i<u+fe0f> do not give it 5 starts is because we have to repeat very often what we want. for instance, ¡°alexa, can you play this song...?¡± we have to repeat a lot what we need in order to do it.in the other hand, she works great when she works."
5641,0,i love my echo. i listen to music all the time and just being able to ask what the weather is or time or setting timers is so easy. i love how many apps there are. the only thing i dislike is sometimes you just have to reword a question your asking for her to understand but that is not very difficult.
5642,14,full rich sounding speaker. very impressed with the quality of sound. connects to the internet and /or phone or tablet with ease. has a multitude of functions and i have not used them all yet. great buy!!!
5643,10,we love echo.  we probably do not need a radio for music anymore!  i love the daily affirmation and it is great to know the status of our amazon orders.  it is just plain fun to have around!
5644,9,this awesome!!  i love all the features and music shuffles as well as accessories for turning big on lights!  i recommend this to everyone especially if you have questions about anything!
5645,1,"good sound, good looks and easy to use. grest assistant!"
5646,0,it was a gift from married child. we enjoy the music.
5647,10,love being able to listen to music and ask guestion. what i do not like is that some times it comes on without a command. it kind of spooky when your home alone.
5648,0,"i think it is not all that, lots of times i ask questions and it does not know or even answer. but if i write the question on google, i get the answer"
5649,0,liked that it understands you easier when making a request
5650,10,i love it. the sound is really good and it can get really loud so we can hear it in other rooms.  my grandkids like to play with it and talk to alexa.  the draw back is the grandkids argue over whose turn it is to play with alexa.  hahaha!
5651,11,great bass response from the built in speaker.
5652,10,"its the greatest thing.  for people getting up in years. ask for remiinders , she does. ask for shopping list, she does. my husband and i really use her a lot.  she reminds us of our drs appointments."
5653,10,"alexa is my amazing personal assistant. she reads me books, tells me stories and jokes, makes shopping and to-do list and even tells me what the weather is and what i have on my calendar. not sure how i lived without her. :-)"
5654,10,i love playing games and listening to music.
5655,1,"works, looks and sounds great! very pleased!"
5656,14,"really like it. sound quality is great. frustrating to learn alex is ""language"". for example she does not understand open netflix. you have to say start netflix."
5657,11,just smaller. i have not notice much difference.
5658,12,having fun using alexa.  i am learning with her.
5659,0,"nice, but there is a learning curve on how to address alexa to get your desired results"
5660,3,it works but itis very context stringent
5661,1,great product and it looks good too!
5662,9,bought 3 as christmas presents... all work great!
5663,2,i love it ..is like to havae a second wife..h ah ah
5664,2,love love love!  i hve purchased 2 of these!
5665,14,bc i¡¯m away from home i can only use it from my hotspot. it works very well but i¡¯m sure i¡¯ll use it much more with my home wifi connection.
5666,3,just as described and the order was processed promptly!
5667,9,alexa is so much fun. sound quality is amazing. set up is super easy. i liked it so much i bought the echo dot as well
5668,9,i like it and the echo is very easy to set up and fun to learn all that it can do. the sound is very good. i¡¯m glad i bought the echo. thanks amazon.
5669,0,sound is good.  it does a lot of things i did not expect.  you need to spend time looking through all of the 'skills' to get the max out of it but it is fun.  a little hard to set up.  wish there was a live person you could talk to text on-line with.  i finally reset it and now it is working but wasted a day.
5670,11,a great improvement to an already great product!
5671,0,good so far but some of her answers are not related to question
5672,7,awesome<u+2022>._.<u+2022>'<u+00af>`<u+2022>._.<u+2022>'<u+00af>`<u+2022>.p<u+2022>e<u+2022>r<u+2022>f<u+2022>e<u+2022>c<u+2022>t<u+2022>-:|:-s<u+2022>e<u+2022>ll<u+2022>e<u+2022>r.<u+2022>'<u+00af>`<u+2022>._.<u+2022>'<u+00af>`<u+2022>._.<u+2022>thx
5673,14,my wife loves it i also purchased the dot which i like but then purchased the tp-link smart wifi lug and had problems trying to set it up now they want $7.00 on a $29.00 purchase to send it back so i¡¯m stuck with it.
5674,14,absolutely love it. i use it all the time. for everything from weather to music and wake up alarms. the sound is incredibly. i really did not think it would sound so well at higher volumes.
5675,14,"i was one of the first to receive the echo first gen, and could not wait for the second gen release mainly because of the heavily promoted sound quality, so i preordered the 2nd gen model too. however, so far i am unimpressed with the sound quality. the sound is a bit tinny, the base needs to be pumped up. alexa seems slow to respond to my commands too, there is a slight delay in her response that i never noticed before on the 1st gen device.  at this point i do not see any reason to ¡°upgrade¡± to this 2nd gen  mode. i would have gladly paid $50 more for a really upgraded product.unfortunately, i am sending this unit back and will keep my 1st gen. as my primary echo.  i will wait until they really design and release a truly upgraded generationon the + side, the design is beautiful, the fabric sleeve is really well made and gives off warm homey look as compared to the flat black hard case of the previous generation"
5676,10,the echo is fun -- works great --  i get updates - news  - weather - music - recipe recommendations  etc  ---  i use it more than i ever thought i would.  it was a gift ---  extra points for my daughter!  a perfect gift for you or someone you  love it!
5677,11,it is a nice device but the music sounds better on my bluetooth speakers
5678,10,bought this for my wife for christmas and she loves it. i have amazon music which puts nearly every song written at her disposal. the speaker is loud enough for our living room and you can still vibe in the kitchen. my daughter is 3 and is obsessed with it playing silly things lol....
5679,9,alexa is very handy for quick info wherever you are in the house. the speaker quality is very good for listening to music. i have had echo for two weeks and so far it is always on without interruption as long as my wifi is active. it was wasy to install and setup. it was a gift to my wife and she loved it.
5680,1,love it! my family has so much fun with it
5681,1,very pleased. sound quality is great.
5682,5,bought for daughter for xmas and she loves it
5683,5,bought this for my mom. she loves it.
5684,10,love my echo. i use it as a timer and to play games.
5685,14,i have the amazon show in my bedroom and this echo plus is on my desk. it is been an invaluable asset for my business as well as in my personal use.
5686,10,"excellent excellent excellent, love it , having a  great learning experience with alexander. always something new to learn. new daily facts, jokes, etc. it is awesome !!"
5687,0,"does not understand anyone in the house more than 30% of what it is asked, it is very frustrating. i have even tried relocating it, enunciating or speaking slowly and it still is very poor at doing what it is asked. the speaker is nice and when it works its cool but i would not buy another one."
5688,9,"this was a gift for my fiancee, everyone loves it. he uses it as an alarm in the morning, to find different  songs he likes, and the grandkids think it is  funny when they ask it to fart.  it is loved by all."
5689,14,"i am a regular listener to the internet-radio trop-rock station radio a1a ...using my echo and the tunein app, i no longer need to tie up my smartphone :)"
5690,10,"absolutely love my echo! i am now looking to buy ""smart"" products for my house to link everything in."
5691,14,"the new amazon echo is definitely better than the last model. more receptive when theres noise and plays loud and clear. i just feel like the amazon music unlimited works as well on this one. there is songs that i would ask to play on the old one that do not play on this model. besides that, does everything i want!"
5692,10,i really enjoy this echo to listen to music/
5693,14,"sounds ok, but alexa has low i.q. as far as music choice."
5694,1,great sound and has all of the amazing echo benefits
5695,9,my third echo purchase -- love them!
5696,11,"as far as sound quality, definitely a huge upgrade from the echo dot."
5697,11,sound is slightly better than original echo.  size and availability to choose color and material is great.  the walnut blends much better with the location chosen for it.
5698,9,"i love this product.  we ended up purchasing 4 for gifts and another 7 for ourselves, including dots & shows."
5699,14,"a fun toy.  with a special plug, she magically turned our rotating christmas tree on and off at command. corny jokes. weather. spelling. some things she does not know."
5700,10,"it has great sound, and i love being able to listen to all kinds of music, whatever my mood.  it also acts as a handy weather info source, and a timer.  the jokes are pretty corny."
5701,0,it is convenient but it does not always have the answer i need.
5702,10,"i live this device, it is like i have my own personal assistant to help me with my business and everyday need to do activities. not to mention that lights and other things around the home are activated without lifting a finger."
5703,1,"i am very pleased with the echo, the sound is very good also."
5704,11,excellent sound quality even at high volume
5705,14,"the echo itself is brilliant. however, some third party apps like harmony hub are a pain to work with. the app sometimes work and most times does not. if you want your echo for a specific task do your research first before buying one - though at 99 bucks this thing is a bargain..."
5706,14,needs to be smarter over all a novelty
5707,9,"love it so far, ordered a dot and am about to order another dot."
5708,0,we really enjoy it. there is quite a bit she does not understand. sometimes that is frustrating. we love how it turns on and off the lights on schedule.
5709,10,"this is a  great  device! i use it for everything, music ,whether and dropping in on friends"
5710,7,something i would not buy for myself but got as a gift. now i wonder why i did not buy it<f0><u+009f><u+00a4><u+0094><f0><u+009f><u+00a4><u+0094>
5711,0,"sounds ok, does not know very much, ask it simple questions, ""hmm, i do not know that one"". voice recognition lacking. if i had to do it over again, i would get google home."
5712,0,"works as advertised but sometimes it does not know what we are asking--still, it is fun to use and we are glad we purchased it."
5713,11,o love the speaker. for a small one has excellent sound. wish the dog had better sound
5714,0,"excellent sound compared to the echo dot. we use it like a radio. so nice to just use voice commands. we might say, ""echo, play neil diamond songs. no problem at all. very glad we purchased it."
5715,14,exactly as described!  my family loves alexa!
5716,14,i love this thing. sound is really good. a lot louder than i expected. i have a 1st gen eu-boom and this is much louder than that. more than enough for a desktop/counter/patio speaker. will be picking up a few more of these for other rooms.
5717,14,"needs to be low latency capable, then i would rate higher."
5718,9,nice addition to our echo family. sounds really good but not quite as good as her big sister.
5719,9,awesome.  got two people wanting to get one
5720,10,loving alexa!  she keeps us up to date on everything!
5721,14,really think the evho 2nd gen is the best.  she has already discovered common things i do and suggests appropriate alternatives just to keep the conversation interesting.  seriously recommend.
5722,11,it looks nice but does not sound as good as the original echo.
5723,14,"this thing never worked, tried to email amazon they never got back to me, waste of money and time.  tried everything in the instructions multiple times and still nothing....  junk"
5724,10,was very unsure about this product going in to it. now i love it!
5725,14,it is ok .  the same as the dot. just cost more for the unlimited music .
5726,4,"love it...great sound, easy to install!"
5727,11,love this.....had originally bought a 1st generation but am so glad i returned it for this one.
5728,1,most enjoyable electronic device yet!
5729,3,"works great, much better sound"
5730,9,love my echo i have 2 the sound is wonderful and i love them..
5731,14,"malfunctioned, out of the box. 2 hours with very helpful tech support concluding the unit was faulty. the units seem to be hit or miss...why?"
5732,12,this is the greatest. so far so good
5733,9,"bought one, love it, purchased another for other room."
5734,2,absolutely love it.  beyond my expectations
5735,11,i really like the size and look.  the 2nd generation echo is shorter that than the 1st and it has such a nice look now too.  the sound is awesome!  i use it so much for music and i am very happy with it.
5736,12,sounds great and works just like it is supposed to!
5737,12,"works well, would love to explore more i can do with automation for home devices."
5738,10,"the entire family loves the echo! the music, the games, the stories, information, timers... the list goes on and on!"
5739,0,"i love this echo, i am having fun with it, i need to figure out more of its features.  the only downsize is it is not wireless, it would be nice to be able to move it wherever you want to without having to plug it in."
5740,0,she/ it never knows answers to simple questions as a matter of fact does not answer any questions. the answer is always i do not know. very disappointed.
5741,3,alexa does not know everything. she works fine.
5742,9,awesome piece of electronicit is like having a roommatei got it for christmas from my brotheri love the huge variety of millions of songs you can heari mostly use my echo for musicwhat i do wish is that the speaker would be more bassy and powerful
5743,14,"nice voice. music sounds good. since i am a prime member, not sure why echo subscribed to music at an additional charge."
5744,9,looooove these.  use all the time. sound great
5745,0,most fun i have had with my clothes on in years.
5746,14,"somewhat limited without a smartphone and, therefore, the ap."
5747,14,"seriously considering returning it and buying google home. the voice recognition sucks. you have to repeat yourself so many times. the ""skills"" are not good and you need prime to either stream music or have to pro or top tier version of spotify. i am completely unsatisfied and unimpressed with this purchase."
5748,9,i got the echo dot as a christmas present and loved it. after using and learning the dot for a week i decided to get the echo for its great sound quality. now it runs the downstairs of my home.
5749,1,great speaker system . i love it
5750,1,the echo is lots of fun and works well we¡¯re are enjoying echo.
5751,1,pretty cool devise sounds good too
5752,9,i love this girl! love it for the music selection as well.
5753,4,amazing device and easy to set up
5754,0,"i enjoy using alexa very much, when i ask her to play music, the sound is so clear and balanced. i have not used alexa to order items yet but i¡¯m looking forward to trying it out."
5755,4,very nice works great a lot of steps to set it up
5756,0,had trouble recognizing certain words.
5757,10,i love it it gives me my notifications sends my shopping list adds to my calendar and plays music and so much more
5758,14,"""computer, turn off my lights"" ""ok""i have also gotten it to feed my cats. now if only i could get it to do my laundry and cook for me."
5759,1,great price and fast shipping
5760,10,"we love our echo.  alexa is always ready to play our music, give us a weather report or answer just about any questions that we may have."
5761,10,love this device. kids love asking questions and playing games.
5762,10,"received as a christmas gift. lots of fun, and i love the music she brings to me via pandora."
5763,10,i love the echo! i¡¯m still learning how alexa responds to certain commands. love the shopping list. playing jeopardy as well
5764,0,"works great, very sensitive picking up my voice and requests even when i am not near it."
5765,0,"good sound and plays pretty much what you ask for.  we have asked some jeopardy questions which seemed to confuse alexa.  it is a cool toy,  but truthfully, i can use pandora for my music, google to look stuff up and the timer on the stove instead of setting the timer on alexa."
5766,14,"i love this echo because of the sound, our echo dot stopped connecting to bluetooth speakers.  so this does not need to connect to another speaker since the sound it great."
5767,10,"such fun. great being able to just ask for music, weather, or information. allows you to play music and pause when you need to. does so much more. i am just learning all things she/it can do. i want one in every room!"
5768,12,i have not used it enough to see the advantage of this device.
5769,9,love love love...it will even sing happy birthday... so fun
5770,9,i bought this for my wife for christmas and we love it! we purchase the hue light kit and bulbs and can control all our lights with just our voice.
5771,14,"i can only write a review on the music playing and game playing capabilities of the echo. so far, we are super impressed, for the most part and that is only because of the catalog of music. some of our favorites bands it knows and some it does not. the ones that it does know, the sound quality is excellent!!"
5772,9,"love it!looks good and works great. i am very pleased with it. it has good sound, and good voice command response. my kids love getting alexa to tell them jokes, and i love playing music from it."
5773,7,it is alright but sometimes unresponsive which is pretty pathetic given the fact i spent $100 on it <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0095>
5774,0,i like the concept. takes some time to figure out just how to talk to the echo. get a little better each time i use it.
5775,1,"great idea, lots of fun, great speakers."
5776,11,i have now purchased about 7 echos(dots and towers). i know that the dolby sound is considered an upgrade in this unit. but it sounds tinny and confined in sound size vs 1st gen.
5777,5,"it was a gift , and they love it."
5778,9,my husband is obsessed with this!
5779,3,love this! how did i live without it???
5780,1,"the sound is really good, and it looks great."
5781,0,"nice unit, needs more instructions, difficult to activate."
5782,14,these products just keep getting better
5783,11,same good entertainment but i do not use it as much as the dot because the speaker is muffled.
5784,12,it works.there is nothing that i dislike.
5785,0,enjoying for most part... still have to google to get 30% of questions i posed!!
5786,1,the response to our inquiries has been informative and quick.
5787,1,excellent sound quality and looks really nice! love it!
5788,9,one of my favorite things that i¡¯ve ever bought from amazon!!!!
5789,1,"totally surprised at the sound quality.  amazingly loud, clear, and rich.  also fits and looks great in addition to the other features, such as ""alexa wake me at 6am"""
5790,5,got it for a friend and he loves it!
5791,3,item as described would buy from this seller again.
5792,4,excellent gift. easy to install and easy to sync. highly recommend!
5793,10,this echo does a lot of neat things.  have not fully explored all the options yet.  it is in our vacation home and provides the opportunity to keep and eye on things.
5794,14,received it as a christmas gift. well constructed and easy to install but it mainly sits unused since i would not have purchased one for myself. use it occasionally to play songs from my iphone via the bluetooth link. eventually i may find meaningful stuff for it to do but right now my life flow does not need it.
5795,14,the product does not work i called to get installation help and was told that i need to get internet protection. did this and it still will not work. i was very very disappointed in this product. tried to return was told item was too old and did not qualify for a refund.
5796,5,well received as a christmas present.
5797,0,it would be a lot better if i could figure out how to work it
5798,0,"it does what is says it will do and i am sure more, i am excited to see what they will come out with next"
5799,7,"love it better than the first generation, <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0086><f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0086><f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0086>"
5800,1,very happy with this product
5801,11,not as good as the first gen
5802,11,love the new speakers and the walnut wood grain looks great in the kitchen.
5803,14,i like that there are other ¡°wake¡± words for those who can not pronounce ¡°alexa¡±had a few odd moments when echo would say it could not find/do/call when only thing that was on was the tv and ¡°wake up¡± name was not used.
5804,10,"i received this as a gift. i use it daily for music, the timer, and getting information."
5805,11,it is great but the sound quality could be better
5806,4,sound is great. easy to setup
5807,14,bought 3. they work great. the volume on them is a range 1-10. i would not recommend listening over 6 unless there is no bass.
5808,11,awesome product! great sound and sleek appearance. going to order 2 more!
5809,3,works as expected no issues.
5810,0,"it is nice and can do a lot of things...and it is certainly convenient vs. getting on google to look it up.  but have also been a little disappointed with some of the stuff where i get back a ""do not have that information"" response."
5811,14,it was very easy to set up. hardest part was figuring out what skills to activate. it is still a work in progress on that area. i got a tp link plug to work my living room light. these were christmas presents. i only wish i could work my tivo with alexa.
5812,11,"added base to improve sound kind of muffles the sound, but still a great novelty."
5813,8,"great product, it works great love it."
5814,3,"would do business with again, gr8 vendor wonderful product"
5815,14,"it works surprisingly well, at least for what i have need for at this time. as i add home automation and other devices, i will get even more use out of it."
5816,5,this was a perfect gift for my mother..
5817,14,i like it but it is not ready to handle all the verbal questions on the internet like a tablet or phone can if you are typing.
5818,14,"liked improved sound, wish the plug was smaller to fit next to other items in plug next to it. it does not fit in the outdoor style plug on my patio with flip cover, it is too big. lucky i have another on the ceiling nearby.... not as convienent though."
5819,9,"love, love, love, what can i say i have two!"
5820,14,we have two of them and they have a pretty decent  sound.
5821,11,i like the smaller size and it works great.
5822,10,"my husband bought me this as a surprise and i was a little leery at first about it but to my surprise it does a lot if you actually take the time to look through the app, set things up etc. i think my favorite part is that i can set reminders and alexa will let me know throughout the day for whatever time i set it for."
5823,4,"works great, easy to connect to wifi and speaker sounds really good."
5824,3,great product - sound is much better than ver1
5825,12,we use it all the time love it
5826,12,what a fun thing to have around!
5827,14,got this on a black friday sale and we love it. if you are not looking for bose sound quality you will not be let down. you get a great bang for your buck with this.
5828,12,great still learning how to use.
5829,10,"we like the ""add vitamins to the shopping list"" and then have the list sent to the smart phone.  plus alexa is sweet singing voice.  she sang happy birthday to our 16 year old granddaughter. plus many other things: weather report, answers almost every question within her knowledge base."
5830,12,excellent but kinda tricky to use! just gotta play with it but great sound and device.
5831,1,the music is great!!! such a smart personal assistant.
5832,4,easy to install and a great little information source.
5833,10,i really enjoy being able to listen to the music i like.
5834,4,was easy to set up...and sounds better than my 1st echo
5835,4,its ease of use after simple setup make it fun to use.
5836,0,"i love her she is very funny. i wish she knew more. i am excited to see what updates she has in the future. she says ""i do not know that"" a lot. that is why she does not have five stars. the sound quality of the music is amazing."
5837,10,kids and i love alexa like part of the family
5838,14,has more of a bass tone to it. if you have two name one echo and the other alexa
5839,1,love having the echo in the house.
5840,0,"i love the convenience. it is like having a library sitting on the table next to me. the thing i like the least is that there are quite a few questions i asked that it does not know, and i have to go look it up on the internet.  i¡¯m sure in time that more knowledge  will be integrated into the system."
5841,11,sound is much better than the dot!
5842,14,2nd gen ftw. this is greatly improved over the first one.  amazon still needs to write some code to make me get up and push a volume button to turn the alarm off though. too easy to yell at it. #lateforwork
5843,14,being used in our mult system. works well
5844,14,have 5 echo in my house-all great
5845,9,after getting this i have become obsessed!
5846,14,"the sound quality is as good as other reviewers said. so, far i have not done much more than listen to music but i¡¯m happy so far. i probably would not have bought one myself but this was a gift. i¡¯ve found alexa is one more thing i did not know i needed!"
5847,2,i love love love my echo. wonderful product thanks amazon!
5848,10,the sound from echo is excellent.  music from amazon fits my needs very well and alexa retrieves as requested without hesitation.  we are learning as we use alexa.  one area that alexa does not seem to have information is exercises for certain areas of the body...such as alexa provide me weight bearing exercises and no answers??
5849,14,alexa is now in charge of the household.
5850,10,love it for both music and information requests.
5851,5,"christmas gift for my youngest son, he loves it!"
5852,1,very good sound and range.  worth the price.
5853,10,"has made everything easier.  i use it for reminders, calls, and music"
5854,9,works great in our bedroom.
5855,14,it is working as it was intended.  the sound quality is good however the compatibility with other devices is just okay.
5856,11,it is slower?also i prefer the original two manual volume options.new model only has one.
5857,14,i liked it. did mostly as advertised. i did have difficulty setting up the wemo app.  had to set wemo on a smart phone 1st then pair it with alexa.  otherwise very satisfied.
5858,14,alexa is pretty smart on most things. thanks.
5859,1,amazingly quick reponses. fun.
5860,10,"my husband loves alexa; while he is doing business and has his hands full, he tells alexa to either look things up or to play his favorite music!"
5861,1,very happy with alexa and the sound is great.
5862,10,"enjoying the new echo, i wish i could ""hook"" up all my echo is so i could play the same music, from pandora, cd is throughout the house. i also wish i had instructions for usage, along with a list of things that my echo is can do .please remember not every is really familiar with its usage."
5863,1,very pleased with this purchase
5864,10,"bought for my wife for christmas. nice sound. she loves the fact that you can alexa to play any type of music, any artist, any genre, any year and she lways finds the songs. we also have an echo dot in my office. so we use it as an intercom. a+++++"
5865,14,"i am very unhappy!!! i have been a prime member for so long, i purchased this because i love the way it works and the concept. unfortunately the unlimited music family plan does not let me add or delete members. besides i can not add members that does not have an amazing account, that is ridiculous if my family is my husband and kids! why do they need an amazon account beside mine? it is my family, and we all have one account we do not need more."
5866,9,i love this thing! everyone who sees it wants one. get one for yourself today.
5867,14,got it for the radio function and between the prime music and echo it is great.
5868,10,"i am very happy with the echo. i use it primarily for news, weather and music."
5869,3,"i think it has really great sound, and performs wonderful."
5870,4,very easy to set up and use
5871,14,"unfortunately i am unable to compare to the 1st generation as i do not have one but i have to say the sound from the 2nd generation, whether at low or high volumes is very good indeed. in fact, it far exceeded my expectations & i do not say that about many things."
5872,11,"this is awesome! the price, size, and design are all on point and have been greatly improved. music quality is amazing. alexa commands are seemless but improvements can still be made with her understanding what you are saying. works great and highly recommend without a doubt!"
5873,9,"my wife absolutely loves her new echo! she was not sure if she wanted it, and how much she would like it at first, but it is her favorite gadget around the house now. the sound quality from this thing is amazing considering it is size."
5874,11,the bass is much improved compared to my dot
5875,0,it is fun and interesting. has difficulty with understanding some speech but works most of the time.
5876,11,small form factor. great sound. great sale price. all good...
5877,11,this is an excellent device. definitely worth the money and priced just right. the new covers are a perfect touch for an exceptional device
5878,12,works as it is supposed to.
5879,5,gave it as a gift she likes it.
5880,10,love this!!! easy set up and very happy with the product!!! we have gotten a lot of use with it. my husband loves listening to music with the echo.
5881,14,"it is exactly what you think.  i wish there were more options for renaming, my kids are constantly hollering for 'alexa' and countermanding each other is commands.  they have learned all the other names as well.  i know it is always listening, but that is not as much of a concern for us as perhaps others."
5882,10,"i actually received this as a gift, so i had no preconceived expectations. presently our home is not fully smart so we really just use this for music and games.  we do have relatives and like the drop in function we all use together."
5883,9,this is my second echo also have a echo show. we use this one in the bedroom and it works just great to play music. speakers are good considering how small they are. just remember it is not a stereo so do not expect that type of sound.
5884,14,this is awful. we are either returning it or selling it. it will not stay connected to the internet and just out right is not at all what it could and should be. we have an ihome and it is ten times better. at least it never stops working all the time. had for two days now and is not working more then working. buyer beware
5885,1,love it!!! sound is perfect!
5886,1,great sound quality and technology.
5887,1,enjoying the ease of using this
5888,3,with little work everything worked fine.
5889,9,for an old foggy this is more of a toy.
5890,5,it was a gift.  she loves it.
5891,0,"love having music without having to sync my phone. does not know everything, but you can always try!"
5892,5,this was a gift for my daughter.  we absolutely love it.  great purchase.
5893,14,i have not even touched the surface with the things it can do but so far i love it! i love that i can just ask it something from almost anywhere and it is done. i do not have to go and turn knobs or push buttons. i do not have to get out of the bath to change the volume or channel or to turn it on!
5894,11,"i do not like it nearly as much as the 1st generation.  it does not pick up commands very well-we are constantly having to repeat ourselves.  i also miss the volume wheel, i do not like having to push the volume buttons on top.  wish i had just ordered another 1st gen."
5895,14,"updated - amazon is advice to disconnect my pandora account and then reconnect it worked to resolve the problem with alexa not finding my stations. if they fix the grouping problem i will upgrade my review to 5 stars. i really like this little player!updated - someone from amazon actually called me to discuss my concerns about making groups! he was also able to help me  troubleshoot the other problems. now that is fantastic service! i am going to add another star to my review because it seems like they are really trying to give me what i want. if i can resolve all my problems with their help i will come back and adjust the stars accordingly. thanks amazon!prior review, two stars:  overall i kind of like these. i started off with the google version but switched due to alexa having more functionality. there are three problems i have discovered on this journey. first, unlike the google equivalent, alexa randomly disconnects and stops streaming my music frequently. i have to restart play to my ""upstairs group"" 10-20 times per day. it does start playing again right away though. the second and more annoying problem is that when making groups each device can only be in one group! this is a huge problem if i sometimes want to play to the whole house (6 echo devices) say during a party vs if i only want it to play in the kitchen and office so i do not disturb other household members. sure i can play them individually but with the rooms so close together i can hear both sources at the same time which does not work for me. finally, alexa can almost never find my pre-trained pandora stations no matter how clearly and exactly i enunciate so most of the time i have to start playing from the app to get the correct station."
5896,11,great sound. i do not love the fact these the new echos are not portable like the tap.
5897,5,best self indulgent purchase ever made. it is so much fun.
5898,0,very cool. there are a lot af i can not answer that. all in all still cool.
5899,0,"wish it would come with more directions, not have to go online to find."
5900,14,sounds great!  considering how small and inexpensive this speaker is the sound is incredible.  i used to work for dolby and i know for a fact that a lot of work and technology went into making this product.  very well done.
5901,3,"great product, works as advertised. would buy again."
5902,5,"this was a gift for my daughter, she loves it."
5903,0,received the echo as a gift. like it a lot. just disappointed that it is not wireless. now have to spend money to buy a wireless base.
5904,11,a great upgrade to the first generation echo. better sound.
5905,1,"great product, great sound quality especially for the size, got a great deal on it !"
5906,10,"we have been enjoying it, although i am sure we are underutilizing it -- love the option to have alexa add items to my grocery list!"
5907,14,sound quality is great and was able to port my pandora account easily to it and the music sounds terrific.
5908,0,can not answer a lot of questions but play nice music
5909,14,so here is the problem with this. you will get this and want to replace all the dots in your house with this. the sound is spectacular.
5910,2,this is my second one...love it!
5911,1,its very sensitive and the sound is great
5912,2,i love my alexa! and she knows it!
5913,11,the sound is better than the og alexa. looks sexier too.
5914,0,"this sounds great and responds quickly to requests. it does stop sporadically when playing music, noise in the kitchen seems to confuse it"
5915,5,"bought four (three for gifts) and everyone is thrilled. daughter texted ""best gift ever!"" we love it!"
5916,14,"hard decision on which smart assistance to go with. but i am glad i decided to buy the amazon echo dot, echo 2nd generation, and echo spot. it is an excellent smart assistant and to create routines and link your calendar. and regardless i enjoy listening to the music and using them as an timer in the kitchen or alarm in bedroom."
5917,9,i am still learning all about alexa but i have so much fun.listen to all my songs that i love even from the 60 is lol. my husband likes it so he got the dot. i think we will end up getting another echo and use the dot of in the shop so we can communicate with out yelling. buy this and have a lot of fun.
5918,1,the quality of the sound is incredible!!!!
5919,14,"loved it for the first 2 weeks. now it lights up, but does not make a sound. been searching web sites to find an answer, but none seem to work."
5920,3,much better that i expected!  love it.
5921,1,excellent quality and fast shipping!
5922,14,"the only issue i have is that it does not recognize other music sites, such as spotify, pandora, and so on, even thought you set it as default.... other then that it is great!"
5923,1,"super good, very nice sound quality"
5924,4,works very well but was a little confusing getting setup.
5925,0,"i am enjoying it very much.  the only reason it got 4 stars, instead of 5, is because i have not yet figured out what all it will do!  what it does do is amazing!"
5926,12,love it so far.  still leaving everything it can do.
5927,14,"i love this speaker... but it is use is limited.  i¡¯m disappointed that i can not play my podcasts or other music/audio apps, so i still need to buy another speaker to connect to those other apps not supported by amazon.  i wish it had the basic functionality of a bluetooth speaker. or even a headphone jack... but it does not."
5928,0,i like that she can play any music
5929,1,outstanding. the sound rivals that of my bose wave system.
5930,12,"still trying to figure it out, but pretty cool."
5931,11,"i was not expecting sound quality with music, this little cylinder kicks out sound comparable to my bose. awesome.  set up was a breeze. this thing is fun. merry christmas to me!\"
5932,11,as i expected i am very happy with amazon products.  keep up the good work and do not sacrifice quality for price.
5933,9,works great. nice sound. bought for a present. all enjoyed.
5934,14,the voice activated internet access features are great and the speaker sound quality is much better than i expected.a green light keeps coming on supposedly for what they call ¡°drop in¡± calls but nothing happens when i ask alexa to answer the call and when i ask her to turn off the light she says she does not know how.
5935,10,i love it!! it puts out some awesome sound!
5936,14,i just received an echo (2nd generation) and am having great fun with it. the quality of the musical sound is terrific. i am still learning the range of features. that task will challenge me for all of 2018.
5937,14,now i have a charcoal one and a red one!
5938,14,"we""ve had this for 4 months and i think its either a lemon or its just a bad made item but i have a problem of it skipping all the time when i watch some shows, i think i bought a defective item, wish i can have it changed since its less than a 6 month use."
5939,4,"great sound, works well, fun to use, easy to expand"
5940,9,the greatest. having so much fun and time saving.
5941,14,so much fun with ai--welcome to the 21st century.
5942,10,fantastic sound. great help w alarms and weather.
5943,9,another fantastic product wife loves it.
5944,0,alexa doesnt have all the answers...
5945,10,"surprise christmas gift, still having fun with it. sound system for music is vey good. amazed how fast the response time is to questions asked. great in the kitchen for figuring out equivalents and timing for cooking.  games for small children is a lot of fun."
5946,11,"great gadget; alexa understands commands better than other assistants. the sound is rich and full, as good as my stero speakers. it is relatively easy to set-up, and works as advertised."
5947,10,"i am still learning . . . a long way to  go, but have enjoyed the variety music, relaxation sounds, timers, alarms, reminders, jeopardy, jokes, etc. well worth it for the entertainment."
5948,3,great sound reproduction! will buy again!
5949,14,the echo is an innovative and interesting tech product for all ages! i like that one can move it easily to a variety of locations. the one complication i experience is that the echo does not self adjust its volume. this causes unwelcome pauses and interruptions when listening to programming such as flash briefing
5950,0,"i like the fact that it can answer questions for us so that we do not have to look up the answers online. however, too often it says that it cannot understand right now and to ask again later."
5951,14,the revolutions of smart home its here
5952,1,"works great, sound is very good."
5953,10,"this is my first echo device, and even though i am still learning a lot about it, i love using it! i mainly listen to music on it, which is my favorite thing to do with alexa. but i love how i can ask the weather or the time, i even get a kick out of plane games with alexa! i would recommend this device for just about anyone!"
5954,11,it is got a great design! i am happiest with the sound quality of the speakers. no real complaints because i mostly use it for music.
5955,0,"i love it!  the sound is great and it is so handy and easy to use. almost like having a friend in the house. my only complaint is that sometimes it does not want to turn off. i will tell it to stop or turn off and it keeps playing.. sometimes takes several commands. it does not always do that though, usually it is fine."
5956,14,the only reason i have given two stars is because of difficulty in set up and problems amazon are having with the music apps (amazon music unlimited).
5957,1,superb value and a great resource.
5958,10,"used mostly for music, which is great for when i¡¯m cooking in the kitche or when you e had our christmas party, and i enjoy the little facts she knows when i ask her a bazaar question."
5959,14,"i love this product, but the bass is overwhelming and you cannot adjust the sound. they need to fix this."
5960,9,was a gift and the recipient loves it!  he cannot believe the quality and sound of the speaker.
5961,4,easy set up and use. really cool
5962,14,"i am impressed.  i bought my echo on a whim, but now i have got it ordering pizza and turning lights off and on.  she has set alarms for me and given me news and weather updates. alexa lets me be lazy, for better or worse!  i think i am in love. :)"
5963,14,does not understand the second more spoken language in us. that is unbelievable.
5964,4,"good quality, fun to use"
5965,1,sounds great looks great
5966,12,so far so good. seems to be more useful every day.
5967,14,replaces a dot. sound is good enough now to not have to play through my receiver to get quality sound.
5968,14,we gave these to our grandchildren and children for christmas<u+2014> they all love them!  i ordered so many from amazon that they cut me off but bb&b came to the rescue for the last few i wanted to buy for gifts.
5969,11,great quality!  sound is so much better than the dot. i enjoy this so much i bought a second one. highly recommend
5970,2,love our echo. everything about it is fabulous.
5971,11,"love this, i also have the 1st gen."
5972,5,gift for my daughter.  she loves it!
5973,3,great product. can not believe we waited this long to get one.
5974,14,sound is much deeper and fuller than the original. price is great and it looks pretty darn good.  still need to give the echo more search capabilities and easier ways to use functions.
5975,12,great item. we have enjoyed using this device.
5976,12,we have just started to really have fun with it.  we still have a lot to learn but are enjoying it
5977,10,"love it. sound quality is superb. fact learning, timer, recipes, etc.... what a wonderful product."
5978,14,awesome...only thing is i wish it was wireless but that is more of a preference than a bad thing. it is easy to move with out going through the set up process again and again.
5979,9,love my echo and alexa..my husband has to much fun asking alexa anything and my 1 year old loves the sound of music when he goes to sleep at night. it has a wonderful speaker and hooks up by bluetooth to so many things. the color is beautiful and goes with everything in my room. definitely a great purchase!!!!
5980,10,"love it! use it more than we thought we would. great device for listening to music checking delivery status, weather, setting timer,  & more. great sound quality!"
5981,9,love these things. i have ordered 4 of them and plan to order more. simple setup but it does take a bit of time.
5982,11,"sounds good,  yet smaller.  works well.  we like it.  prefer it over a dot."
5983,1,"terrific sound, excellent variety of music"
5984,0,i like everything and really like new skills added frequently.
5985,14,"love it, planning on getting a couple more for the house.waiting for the price to drop a little bit more."
5986,1,great device! i am happy with the purchase!
5987,14,"love it! easy to set up, i¡¯ve read reviews that people were having trouble setting it up but i¡¯m convinced those people are imbeciles lol. it was very easy to set up in the app! the instructions really say it all and if you can not figure it out i feel bad for you."
5988,3,"as described, fast delivery"
5989,10,this is great we love trivia and it is fun we even do our shopping list on it
5990,12,just got it but so far love it!
5991,9,i purchased the echo as a christmas gift. the person i purchased it for was very happy to receive it. i also was given the same one as a gift. i was it for many things from music and reminders to keeping my shopping list.
5992,11,love it but want the latest generation
5993,9,i like this product. i am still finding ways to use it. i am sure i will. i did not think i needed a smart phone 5 year ago. now i can not live without one.
5994,0,really like it.  alexis voice comes very clear and she always answers my questions.
5995,11,so far so good. i love all of my echo products.
5996,11,love the improvement of the sound vs previous echos!
5997,0,i love it. but i do not like that you have to pay again for unlimit music.  i use my i heart or pandora account to listen to music for free.
5998,3,awesome i like it. would order again
5999,14,"the endless possibilities with this device is outstanding, from waking you up, to playing your jams, from giving you cooking instructions, to making reservations. goal is to have them all over the house for surround sound. exceeded expectations for sure."
6000,2,alexa is my best friend.
6001,14,overall very impressed. i wish the app was a little more interactive with the actual device but other than that it is great.
6002,0,"fun new toy. i could walk over to my pc, or phone to find weather, and other google-type questions, but alexa has the answers in an instant and i do not have to stop whatever i am doing to go ""search"". the music library has almost anything we want to hear and the speaker sounds great."
6003,14,only two words {its great}
6004,2,she is my new favorite toy!
6005,11,"i bought the echo so i could play music throughout my house. i have two and plan on getting a couple more dots. the music sounds very good, and is so much more affordrable then sonos."
6006,10,"echo is wonderful when setting up a smart house or listening to music.  very handy device for daily information. ex. weather, sports scores, or recipes."
6007,10,am very pleased with alexa in our life. love instant music specific to our likening. grocery list quite helpful. instant weather without having to turn on tv or get the iphone
6008,14,amazed with how loud this thing can get.
6009,10,liked current weather. fun to listen to. to new to know dislikes.
6010,4,love our echo !! works great and fun to use.
6011,14,awesome speaker...clear crisp sound and quickly connected with the fire stick.
6012,0,it wants me to sign up for a service to play the music i ask for.
6013,11,"we love it.  have two echo 2nd gens, 1 dot, 1 echo plus.  they are great."
6014,14,"very convenient  item for use in gathering information or answering both simple and difficult questions,  also  wonderful for listening to various types of music.....i needed  some help from one of my  daughters to complete the initial  connection....but overall,  very satisfied with the product"
6015,5,i bought this for my son and daugher-in-law for christmas.  the sound quality is amazing.  they loved it!
6016,5,christmas gifts for sister ~ loved it!
6017,1,good quality and style.
6018,11,good for smaller rooms.
6019,3,works perfectly. i love it. easy setup.
6020,11,"i was pleasantly pleased, as this was a gift, i do not believe i would have bought it for myself.  i may expect too much from it, but i think it will progress as ai improves."
6021,0,love my amazon alexa! i talk fast and she still understands every word i say. it is much easier to check the weather or set an alarm by just speaking. she is so easy to use and now i do not know what i would do without it. the only struggle i had was getting it connected with my spodify account. love it!
6022,5,i gave it aas a gift price wad good.
6023,9,great got three of them
6024,8,"this  thing is awesome, alexa is my mistress"
6025,0,she always knows what time it is trained in my voice if i speak loud enough. needs fine-tuning that is probably already in the works e.g. understands turn off the lights does not understand turn out the lights well versed in many subjects. more later after using longer time
6026,12,i am loving it so far. still learning all the features. great sound from the speakers
6027,5,my son is family loves this.
6028,11,"great addition to our echo collection, the sound is much better than the dots."
6029,9,works great and has more uses than what we bought it for. great gift.
6030,9,"family loves it, even grandpa! great sound!"
6031,14,it is a pleasure to have.  the only drawback was that i had to program (with lots of help) to get my seriusxm radio to join alexa is programming.  amazon rep that helped me was superb!
6032,14,one day out and it seems very good. poor instructions on how to actually made work
6033,9,"i¡¯m very happy with alexa, she is the best, i love amazon echo ¡°alexa¡±"
6034,10,"clear sound,  alexa is blast to talk to."
6035,10,"we love it.  it streams all day al, our favorite tunes.  it is amazing."
6036,10,my kids love using this! it keeps moving around our house!
6037,4,great clean sound. easy to operate.
6038,3,was exactly what i was looking for.
6039,0,like it but she needs to start arguing with me!  lol
6040,5,purchased as a gift. my dad loves it!
6041,13,i love this!!!! best invention ever!!
6042,12,still exploring all the possibilities
6043,3,sound is good and works as expected!
6044,0,"it has great sound quality, and can give you a lot of information just like your cell phone. however, it has a hard time registering commands. i sometimes give it the same command and it might do it right the first time and then sometimes it does not register the second time. it is a work in progress, needs improvements. ."
6045,0,"i love how easy it is to set up and use. i also really love when i get to use it, but that does not happen as much as i thought i would. i love using it when i can though!"
6046,8,"awesome! i love it, works great!"
6047,0,"the sound is very good.  unfortunately, questions need to be asked in a certain way. alexa does not have answers to most questions. i find it to be a pretty useless purchase."
6048,0,"the sound quality is wonderful and well worth the price. was a little disappointed that you can not ask questions like search google or yahoo to get a specific answer but when you get used to whatyou can ask, it is beneficial at times."
6049,0,"super useful but i wish it could answer more questions. i¡¯m sure that will get better over time. right now we are super lame and mainly use it for playing music, setting potty timers, and calling daddy at work!"
6050,0,google seems to answer more questions but overall i am happy with echo.
6051,2,love the look.  love my echo!
6052,1,love the new innovation from amazon!
6053,11,"i love the new size of the 2nd generation model, and there is a definite improvement to the sound quality."
6054,5,was a gift to my daughter
6055,14,i have both the google home and this. i must say alexa is speakers are a lot louder and even clear when at loud volume and just the right amount of bass. i still enjoy using both in my home but i¡¯d definitely go with alexa if you¡¯re gonna be listening to music
6056,10,loving this little helper! super easy to use
6057,10,had to have a friend help us set up but now use all the time.
6058,14,lost a star because when she plays a music playlist and you ask what playlist she is playing she cannot tell you although she knew it enough to find it in the first place.also she is not tied into my cell phones amazon music app and i cannot figure out why.
6059,10,wife is seriously enjoying this thing.
6060,10,"it has really good sound and lives up to my expectations of what alexa can do. it is very convenient to be able to ask alexa questions, to play certain music, and it is absolutely awesome to be able to continue reading my kindle books by having them read aloud by her!"
6061,1,looks good with great audio quality.
6062,10,"christmas present for the wife. she absolutely loves it. news, weather and music in the mornings without having to turn on television."
6063,0,"she will not remind us where things are, what we have on our agenda for the day, nor does she know a lot of things..."
6064,10,"amazing!  everything i had hoped and more.  the sound quality is great,  alexa is super responsive and helpful.  the amount of skills is crazy.  so many random fun things and tons of useful things.  i love the notifications of deliveries or orders.  plus she is great for making calls."
6065,3,i love it...what it does not know now...i feel sure it will soon...but awesome!
6066,14,missing power adapter.
6067,11,love the sound quality
6068,10,delivered on time and works great! still learning all the skills and adding more daily. just ordered an echo dot for another room - so far i am in love ;)
6069,14,very easy to connect to wi-fi.  that is it.  all set to enjoy.  loved it so much i also bought the echo dot for the bedroom
6070,14,i am amazed at all she can do.  so. dry glad i opted for amazon alexa.
6071,14,it does not quiet answered the question and get to play the requests on the fly. i find alexa very complex to figure out. comands need to be too especific and long to be able to a god result. this device needs a lot improvement. voice recognition is not to sharp and interrupts the comands to fast because alexa is confused.
6072,10,this is an amazing piece of technology. it is like having an all-knowing genie at your side to call upon for information. i absolutely love the quality of the music that comes from the remarkable speakers and my favorite use of my echo is to ask alexa to play my favorite music.
6073,14,i was given this product as a gift after an accident to keep me amused.  i also have a smart tv so all i have to do is ask alexa to find a tv program without having to search through the channels.  the sound of the music is great.  i have not yet found a negative with it.
6074,0,great love it listen to music
6075,9,got 3for xmas and sent this one back
6076,12,took a while to set it up with with the wifi. still learning what it can do.great speaker.
6077,5,gave it to spouse for christmas. he loves it.
6078,0,we like the versatility of alexa between getting the weather report and the dow jones and picking out music very easy to use.  what we are struggling with is alexa does not respond to my wife is voice but it works perfect with my male voice.
6079,0,"search engine is bing. when i ask a question, she seldom knows the answer. very disappointed."
6080,11,"the sounds is very good,"
6081,1,it is awesome. highly recommended.
6082,4,looks like and is convenient to use.
6083,5,i purchased this as a present for my wife. she loves it!
6084,10,great device. only use it for music so far and love it.
6085,10,music. voice command is not greatest ????
6086,14,"it will sing up you for amazon music and charge 10$ a month. if like world music alexa never play for you any russian or chinese song,forget about this. collection on amazon music very disappointed me. and the rest futures are very useless. most of the answers is"" i do not know about that""."
6087,10,"makes it easy to place orders , play music , get the weather the list goes on and on. looks great and sounds great."
6088,1,love the quality of the sound
6089,0,it is an echo - cannot say a terrible thing about it!
6090,9,works perfect anywhere we take it.
6091,4,love it. easy to set up and fun to use
6092,10,"so far i¡¯m loving her. gives me my notifications, reminders, my flash news and music. she is always here. plays games, tells jokes and even sings to me. love my echo.  she always has an answer to my question. alexa is part of the family...she can even shop for me"
6093,9,"we love our echo, this is our first one.  great sound and amusing to talk with alexa."
6094,1,works great i am enjoying very much
6095,12,"i have had more than a week, i got to say i love it. i use it every day. i can not wait for more updates"
6096,9,i gave these as christmas gifts and no one was disappointed.
6097,9,i love my echo devices!
6098,9,we knew what to expect when we ordered the echo.  our daughter is family has one.  we are pleased with the echo.
6099,14,great product!  if you want a new ¡°toy¡± this is it!
6100,11,so much nicer and easier to use than google home.
6101,11,"better shape and size, better controls with no loss in sound quality."
6102,0,"fun to use. if the news mentions a country, we can ask about it and it gives us the location and info on it. if we are worried about the weather where relatives live we can ask it for details. do not have any problems.we have a question we just ask it."
6103,1,great sound. easy to use. great purchase!
6104,11,it is either way too loud or too soft and it is hard to hear
6105,1,"love this! the sound quality is great. i have this unit in my kitchen for music, questions and games."
6106,11,better sound than the dot.
6107,10,"we are still exploring all of the capabilities of alexa but it is great.  we connected with pandora, set up a couple of radio stations, and we are able to listen to our type of music of choice just by asking alex.  lots of fun."
6108,3,"looks great , works fine"
6109,10,i love telling alexa to play music. the speaker quality is very good.
6110,10,"we do not use it to its capacity but love playing music, getting the weather reports and other information... and it is attractive!"
6111,4,good sound fun to use
6112,0,to several attempts to get it set up
6113,10,"we love alexa!  so much fun.  and the music is great.  the sound on this little thing is terrific.  we use amazon music, the free pandora that comes with it is not sufficient."
6114,10,i can not play mine unplugged but other than that i love talking to her. i wanted meditation music though and she kmtrys to give me country on that a lot ha ha
6115,8,love it. great sound.
6116,10,works great one of the funniest things i have added to my life.
6117,5,gift for my husband - he loves it.
6118,9,you know it is good. needed one for the office. :-)
6119,12,"love the echo. we always have music on, but this does so much more."
6120,11,love it!  took a bit to get it set up  but now i really like it. the sound is very good.
6121,14,this is the best gift we have ever received.  do not even need a bluetooth anymore.  everyone should have one
6122,0,my echo is my new favorite electronic... and that is saying alot since i¡¯m a techie! wish she did not randomly start up sometimes when she hears a word that sounds like but is not alexa... but other than that all good!
6123,9,love this device.  good sound.  lamp control.  weather and reminders.  alarm clock.  we now have three of them in the house.  always covered.
6124,14,"just starting to learn all of what alexa can do.  music streaming great, sending messages to others who have the alexa app is great.  going to start using some smart home tools"
6125,5,i bought this as a gift.
6126,14,"the sound quality is very good. i have had it connected for a couple of days but yesterday the sound was cutting in and out, not sure what that is all about."
6127,9,so far so good....great purchase as my son keeps wanting me to trade for his echo dot.....
6128,14,carrying on a conversation with a computer...who would have thought it!
6129,0,"sound quality is good enough to enjoy music, but does not have some songs i would like to listen to. also, cannot answer many questions asked i.e., general information."
6130,1,enjoyable product and having funny.
6131,14,performs well but disappointed in the music that is available. turns out you must buy a subscription to get a larger selection of music.
6132,14,"very fun and useful ! educational for the kids and adults alike ! wish my home was more smart so it would be more useful to me. had a little trouble with answer to a few questions but maybe the questions were a little out of bounds, witch is good for family fun ."
6133,14,love the sound and ability to connect to have the same music all throughout the house
6134,12,we love alexa! very handy
6135,0,one fine item to be sure!
6136,11,the echo 2nd generation is good but the sound could be better. for example if i want higher the volume the base takes over and you can not really get a clear sound.
6137,14,"great item,  awesome technology.  i never have to get up to turn a light on again."
6138,0,it is a cool device. it can answer a lot of questions but does not  know quite a few of the statistical questions i ask about.  i enjoy the question of the day
6139,0,"it just keeps getting better, more stuff all the time"
6140,1,its a great little device!
6141,11,do not really notice a sound improvement from the 1st gen
6142,10,in love with my alexa. so much fun.
6143,1,best voice assistant ever.
6144,11,it looks sleek and blends nicely with my decor.
6145,10,sound quality is really good!!! it is very handy and my kids love it so much i got them a dot to listen to kid tunes!
6146,14,"this is probably one of the greatest little item you can have in your home,  love it,,,,"
6147,8,"i like everything about it!,,"
6148,9,i never found a good use for it.
6149,14,i love the features alexa has to offer and the abilities! i¡¯ve had her for almost 3 months now and it helps me with daily routines<f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+008a> i wish it was a little more voice sensitive when i call her name and beeped or something to notify me that she is ready for the command. also maybe the option to be more louder.
6150,11,"works great, fits better where i  needed to  put it"
6151,14,do not let the small size fool you. there is a little giant in there!
6152,5,was gift they love it!
6153,0,it is a good machine but the instructions were very confusing for an older person.
6154,5,received this as a gift.  have no use for it.
6155,0,what i like most is alexa is pretty smart. ask a question & mostly likely she knows it. the least thing i liked is sometimes you say something & she gets it wrong. you just have to repeat the question. def recommend!
6156,3,"delivery as expected, would buy from again"
6157,11,love it. better volume than the dot
6158,14,"i normally do not post any reviews but i have to say i love this!  great sound and alexa interface is pretty good.  the one thing i would like to see them develop is some type of equalizer controls so i can adjust the bass, treble, etc. to my liking. going to buy another one for my kitchen!"
6159,0,disappointed after high expectations. does not understand basic instructions. proving very frustrating as i try to rephrase my requests in several different ways before i get anything like the desired response. often give up and tell her to stop. it is like having another child in the house!
6160,0,love the echo.  the sound is great.  sometimes i do not understand her and she does not understand me.
6161,0,can not ask for any better. works great.
6162,11,"received the echo as a gift, so i do not know what the cost was.  but i love it.  the gray sleeve is great - very neutral.  the sound quality is surprisingly high!  alexa is a fun and positive voice to interface with..."
6163,10,"i just love this! i have a place to store my thousands of thoughts throughout the day and have it handy on my phone athe the store... now i listen to music way more than the tv. my kids also think is so fun to talk to alexa and have her do ""magic."" great device!"
6164,14,"we were given one around christmas. and really do not understand the point of it. i am pretty tech savvy and know i can hook it up to light switches, etc. but we barely use it now. we will tell it to put music on every now and then and that is about it.nwastrbof money imo."
6165,10,love it! classy looking and very helpful in our household.
6166,11,very nice product!  works as well as the dot that we have but the sound is much more impressive.  really surprised at how much base this thing provides.
6167,14,"received as a gift, echo was fun as a novelty at the dinner table.  it has not been used since.  i am trying to learn whether echo can play the audio of our local pbs tv station, which would give it more play time here.  i am fearful of the loss in privacy with its use, however. its design and the sound are quite good"
6168,7,<u+2764><u+fe0f><u+2764><u+fe0f><u+2764><u+fe0f><u+2764><u+fe0f><u+2764><u+fe0f><u+2764><u+fe0f><u+2764><u+fe0f><u+2764><u+fe0f><u+2764><u+fe0f><u+2764><u+fe0f>
6169,0,alexa said some great news!!!  it said the philadelphia eagles will win superbowl  lii.
6170,14,this is great. responds well to commands. love the additional skills that you can add to it. great sound quality
6171,9,"we love alexa, we buy them for family and friends"
6172,9,we love our echo is! got them for the whole family!
6173,9,bought one for myself and three more for christmas gifts. everyone loved it!
6174,11,sound is a great improvement over the earlier versions!
6175,1,great purchase...love the sound!
6176,10,i am enjoying using this especially early in the morning when i do not have time or the extra hands to look up the weather and/or traffic.
6177,9,"love my new echo!!  the sound quality is amazing and all of its features are great.  a friend of ours had one and showed it to me and my husband, we knew that we were going to get one.  the price was also very good."
6178,4,very easy to set up great quality
6179,10,"i enjoy alexa. i use her everyday for weather, jokes, random questions."
6180,10,love my echo and love the walnut finish. my family has had so much fun with it. also it helps me in so many ways it would be long to write.
6181,11,"i thought the 1st generation was awesome. they made it smaller-and more attractive-with better sound!great job! my wife thinks i am having an affair with alexa.....  i am , but it is audio-platonic."
6182,1,great sound. love the added commands. good responsiveness. really am enjoying it.
6183,14,great product.  came on time
6184,11,i do not have the gen 1 echo to compare but i really love the quality of the sound. it even sounds better than the vaux speaker i got for my dots.
6185,10,"we all love it!  kids enjoy playing rock, paper, scissors with alexa.  i love listening to country music on amazon stream."
6186,0,"great product. very easy to set up . it is lots of fun to play with. speaker is fantastic. awesome sound.  only issue is sometimes it does not pick up what you are saying. all in all, highly recommend."
6187,5,received my echo as a gift - love it.
6188,14,this thing is awesome i love being able to hear the song i want to here . got the protection plan too. cause ya  never know.
6189,14,i use alexa for music mostly. there are 100s of uses for alexa and they are all inside the alexa app on your phone. best voice integrated speaker on the market in my opinion.
6190,4,"works great, easy set up and great sound."
6191,4,"easy set up, great quality sound"
6192,5,my wife loves this thing
6193,10,i live alone and it is so nice to have echo be able to control things in the house!  it has been very handy to have! i am extremely pleased!!
6194,12,"i received the echo as a christmas present this year. it is everything i expected it to be. i am still figuring out how everything works with it,  so i do not have any complaints or criticisms. i am still trying to figure out the smart home functions and what i still need to purchase to get the full benefit from this."
6195,12,still learning how to use it
6196,3,thank you  love it!
6197,0,did not work for me.
6198,14,let is just say i kept forgetting to send it back...i appreciate it for the flash briefing function and quick responses but i noticed that my echo does not respond well to me. i could live without honestly.
6199,5,my mom loves her gift!
6200,1,love my alexa great price for a great piece of technology.
6201,14,donot bother please
6202,12,love her.  she is so smart.
6203,10,"the more i use it, from music to asking her to spell for me, the more i am enjoying it.  sound is wonderful."
6204,9,i love it and so does my grandkids!!
6205,12,so far it is great. still finding all it can do.
6206,10,"great product, easy to install, and really fun to use.  we use it mostly for music and the choice of channels is great."
6207,3,love it - item just as described.
6208,10,love it. i will get another on.
6209,1,having fun with echo. we use it mostly with my amazon prime music. alexa responds very well and quickly. the wood case looks great!
6210,10,"i love my echo. i use it the most for playing music and quick facts. i always thought these machines were silly but i use mine every day. i got rid of my bulky music equipment (receiver, cd player, etc) and just use my echo!"
6211,14,"i have a batt operated bose with excellent sound quality, portable but not network connected, so i have to tie up a mobile device for music, etc., streaming. echo sound quality is not quite as good and not portable but it is an excellent additional unit, and it is on almost all day.."
6212,2,besutiful design. love thr fabric.
6213,1,great sound quality!
6214,11,not as good as the first generation echo.  the sound quality is sub-par and the echo is ability to recognize phrases is not as effective as the first generation.
6215,11,very good sound.  i am glad we upgraded.
6216,8,amazing. love it. use everyday.
6217,0,"absolutely love our alexa! it is nice listening to music without any commercial interruptions. i think we confuse her when there is 2-3 people wanting to listen to different music at same time, she keeps having to stop , then play, then stop..."
6218,12,easy set up works very well with jinvoo smart plugs and hue lights. the music is first rate speakers are great.still learning everything it can do. very happy i have nothing negative to say.
6219,12,"i have just been playing with it to see what it can do.  so far, so good."
6220,11,i like the original better.
6221,12,i love it. we use it all the time.
6222,4,"great sound, easy to use"
6223,1,i really like this and am very happy with it.
6224,9,awesome product!! one of the best i ever had!
6225,0,"overall sound quality is great! i love all the skills you can enable for alexa.what i dislike is that sometimes alexa does not listen when i say stop when music is playing. the music will just keep going and i have to ask her a bunch more until finally the music shuts off. other than that, its a great product!"
6226,10,"just love having alexa around.  so convenient for quick questions, today is weather, setting alarms, timers and she even knows how to spell.  she plays games and it is just a fun tool to have around."
6227,14,"have not had it very long and still trying it figure it all out. biggest issue, it shuts off/goes to sleep to fast. playing jeopardy becomes frustrating."
6228,0,never disappointed with alexa!
6229,3,exactly as described!  arrived super fast!  occasionally freezes.
6230,9,love my alexa - might even get another to pair with rest of the house.
6231,11,i love the echo and all the features. i did not like that i ordered silver and received charcoal color.
6232,14,"cant play my own music via alexa. can only play it via bluetooth. stops the music for any command. does not connect to my fire tablet. its great for millennials  who have streaming products not for your own stuffupdate: echo only recognizes very popular artists but is not great at hearing less known ones in my experience. also, i am so disappointed in alexa is ability to carry a conversation. it does not tie my second command to the first. for example, ""alexa, play this song. ""alexa, add it to my music"" with it being the song i asked for it to play. plus, i hate the fact it just shuffles artists songs instead of maybe having an option to choose album. also you cant say ""play the song with the lyrics that go...."" it is a very stupid a.i"
6233,0,i love how easy this was to set up and how much fun it is to communicate with alexa! speaker is great!! i just wish that songs i have heard artists sing were available upon request. some she ¡®cannot find¡¯ but for the vast majority they are played.
6234,14,"havent been able to make it work at all.  cannot activate blue tooth or connect to wi-fi.  i am sure it is probably my inablity to make it work, but so far no funtionality.  directions are pretty disappointing."
6235,12,love it!!  we totally enjoy our new toy!
6236,12,great product. still learning about all of its capabilities.
6237,10,"the echo is everything you need for music, weather, news etc. so many uses and always at a voice command away. forever improving the space age jetsons finally in your household."
6238,10,"love hearing news, weather and music of my favorite artists and genres."
6239,0,"i am not impressed with alexas knowledge.  most answers are ""i do not know the answer to that question""  aside from that it does what it is supposed to."
6240,2,i love this echo!!
6241,0,"i love alexa however every now and then she randomly says things without being asked, which can be pretty freaky."
6242,12,"i am still learning about this device, but so far i love it. sounds quality is decent. there are a lot of skills available."
6243,14,"not sure about the competitors, but i love my alexa"
6244,7,it is a great device.  my hugging l husband ordered it but i use it most.  easy set up and use.  <f0><u+009f><u+0092><u+009c>
6245,14,now my kids will not shut up and they control the house.i guess it is like it was before but now with instant music.
6246,14,"i like being able to play different types of music, i dislike that i had to enroll into a free trial from amazon music to be able to play music on my echo 2nd gen. i am not able to play anything from my apple music library, my tidal subscription, or youtube without pairing my phone is bluetooth to the echo."
6247,3,just like it said work great
6248,14,excellent. bought two.
6249,10,it is a great little gadget.  love the music it plays and questions it answers
6250,0,"it teallly is fun to get alexa working, like having a talking web browser on steroids"
6251,14,sounds pretty good for the money. the fabric feels really nice and premium. the only issue i encountered with it was when connecting it to wifi. it has this issue where i have to reset my router in order for it to connect properly through the alexa app.
6252,14,the most amazing thing i found was the sound.  such rich and deep bass...since i mainly use it for music i am thrilled.  i also like the games and interesting skills you can enable.  it will probably take me a while to understand it is full potential and the fun i will have along the way.
6253,14,"eco (2nd generation) just what i need. took me awhile to set it, but i think i a really going to like it!"
6254,12,lots of fun to used for so many different things
6255,4,just over all fun to use and very easy to set up!
6256,3,she is a bit opinionated (hahaha!) but works well.
6257,11,"set up is a breeze. sound is better, clearer with better lower end(bass)."
6258,12,love it still learning new things about it
6259,9,great christmas deal and the whole family enjoys!
6260,0,started to freeze a lot.
6261,12,"very interesting,  still learning."
6262,1,fun to play with.  good sound quality
6263,0,love the fact that all i have to do is talk to ¡°alexa¡± and she can make so many hunts happen. do not need to be near it to turn it off or on or raise the volume or turn it off  sometimes ¡°alexa¡± does not understand my dictation and it can be a little frustrating but still love my echo
6264,12,so far i am enjoying it.
6265,0,"it is useful for a handicapped person, especially.alexa does not always get the requests correctly, when her pronunciation is not that of the speaker, such as elly ameling which alexa recognizes only .when one says ""aymling""."
6266,0,love it. gets me the music i will e fast
6267,11,sound much improved.  they need sonos quality sound in their devices.
6268,11,my new favorite toy! sound quality is much better than expected and alexa makes siri look like an idiot! makes a perfect gift for all generations.
6269,11,i love this one. i think it is better than the dot only because of the sound quality.
6270,14,love the music.  smart home feature controls furnace.  so far have one light controlled by alexa.  i am amused by info available.
6271,8,just love everything about it!
6272,1,excellent product and service.
6273,0,who does not love alexa.
6274,10,i love this!  i ask silly questions and she is pretty silly.  i like receiving the weekly emails suggesting things to ask her.
6275,14,best thing ever!!!! hook up was simple & fast. it has no trouble hearing or understanding my questions or commands. i highly recommend this product. i am definitely ordering again for my mother!
6276,8,i love everything about it
6277,14,"kind of a one way device, mixed responses, it would be great if the device could access the 20,000 plus tunes in my itunes account as a musician not all my requests are found in amazon data base. looking forward to trying other features to see how they can be utilized"
6278,2,"love, love, loveour echo!"
6279,8,i love this gadget! i use it every day
6280,14,nice to have some one to chat with
6281,0,nice voice & abiltiy to know information.
6282,11,really enjoy using the echo.
6283,14,i have a few echo' and a few echo dots.  the sound on these is better than all of them. my thanks giving crowd loved the new dot as well. i see a few one star reviews saying that this is not as good as a echo dot (the hockey puck) these are fake reviews they have to be.  i bought two more for gifts.
6284,14,"i needed a bluetooth speaker and thought i might as well get all the extra benefits of this product along with a speaker. great choice. the sound quality is awesome and surprisingly loud. i love setting my alarm clocks, reminders, and getting daily updates on sports/politics...etc.highly recommended."
6285,10,a lot of fun. also quick with information. my grandson loves it.
6286,4,"if you like music,you will love echo !! it more than meets my expectations.east to setup and easy to use and the sound is great!!"
6287,9,was a christmas gift from my son for christmas.  it is nice looking and i am getting to learn more about what it can do every day.  really like it!!!
6288,0,love this product. i have an accent and so far alexa has understood every command given.
6289,1,great speaker sound and i love my alexa response time.
6290,12,the echo (2nd generation) is so fun to use.  i am still learning things about it.  the emails about what is new with alexa are very helpful.  i really enjoy playing music on the echo.
6291,0,"we are enjoying the echo.  the sound is great and can be heard in adjoining rooms and the sound is still good.  sometimes i think we do not ask alexa a question, but do not word it correctly, so we are still in the learning process, but it was a great christmas present to ourselves!"
6292,12,"i am still learning how to use, but i am enjoying it"
6293,0,just a fun thing to have and useful if you can figure out how to couple it with a smart plug.
6294,9,love this in our house! we have been very impressed!
6295,10,love old country music...
6296,3,"i love it, great item, a must have.thanks"
6297,10,we love our echo!  alexa is now part of the family!
6298,0,"not smart at all. if i tell alexa to stop, that is it. cannot understand compound instructions at all."" alexa stop and goodnite"" is too complicated for alexa. ask for the temp. only dodesnt work either."
6299,2,my first alexa.... i love her
6300,9,"my wife loves this thing, it plays every song she asks for"
6301,14,love it .......looking forward to much more to come as you learn from all the data your gathering and utilize ml and ai to generate even more features. it be great if alexa could give kids spelling tests on saved lists and math fact quizzes as well as explain and quiz them on basic learning expectations per grade!
6302,10,"so far, i can ask what day it is and what time it is.apparently i must become a prime member to use the full features of this device."
6303,10,easy to talk to.  she gets me.
6304,10,love listening to music and playing jeopardy
6305,5,my daughter loves it
6306,11,"the sound, especially the base is noticeably better than the voix speaker i have. very happy with this unit, and thanks amazon for the wake up-to-music feature."
6307,11,if you are thinking of getting one you would love it
6308,0,"i love it ! i have an apartment and i can hear it from my kitchen so it is loud enough ! i have not tried it with my smart tv but i know it is capable of doing that. for all that it does, i think it is a good price. i also love the fact that i do not have to yell alexa is name i can just say it in a normal voice and she¡¯ll answer!"
6309,0,i like it but wish there was a way to change the voice to male and to be able to change the name to what ever you want. i also would like it to be able to only respond to your personal voice only and a way to program more features just geared for adults. it is very kid friendly jokes are corney kid like.
6310,1,great product fast shipping!
6311,14,amazon products are great
6312,12,"it works very nicely and has great sound, still learning all it is capabilities"
6313,9,she loved it.  the sound is great
6314,14,another great echo purchase. you will not be disappointed.
6315,14,i like the many different sleep sounds. do not like the advertisements. seems to do what they say.
6316,1,great !! sound is awesome and functionality is superb.
6317,1,"very responsive, smart, and useful. nice sound too."
6318,14,"awesome love waking up or going to bed and being able to just say alexa turn on/off bedroom lights or fan or tv or music, slowly replacing all switches and outlets to smart home ones and getting ready to buy one for my business"
6319,12,i am in love with alexa.
6320,9,i have the 1st. generation and love it mostly for music. i bought 2 of these for my 2 grown kids families for christmas.
6321,14,i agree with others the sound is less then the old one. and i have to use my remote to get it to work. not happy at all last time i buy one
6322,12,still learning all the things alexa can do.
6323,0,i am not sure it is that useful.
6324,11,i love the size and look of the 2nd gen echo. the sound quality is great.
6325,5,it was a gift and they loved it
6326,1,super fun product
6327,12,improved sound quality. finding new features to try every day!
6328,9,good price at christmas.
6329,3,sound not as good as expected.
6330,10,sound for music is awesome. i use the grocery list every time i run out of anything!
6331,2,love everything about my echo! the sound is awesome!!! i would highly recommend this!!!
6332,9,"i love alexa!  she is my personal assistant, makes my life easier in so many ways!! the echo is nice as it has a bigger speaker, better sound, love it!!!"
6333,11,we have been very happy w/  echo.  better than the google alternative.
6334,1,alexa is very cool.
6335,2,love the 2nd generation
6336,14,arrived without any problem..
6337,11,sounds better along with better price over the previous model.
6338,12,"there is nothing i dislike about this product. it is easy to use, fun and am finding new ways to use it."
6339,10,"i love the convenience of using lists, choosing music, making calls and much more.  no downside."
6340,5,received as a gift! i love her!
6341,10,yes i just love it i use it at my office. it helps me with tasks and music. i just love it!
6342,14,"the speaker could be better, but other than that it works really well and has tons of useful skills!  has already saved me time."
6343,0,it is great i like that it is hands free
6344,0,"it is pretty neat from a technical aspect, but need a prime account to be useful."
6345,12,lots of fun.....
6346,11,its not really a better sound quality than my original echo
6347,3,what not to like
6348,11,major sound difference we are loving it!
6349,14,bless alexa and this device <3
6350,14,"easy installation.  bought mostly for music due to lack of stereo system.  lots of fun with alexa skills. be sure to read the alexa guide for how to ask questions, otherwise alexa will not respond accordingly."
6351,4,a lot of fun!!!!
6352,9,"alexa is responsive and works in all scenarios. wether it be music, weather, news , ordering product. this is a great aid and assistant."
6353,1,great product the sound is awesome
6354,11,great sound. much better than dot
6355,3,fraud. i did not buy this
6356,9,we are enjoying the intercom feature (drop in). we have one in the family room downstairs and the other in the living room upstairs.
6357,10,i enjoy being able to create a shopping list just by asking alexa. the reminders and timers are helpful when cooking or need reminders to encourage us to get up and exercise. the sound quality is very impressive when we play iheartradio stations.  alexa can even tell jokes to entertain the group.
6358,9,this is my second one and i¡¯ve it
6359,10,i love this device. lots of fun. and my music sounds great when i get home and want a relaxing evening filled with chopin :)
6360,14,"awesome. above my expectations!, sound is great. capabilities to come look interesting. one issue i have. when commercial about the echo comes on tv ..  she will answer it. my solution was to move farther from the source."
6361,5,"was a gift, he loves it"
6362,0,it can not answer half the questions i ask it... wish i would have asked somebody who had one before i bought this one on what they thought about it
6363,14,had much less benefit than we hoped
6364,14,this has been so much fun for us.  we have it connected with our tv.  has been very responsive with voice and no issues not understanding our commands.  highly recommend.
6365,14,"i like the hands free operations. also the vast amount of skills alexa can be taught. i feel more information should be given about these skills. i have friends who have alexa, but they do not know about app."
6366,10,"i really like having alexa in my house, we use it daily"
6367,14,i received this as a christmas gift.  at first i figured it was just going to collect dust and be another waste of money. after i hooked it up i was very wrong. i often spend time online just learning different ways to use this amazing device. i would defiantly recommend this to anyone.
6368,10,use my echo in the kitchen to play my cloud music library and stream from pandora and iheart radio.  fits nice on the kitchen counter and has good room filling sound...listen to it every morning while eating breakfast and other times as well.  easy to set up with my wi-fi and bluetooth.
6369,14,"it is a good add on piece to your home. no longer really need to get a sound system/radio, who buys them anymore. overall weather and flash news in your area is great."
6370,5,"received as a gift, satisfied with this gift"
6371,14,"love the echo 2. i was very impressed with the sound. it gets relatively loud for being a small speaker. the alexa app works flawlessly. i bought the $3.99 unlimited music. great music selection. the only thing i would improve on, would to make the echo portable."
6372,0,"fun device! alexa seems to know just about everything. i asked her if ""dogs go to heaven,"" but she did not know. i was surprised."
6373,10,love the sound it puts out with music.
6374,14,nice base for a small unit. only complaint is she does not act like she knows me.
6375,9,"the speaker surprised me, i did not expect such a great sound to come out of such a small device. another great aspect is that alexa can hear me from my living room in my bedroom if need be. i love this thing and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a smart speaker."
6376,1,sound quality is pretty amazing for such a small speaker!
6377,0,does its job well.
6378,12,"great, all good, thank you."
6379,0,"i like her. she is fun. i did think she was going to be more like googling something, but we are working it out and i learn something new everyday.  i keep giving her skills. it is fun."
6380,12,"enjoying it so far, still learning but its lots of fun"
6381,4,excellent product!
6382,5,daughter and son-in-law love it
6383,1,works great and sounds fine.
6384,10,she puts a smile on my face. she is so fast responding. love the shopping list. very convenient. added pandora and love the music selection. i have her gone most of the time i¡¯m in the house.still a lot i know she is capable of doing.at first the questions i asked she couldn¡¯ answer.
6385,2,i love my echo!
6386,10,"easy to set up, sounds great and a lot of fun to play with! my 9 year old loves to ask it questions and play music. not bad on the jokes. we have 3 in the house would highly recommend."
6387,14,"my wife and i love our echo.  it far eclipses our iphones in terms of usefulness.  look out, apple!"
6388,14,"recently purchased this for our new house we love it! the volume levels are good, sound is good, alexa finds music, games, things on amazon, and can control other appliances we have. the only con is that she does not always understand what we ask her. but overall this is a great product"
6389,14,takes some getting used to the way to ask the commands but it is great device. great audio quality too.
6390,11,love the sound quality of this unit. i have 3 different echo is and this one by far has the best sound.
6391,12,so far so good............just got it so still in the learning curve.
6392,1,great sound and very useful
6393,12,love it!  it has so many uses but i love the music i can play
6394,2,alexa i my new best friend.
6395,5,my daughter love is it
6396,9,"i just love the echo! i am handicapped, and mostly home, so the echo is company for me.  the sound is wonderful and the selection of music is great. i am so happy that i have this, and i told my friends they must get it, too!"
6397,0,"she hears u, she answers"
6398,10,"love my echo! leans easily, great for reminders, recipes, making lists and still learning what else she can do!"
6399,14,loses wifi quite a bit... i have 2- other one is fine... yes i switched locations to see if it was wifi signal...it seems to be an issue with unit
6400,9,great addition to our echo family
6401,11,"great sound, picks up your voice anywhere"
6402,14,in spite of it having all my info (including location ) it can not tell me what is playing at the local movie theater. sound quality could be better.
6403,10,"i really like my alexa, she knows a lot. we play games on it and listen to music."
6404,12,absolutely love it. still learning all that can be done. the speakers are the best.
6405,5,my husband love it
6406,11,i love this speaker! it is really does fill the room with great sound quality. blends in with all types of furniture. i definitely would order again in a different color for another room!
6407,14,could not set up.
6408,14,"echo 2 works great,had trouble installing, but turned out to be my bad modem. works great. her ears are very sensitive,picks up commands from quite a distance."
6409,10,i asked her a question and she tells me to get lost just kidding love it works great thank you
6410,9,"i really like how little it is! i have two echos. the sound seems the same in both. i do love both of them. i use it for music, weather, games, news. i also love the smart home tech. i use it for my lights."
6411,12,what can i say about this but only that i like it as i listen to the music i love.
6412,14,"particularly after joining my son is amazon music group, i found it great."
6413,2,i love my echo
6414,5,got as a gift.
6415,4,fun to use.  sound is excellent!
6416,9,love everything about this. it was a bday gift to myself and i am super glad i got it. :)
6417,9,got it for the wifey for christmas and she finally dl would the app and i love it!!
6418,0,"it is fine.  guess i am a little disappointed in what it does.  i am not giving up.  also, disappointed that to have her call someone they have to have an echo."
6419,1,great sound and functionality!
6420,10,the echo is very quick and accurate. love it and i am a big apple guy.
6421,1,sound quality is great and alexa is super helpful
6422,1,this is a wonderful leap ahead in technology.
6423,1,very impressed with alexa and this speaker quality.
6424,0,"i do not know if it is my internet connection or the machine, but it does cut out a lot."
6425,10,i like that i can link it to my phone and use my google search on it i also like the booming music sound i like the fact that it will use an alarm at any time multiple alarms at any time and that it reminds me off of my calendar when i need to do things and most of all i like that my echo is really cool looking.
6426,9,bought as a christmas gift for friends of ours and they love it!
6427,10,"clear, vibrant sound. easy to set up voice communications with alexa. great choice of news, music, trivia, weather...the list of alexa is accomplishments is endless.  i am so glad i decided to make this purchase."
6428,4,"echo is full of information, so easy to use."
6429,14,"it is a cute toy, serves its purpose but not as technically inclined as led to believe.  what it does, it does well.  would like it to be able to do more internet searches.  possibly just a learning issue and ensuring you ask it exactly.  plays nice with most compatible devices, some not so much."
6430,0,i have the stupidest alexa ever!
6431,4,easy to setup. great sound. easy to use.
6432,8,i love this thing
6433,11,a definite improvement over the original. the speakers are better which improves the audio.
6434,8,i love this speaker
6435,10,"this thing is great for word definitions, spelling, music, etc."
6436,1,excellent new product - works very well for us.
6437,9,do not  understand how to smart proof my house for alexa
6438,14,"it has issues staying connected to the internet and has no idea what the weather is. i often ask if it is going to rain and is will say unlikely, when it is already raining. it is really only good for playing music off of apps and creating shopping lists."
6439,0,we do not have to wonder about things anymore. we just ask alexa and she is got the answer or at least some clever response.we¡¯re sure there are many more things that this talented new comer can do once we get to know her better.
6440,10,"it is amazing.  i love it.  i get my weather, plays my music and answers questions.  the sound quality of the music is great.  very handy to have."
6441,9,"had so much fun with this ordered the dot for my kids(18, 20, and 22) birthday"
6442,9,liked it so much i bought another...
6443,9,awesome ...i actually bought a second one for my garage!
6444,0,very poor instruction brochure
6445,10,absolutely love this!! i can actually speak to the echo from upstairs to start playing my request.
6446,9,this echo works great thank you for this has changed  my life
6447,14,"i originally bought this to get into the smart home movement. what i found out after plugging alexa in was amazing. the echo is a tool to manage home electronics/electrical devices, keep grocery list, make calls, play games and listen to good quality music. my almost 5 year old loves ut as well."
6448,11,it is what it is
6449,12,"love it so far, used only 5% of things it can do!!"
6450,9,"got this for my uncles 89th birthday since he does not see very well, he can ask alexa anything about the weather, stocks, etc.  he greatly enjoys her interactive conversations, could not have gotten a better gift for him."
6451,3,love our echo.  it works well and is exactly as described.
6452,1,very cool. love it.
6453,14,a fabulous smart speaker which delivers surprisingly excellent sound for a small item.  easy to learn the routines and opportunities; we rely on it every day!
6454,10,"great set op, speakers are great"
6455,8,awesome product
6456,11,it is better now
6457,0,"came quick, price was right. works good but takes getting used to asking the right questions."
6458,10,great for your home
6459,10,i love our echo! we use it numerous times every day. informative and fun. we love the question of the day. quite glad we bought it
6460,1,i like the look and sound of the slim speaker. it is nice having music fill the room as well as having other information available.
6461,9,bought it for a gift for my dad took patience to learn but he loves it now use it every day. very nice sound
6462,0,speaker is great and the voice recognition is spot on. just wish it did more in terms of answering questions. you have to ask very direct questions like what is capital of iowa or how do you spell cat?  wish it could answer questions like why is there daylight savings time or how long till the new iphone comes out?
6463,2,love the echo.
6464,1,great sound and choices with music.
6465,11,like the improved sound and hands free operation. missing a personality and wittyness similar to siri.
6466,2,love my alexa
6467,10,"no one listens to me in my home, my two year old tells me no when i ask her to do something, so i am thrilled to have alexa. i feel rich !!! the echo has made such a difference. it has added another dimension to my home environment. i truly enjoy having it and i remain curious about what it can and cannot do"
6468,0,i love it. very convenient and it responds very quickly to voice commands.i love the fact that it is integrated with my spotify account.
6469,10,alexa answers all my questions when i ask pretty quickly and sound is amazing! plays music a instanlty and gives me my sports updates!
6470,14,excellent sound quality. takes some setup to get it working right with other echos but definitely a great tech toy.
6471,9,"this is a damn good product. will recommend to my friends, if i had some, lol..."
6472,1,its alexa. of course its great.
6473,11,much better sound reproduction than our original echo.
6474,1,impressive sound for such a small device.
6475,10,great addition to our household.  simple to get started and use.  i listen to the morning news and then play music for the rest of the day.
6476,7,"fun gadget - probably should take a little time and learn more features, but it is really nice for music, the weather and math and spelling questions. <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0082>"
6477,10,"has been a source of trivia, a go to for a news flash and weather, my 3 yr old grandchild is entertained and easy access to music. i am still investigating skills, today i discovered a find my phone skill and a meditation minute.  also gives you updates on when your amazon order will be delivered."
6478,0,i love asking for music when i feel like it. sound is very good.
6479,8,loooove this.
6480,3,great sound quality!
6481,10,was not sure if a really needed this. and i really do not need it but i love it!  even my wife who thinks my tech purchases are silly loves this thing.
6482,8,love love love!
6483,11,sound is amazing.  works well with the dots in the same house.
6484,9,i listen to music all day. this has really good sound quality.
6485,11,better voice clarity thank echo gen1.
6486,10,my wife uses it all the time.
6487,5,"son loves it, works great"
6488,0,"still quirky, often confused"
6489,5,i bought it as gift for a close friend and he loves it!
6490,9,great sound and all the great echo features all in one!
6491,0,music is great but answering questions is somewhat poor.  need to try and keep questions simple or ekse it is back to the computer to find an answer.
6492,0,"i am enjoying the echo.  sound is good.  sometimes it is hard to have alexa find a particular album from my library, but we are working on that."
6493,3,works as expected and sounds great.
6494,9,i am not a techie at all but this is a really fun device!  my brother gave it to me as a gift and i can not remember the last time i enjoyed a gift this much.  finding obscure songs from my childhood and all being able to do it hands free while doing other things was great!
6495,12,pretty slick.  we use it all the time.  cool gadget to have around.
6496,3,works as advertised!  we love it!
6497,2,love my alexa
6498,1,sleek design and is a great thing to have for music and family games! gets extremely loud.
6499,10,"we bought this just as a fun thing to have around and get answers to questions about history, geography, science, etc. and a lot of the questions we ask, alexa says sorry, i am not sure about that! so we are not real happy with it."
6500,9,i have to say this thing really does have great audio quality. i received an echo dot for xmas from a friend and instantly wanted another one so i went with the echo 2nd gen. this things gets way louder than the dot as expected. it has a rich and full sound that fills the room.
6501,10,easy to set up! wife absolutely loves it. just ask a question by saying alexa first and you get the needed information quickly. alexa play prince songs and off you go. you can even say alexa turn up the volume and it turns up. the kids are into it also. great item for amy home.
6502,5,bought as a present for my younger brother. he loves it
6503,0,"it does wait you want it to do sometimes but i still find,myself using the google because she can not find the answer or its wrong. would i purchase again, probably not."
6504,14,we really enjoy it!  i have listened to some music i have not heard since my record collection got stolen in college 30 years ago.
6505,0,need to improve a lot.  sometimes it informs nothing related to what is being asked.  not all available skills are useful.
6506,10,very useful for daily reminders
6507,0,what is not to love?!
6508,14,dont trust her. she or cia is always listening. oh and randomly laughs which is fun lol
6509,0,"the echo does the basics but alexa still seems to be clueless on many subjects (i.e. i asked hear a particular song be played, she played a version that sounded poor like a live show, so i asked her to play studio version and she could not do so).  the echo is kind of fun but not really what i expected."
6510,9,love my echo and echo dot! they have helped me manage my daily life in a much more efficient way!
6511,1,works and sounds great
6512,5,she loves it
6513,7,thank you <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+008a>
6514,1,good product
6515,3,"i live in the bahamas. because of geographical restrictions, this serves no purpose here!"
6516,12,i am still getting used to using it.
6517,14,i love the ability to be able to handle things through my voice. i love this echo. i am more apt to play music as it is so simple to initiate it.
6518,10,we love this !!! we ask and get the weather report. and lots of other fun facts
6519,8,alexa is wonderful
6520,10,i love playing music from my echo. i am still finding out what my echo can do. just need to take the time to play with it.
6521,1,gear product
6522,10,this is a great thing to have it made several thing easier around the house
6523,1,the sound quality is very good
6524,14,"it is fun, the more you work with her(alexa) the more you will find yourself doing. works well with my hue hub, and has helped turn lights off & on."
6525,10,love having alexa give my briefing and play my pandora.
6526,12,still learning what she can do
6527,1,good sound quality
6528,14,"used more when it was new. was kind of a novelty. i feel she lacks ""answers"" since she uses wikipedia instead of google. i use it mostly  now for daily reminders. i have a dot as well, so sometimes  use as intercoms."
6529,11,very pleased. especially like the fabric look.
6530,1,excellent product
6531,0,"sound is surprisingly good, but tends to have a mind of its own sometimes"
6532,0,"maybe i have a glitchy one, but it is about 50/50 when i ask it to play any artist is specific album. and, i have amazon music. when i go to the app i can see all of the artist is albums when i type in a search. but, alexa can not seem to find it if i ask her. it is a bit annoying."
6533,14,"when playing music, it does around 10 songs and then quits and growls and i must unplug from wall to stop the grind and then it reboots andshuts down.  on positive side it has great sounds and quick answers to what alexa is asked."
6534,1,sound quality is quite good.
6535,14,"i love the new look! that was key with me, because i did not want a black plastic tower taking focus from my room decor. but, had i known how much fun and how super the sound was i would have gotten one earlier! i use it everyday for music, and quite often for all the other things it can do."
6536,10,plays music with ease. turns lites on and off.alexa answers just about anything.  gets the news for you in the morning.
6537,0,"it is interesting, but does not seem to be very useful for us.  cannot get music without signing up for additional services at additional expense, asked questions usually get a response of ""i do not know"" for ""i do not understand"".  thought it would be more fun and informative."
6538,11,the echo (2nd generation) works great.
6539,0,"what i like the most is that i can listen to the music i like whenever i want to listen.what i like least is the trial and error or finding the ""right"" music.  at this point there are limitations.  guess i will learnhow to use it fully soon."
6540,2,my new friend
6541,9,i love this device! great for playing all of our favorite music in more than one room when we use it with our echo dot.
6542,14,this thing is bringing an eighty year old into the twenty first century. i can not help laughing every time alexa and i have a chat. absolutly love it.
6543,14,"i haven/t been able to synchronize it with wifi, followed directions but no luck.  do not know who to call."
6544,1,love the echo! first time using alexa was easy and fun. the streaming music library is amazing. would recommend this product for everyone.
6545,4,"the echo has been absolutely amazing, great product and very user friendly!"
6546,12,"the sound is wonderful and am still learning how to use it, otherwise, i absolutely love it"
6547,12,so far it has been great
6548,5,great christmas gift!
6549,12,we¡¯re enjoying our new echo.
6550,14,still working on it
6551,14,keeps dropping wifi
6552,1,nice box that sound incredible
6553,1,"nice sound, works very well with my tp- link switches."
6554,12,i learn something new on it everyday.  we enjoy it.
6555,12,still getting used to it.  sounds exceedingly great.
6556,10,"i love my new echo i received for christmas. everything i thought and more! love being able to say ""play music"" and alexa finds what i want. also love hearing the thought of the day, what happen on this day in history and local weather by just asking the question. really a neat addition to the home."
6557,12,so much fun
6558,11,"i like the looks of the outer skin and the texture.  the sound was very surprising, i also have the first ¡®tall¡¯ echo and the dot"
6559,2,i love alexa!
6560,0,spoken word is great on these but some songs have problems. but what i use the echo for it is great.
6561,1,great sound for a small device!
6562,1,quality product and service!
6563,14,"great sound for a small speaker. the new fabric makes the appearance better. i set up two at the office in a group, so the same music can play in both rooms when desired."
6564,0,it is difficult to start - i need to repeat myself at least 5 times with the alexa command before it plays my musical selection request - so far i am not 'delighted'.
6565,12,love it more & more each day!
6566,1,having a blast with our echo.  alexa actually has a quirky sense of humor.  great quality sound.  just as a speaker it is worth the money.
6567,14,still having problems syncing it. pandora was a no brainer but for movies and books?
6568,8,love it love it love it
6569,4,"easy to set up, easy to use. no negatives."
6570,11,bass is on point
6571,14,"great dolby sound. my husband, who has difficulty hearing women is voices, has no problem hearing alexa or for that matter any other sound coming from echo. i do not see any downside to it except it is size, but that has to be expected for the sound it produces."
6572,6,"meh. alexa often confuses ""play billy joel on spotify"" for ""slay bloopity bleep bloop on mopify"". we have fun."
6573,5,got this as a gift for my sister. she loves it
6574,4,"nice product, easy to set up"
6575,2,"love, love, love!!¡¯"
6576,14,"liked everything about the echo, it was easy to install an works perfectly"
6577,11,"love echo.  the 2nd gen has much better audio.  however, i miss the ring on the top for volume control (like the 1st gen), rather than using the +- buttons.  just a preference."
6578,2,we love our alexa!
6579,14,sound keeps dropping down?
6580,14,my mom loves it. only reason i give it 4 stars is the price dropped by the time i got it
6581,10,all went well
6582,3,worked as advertised
6583,14,"i got this as a christmas gift and it was asome, exactly how it was detail on descriptions. bad side is downloading apps for music, some app does not have all song to listen to. but overall great device."
6584,0,it does not understand playlist i want to name my own playlist  like playlist 123and when  the  alexa says it understands come back in an hour or 15 minutes and ask it  play alexa  play list 123. then i ask it to play playlist 123 and it says it does not exist.
6585,1,great sound and excellent response to inquiries.
6586,8,just love it!
6587,3,as advertised
6588,11,"looks nicer than the original. the sound is pretty good, just wish it had little more bass."
6589,10,it is an amazing gadget. i love it. it has a ton of uses.
6590,11,"slower, does not hear me as well.does not work as great as dot."
6591,10,great to have her around the house.
6592,10,"it is like having another best friend. alexa will keep you on schedule, compile your shopping list, keep you on time for those appointments as well as tell you a joke to make you laugh. her capabilities seem to be endless. you just have to think it out loud and she makes it happen. i love it!"
6593,4,setup was easy.  love it!
6594,1,good sound.
6595,4,works as advertised.
6596,3,arrived on time. love this
6597,9,i use it primarily for music. i think it is great.
6598,8,we love it
6599,4,works great
6600,14,"i am very satisfied with my echo purchase.  the only concern that i have with the echo is that it seems like it is smarter than i am.  hopefully, i will miraculously get a better feel for it as time passes, but it is a lots of fun even if you do not know much yet."
6601,8,love it!!!
6602,12,it was a gift.  getting used to it.
6603,3,as advertised
6604,13,alexa is the greatest
6605,14,"works great, only issue- it picks up conversations and comes on, otherwise it is great, plays whatever requested."
6606,14,set up easy an intuitive. sounds very nice. ordered music unlimited for the one echo device for $3.99 per month right on the echo verbally. just say ¡°sign up for amazon music unlimited¡± and it does it.
6607,0,"echo is cool, but i wish it was capable of better internet searching. if it does not know the answer to a question i would like for it to do the search for me rather than just say i dont know that."
6608,10,we love the all- new echo.  it answers your questions immediately.  this is still new to us so we are learning as we go.  the music is beautiful.
6609,14,"setup issue, had to return"
6610,11,needs improvements
6611,14,"it is a good speaker to have but the sound lacks low frequency base. also, it randomly turns on by itself and it feels it is listening when it is not supposed to."
6612,9,used as present
6613,0,"i loved its many options and functions. it is a fun tool and well worth the price. however, it is occationally confused voice recognition, limited bluetooth range and what seems like a small selection of commands are all small problems. it is good, but not ""great"" product. i love it, nevertheless."
6614,0,a good new toy to play with.  it has a way to go yet - more skills needed.  it sometimes has a hard time turning off/on the lights via voice command.  i need to use the cell phone app sometimes to perform the commands when the voice does not work.
6615,4,"great sound, easy to use, fantastic toy!"
6616,1,excellent product
6617,10,"so convenient. alexa will play music, set alarms and turn on/off my lights. what did i do before my echo?"
6618,1,works great
6619,10,love it great listening to music and asking alexa give me information lot of fun
6620,0,i am still getting used to it sometimes it turns on its self but i really like it
6621,9,love alexa and all new features for my home control.
6622,5,it was a gift and recipient stated it was awesome.
6623,11,"nice compact size, good fidelity and volume. does not have the manual volume adjustment ring of the original echo, though."
6624,1,the sound is amazing for such a small device.
6625,1,awesome!  sound awesome  looks awesome
6626,8,love it!!!
6627,14,"we love the sound quality and handiness, but had only one problem.  we had blue light lock in on mode, and could not get her to shut down without unplugging her.  is there a solution?"
6628,14,disappointed. does not know a lot of things and likes to use wikipedia as it is reference. was initially excited but rarely use it now. use it mostly for the speaker which unfortunately has a high bass but i have to utilize it somehow.
6629,10,i can play other internet station.great sound.easy to use.
6630,14,multi-room audio is unstable. voice commands are very picky about structure. routines do not seem to work with all the kinds of devices that individual commands can.
6631,1,great sound in a small machine. love it!
6632,3,it does everything
6633,5,this was a christmas gift for my daughter and her family. i understand they love it and enjoy it is use
6634,8,we love this.
6635,1,great sound.  i love the look and functionality.
6636,0,"i like the ease of adding to my lists and i love the music ability.  however often times alexa blurts out nonsense without being prompted and she is not always able to answer my questions or respond to requests to search something. i get a lot of ""sorry i do not know that."""
6637,0,"she is not as smart as google. she does not know alot is there some way to make her smarter. when i google things on my phone, there is always an answer. but with alexa, she does not have many answer is for us."
6638,12,love this item - use it for so many things!
6639,3,arrived on time. as described.
6640,11,i like the color choices and the fact that it is shorter than gen 1 models. the echo is still as responsive and loud as the first
6641,3,just what i expected/wanted
6642,12,still learning but useful household device.
6643,10,"start the day with alexa, weather report, classical music"
6644,1,a fun toy
6645,9,great unit.
6646,14,"i fell in love with the speaker and alexa so quickly that i could not best the thought of exchanging it.  i should have went with the tap instead of echo.  i move it to different rooms with me, so a portable option would have been a better fit."
6647,9,i am enjoying the echo (2nd generation).  i have paired it with smart plugs throughout our home and it works great.
6648,5,"bought as a gift, but love the echo"
6649,5,great gift!
6650,4,"works great, very easy to set up."
6651,11,really love the sound on this speaker.the gray fabric cover looks awesome too.
6652,11,new echo is a nice upgrade to the first version. sound is nice and clear and echo gives a perfect feeling for the rest of my echo devices. the grey color is a looker.
6653,1,this is great fun!
6654,12,its versatility
6655,14,plan to use this in our new mountain home instead of a complicated wiring system that breaks down.  been there/done that.  the sound is great and will possibky be even better by the time our home is completed.
6656,7,"oh yas babe , i love it <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+008a>"
6657,14,quick delivery. set up easy. only issue i have and it is vanity- alexa will not call or refer to me by name. it is very specific and literal when understanding commands or requests. great speaker. overall i love it. have hooked up my tv  and several lights/ceiling fans with it.
6658,10,"it is  awesome love to listen to mucic,traffic, news and weather.  works great"
6659,10,"love it , now just installing accessories"
6660,5,love them ~ everyone got an echo this year for x-mas!
6661,9,best gift of the holiday!
6662,1,love it ! great sound ! !
6663,10,this is great.  we love it.. it connected to all the plugs  we. have. and it is great for up to date weather.  our granddughter loves to get it to play music so she can dance!
6664,10,a great time saver. i do not have to grab my phone every time i want to make a call. answer to questions are quick and easy.become awake during lexus commercials.
6665,10,i enjoy listening to music and searching for information using alexa.  i also enjoy the jeopardy challenge and her morning greetings.
6666,8,love it!!
6667,9,we love her
6668,0,hate that it is not wireless.it is 2018 i feel like amazon needs to step it up. also i am hispanic and although i do listen to a lot of english music i also ask for spanish music and she does not ever understand. also wish it would connect with itunes. needs improvement. more music options.
6669,9,i have two echo and one dot.........they are great. one of my best purchases in amazon and i have bought a lot of stuff.
6670,10,"we like our echo, especially it is music capabilities."
6671,11,"works good just like the dot. music sounds better than the dot. speech is sometimes harder to understand than the dot. i wish it had some control over the bass and treble or a button to flip, or speak, to listen to music or speech. we are happy with what we can do with it and use it a lot."
6672,0,"good sound for music. responds well to basic, simple commands.confused responses to many questions/commands. music stops playing after 2 or 3 songs.requires purchase of many other items to use all of the features.still learning how to use it effectively."
6673,10,"i love it!  because i can ask almost anything and alexa always has the answer.. i can sometimes even feel like i am not living alone and can talk to ""alexa"" whenever i want to...!  :)"
6674,4,very happy with the product. easy set up and plenty of apps to add to the echo. sound quality is good for its size.
6675,9,"i love it! i have the echo dot (2nd generation) which i got as a xmas present, i loved it so much that decided to get this one. she is ¡°alexa¡± very helpful.! :)"
6676,12,still trying to figure out how to get the lights integrated with it but all in all i love my gift
6677,1,works well
6678,5,he echo is outstanding.
6679,1,excellent
6680,0,"sometimes stops playing music for no reason, cant find skills sometimes.... i enjoy it but thats annoying... lastly should have a rechargeable battery the fact that its always tethered almost kills the whole idea."
6681,0,it speaks for itself.
6682,12,"i like it, but alexa still had a lot to learn"
6683,11,great audio
6684,1,amazing sound quality!
6685,9,what a great item to have in your house. endless possibilities for what ever you want to know. the music sound is much more than what i thought it would be. i take it into the garage whilie i am working there.
6686,0,"works great, really useful for when i need to know what time it is or the weather but i dont know where my phone is. does disconnect from wifi a little often though"
6687,1,we love it!  it is awesome.  great addition to the family.
6688,1,very convenient and responsive
6689,8,i love this! i
6690,5,wife loves it
6691,3,exactly what i expected
6692,11,"great product, good sound improved look and size now have one of each generation. like the new reduced price"
6693,4,simply fabulous
6694,8,love it.
6695,8,love it!
6696,8,love it.
6697,14,other then a little complicated for the novice to set up. we fun playing with it.
6698,8,love it!
6699,8,i use it everyday.
6700,14,these things are awesome!
6701,8,love it!
6702,14,i love all of these products.  i own several.  i have it connected to my smart home system and audio and video.
6703,5,love it. great price
6704,11,"annoying. less than helpful. sound quality not what amazon builds it up to be. all in all, marginally worth the money."
6705,14,fun! full of useless as well as useful info.
6706,14,love the echo...and am now looking at other applications that work with it...
6707,9,"very fun to use, sound quality is on point, games such as jeopardy and trivia are great for group get togethers. highly recommended for any techie or someone who enjoys keeping their lives organized on a daily basis. bought one for tmnt friend and dad after receiving mine!"
6708,14,i liked the convenience of asking for a music selection.  i hated that my husband unplugged it every time i started speaking about anything we would prefer to stay private.  i hate that they admittedly monitor and listen in.  what a waste of money
6709,8,works great love it.
6710,8,we love this! great sound!
6711,2,sound is great!  exceeded my expectations.
6712,11,so far so good. 10 times the sound over the dot.
6713,11,love the speaker quality.  matched with amazon music this cannot be best!  this has taken the place of my old bluetooth sound bar.  we have recommended this to many many people already!!
6714,14,"easy to set up, volumn and all the functions of alexa from reminders to music.like least :  in another room and mention ¡®alexa ¡® name and she¡¯ll answer.  kinda creepy!"
6715,14,so far not very happy. cannot connect to my wifi. really frustrating.
6716,14,"to those that have had trouble-as we did-setting up a new device that was purchased as a gift, the attached directions fixed it perfectly for us. hope this helps!!"
6717,2,i love this echo!
6718,1,i really like the size and sound of this echo. we are very pleased with this purchase
6719,0,"works sporadically, more questions not answered than answered. sometime there is no response"
6720,14,"like most others, i am very disappointed in the sound quality for playing music even after the software update.  hopefully, amazon will provide another software update that significantly improves the sound quality or replace the unit with one that really does have good sound quality.  for people who want to listen to music, i would suggest purchasing an echo dot and using the price difference to buy a good bluetooth speaker to pair with the echo dot.** warning - for some reason, it seems like echo is not easily pairing with other bluetooth speakers.  i bought a great bose bluetooth speaker that paired easily with all my other bluetooth devices, but for some reason, would not pair with the new echo.  i am returning the echo 2nd gen."
6721,1,love it and the sound is decent
6722,14,items did not work and took forever to receive a replacement.
6723,11,small enough but great
6724,12,love alexia! i am learing how to better understand & use this device !
6725,11,"had the first generation echo and it was good, ordered the new second generation and it is even better. shorter and wider design and better sound speaker."
6726,10,"this echo has great sound quality!  it is a little thumper for sure.  great for creating reminders, shopping lists or just wanting to hear random songs or stations from amazon music.  kids play 20 questions with it lol"
6727,12,it has been easy to use and fun to learn what it can do.
6728,14,"good sound, can hear me from many rooms in house, can not always answer questions as well as google"
6729,3,as advertised. excellent
6730,11,"works much better than my 1st gen, but does seem to have more trouble with my husband is accent than the 1st gen did. overall, i am much happier with the size and look of this one."
6731,10,i really enjoy have this as part odf my new kitchen.  for the little bit have asked of it.....it has been great.  i do not spend a lot of time at home so slowly discovering more about it.  make a great timer on the fly and plays my music while i bake.  more rooms come...
6732,0,great to have around the house
6733,8,love it and use it everyday!
6734,14,"the sound quality is amazing.  no real need to get additional speakers.  choice of music is both very broad and limited, but overall we are very happy we bought this product."
6735,14,"maybe it is an app thing, but i can not connect this to my daughter is phone once it established connection to my account.  set up is vague.  it mught be a great device, but i would not know."
6736,3,everything i expected!
6737,10,i use alexa for everything. from my shopping list to the weather updates.
6738,14,sounds great and works awesome when used as a satellite speaker when hooked up to multiple rooms.
6739,1,very fun for the whole family
6740,10,really love this thing ! changes the way i spend time in kitchen. like a personal assistant
6741,1,great product. clear sound!
6742,10,i love listening to music. i ask alexa for the temperature outside and she answers.
6743,0,"love alexa, but sometimes it gives me the wrong information, but i still love it, perfect little assistance especially if you add lots of accessories with it. not that i have it, it feels like i can not live without it. love it."
6744,11,love this echo but it needs more bass
6745,1,echo is awesome. lots of fun and really enjoy the music
6746,10,amazing
6747,10,"still learning all her tricks, but really enjoying using her. love the shopping list option!!"
6748,1,perfect
6749,14,it has a few glitches but i am trying to work with it.  i wonder if the google home would have these problems.
6750,14,did not work
6751,10,i got this for my husband and we love it! it can make a grocery list or order things off amazon. this can do so much and make a busy life more manageable. it is kind of like having an assistant.
6752,4,fun to use.
6753,0,"i received the echo as a present.  i  do not think i needed it but i am giving it a try.  at this point i mostly ask about today is weather and maybe a few other questions.  just not really excited about it.by the way my friend has alexa and says that it is her ""best friend""."
6754,4,"simply love it great volume, easy to setup, i definitely recommend this product."
6755,5,this was a christmas gift for my daughter and her entire family loves using it.
6756,12,this is a great product with more uses all the time
6757,11,"love the amazon echo speakers, the 2nd gen unit has noticeably more bass & better sound than gen 1.  the design is also an improvement over the original echo speaker."
6758,11,i love the echo. it picks up my voice from across the room and the speakers fill up the whole house.
6759,0,returned
6760,10,whoa what great addition to any room. sound quality is superior to other products.
6761,1,i love the sound quality from this echo
6762,9,alexa is hilarious!
6763,1,great sound for music
6764,5,great gift for my wife is birthday! she just loves it!
6765,0,"alexa is great fun, playing most of my songs requested.  she is fairly intelligent regarding questions we ask her but not all the time.  have not spent the time yet to have her make grocery lists or text people but will do that soon.  overall we are very pleased with the echo."
6766,8,just love it
6767,5,my parents gave it to me and my husband for christmas. we love it.
6768,12,love the versatility of this product! been fun learning about it and all the possibilities!
6769,9,"yes, and we love it!"
6770,0,i enjoy the music. alexa does not always understand even if she responded the first time and understood. can be frustrating.
6771,2,"love love, love alexa"
6772,0,do not buy this.alexa question  does the  work. you say 15 times it works. do not waste ur money.
6773,0,does not answer many questions. get more out of google on my phone. very disappointed. maybe returning if no solution.
6774,9,i love it best christmas gift i got this year! i can not say enough about it.
6775,14,good stuff
6776,11,top notch sound quality. giving command is easy and alexa can hear you from a few rooms away.
6777,14,"i find that it does not have the ability to search for information as much as i would like.  it is pretty good at playing music from pandora, etc.  it was a gift so i did not do any research first about the product so perhaps my expectations were high."
6778,10,love it but wondering about how much i am exposing myself to being tracked.
6779,4,set up was easy and works works better we expected
6780,10,she answers most questions we have.  she can change our thermostat and plays our favorite tunes.
6781,2,love my alexa.
6782,4,great product
6783,11,"the sound is definitely a little better than the first gen model, and the unit is smaller and blends in easier."
6784,0,i do not know what we did before alexia.  she is like part of the family.
6785,8,love it
6786,5,great christmas gift!
6787,12,i love what alexa can do
6788,10,great product.  i use echo mainly to play music and update news and its been great.  i look forward to doing more with the echo in the future.
6789,14,thanks
6790,4,good sound and pickup. easy to use. great timesaver.
6791,12,i have been very happy with this! no problems at all.
6792,11,"i truly enjoy the echo 2nd generation. it is fun, efficient, and helpful."
6793,10,enjoy it everyday
6794,14,"unfortunately it took a total of 2 weeks, the efforts of a computer expert and the 1.5 hr. efforts of a comcast representative to get alexa up and running.  there are areas of intellectual weakness.  additionally folks need to learn how to ask questions of alexa ""the right way""."
6795,9,the entire family loves it. worth every penny.
6796,1,very entertaining
6797,14,still not great sound quality
6798,1,my new echo is wonderful! the music quality is very good.
6799,8,love it
6800,1,sounds great!!
6801,1,very good.
6802,11,i do not think the speaker is on par with the original
6803,2,love my alexa/echo
6804,10,i can turn my bedroom lights on.  i can play my favorite songs.  it is so handy.
6805,10,"meets my expectations, still working on what i can ask it. use it to play music or xm radio through my house."
6806,4,"we love alexa! easy to set up, easy to use and very entertaining!"
6807,14,"i did not get the first generation echo because the concept was so new to me and i just did not know if i would use it enough. now with more experience using voice-controlled products, things i had issues with have been addressed.<u+2014> set up <u+2014>set up is easy. plug in and turn on your echo. download ¡®alexa app¡¯ from your phone is app store, and sign in with your amazon account. it will tell you to connect to the amazon wifi network the echo generates. once connected, the echo configures itself and you can start using it.if you have amazon music or audible, your accounts are automatically connected and will play what music/book you request.<u+2014> customizable covers <u+2014>you can now choose between six amazon covers to match your environment! changing it is as simple as pressing the release button on the bottom and sliding it out to switch. this opens the door for third-party manufacturers to create all sorts of designs. top marks for customization.<u+2014> speakers <u+2014>wow, amazon was not kidding when they said ¡°room-filling sound.¡± its one woofer and tweeter is powerful enough to enjoy your music casually. the keyword here is casually. if you own one of those portable speakers, this echo is a nice upgrade in terms of sound quality. however, it does not compare to a dedicated audio system, and should not be compared as such.the volume is comfortable around 60%. the bass does not seem to kick in until it is at 75% volume. this would make the perfect kitchen speaker when cooking; you can listen to your audio while cooking!<u+2014> alexa <u+2014>for the most part, alexa understands most of what i say as long as i start any request with ¡°alexa.¡±i¡¯ve learned that for most listening devices it is best to choose words with multiple syllables when naming things. example: alexa has a difficult time finding my ¡°cloud playlist,¡± but can easily find, ¡°cloudy cloud playlist.¡± so instead of trying to repeat the instruction, just rename your things.the most surprising thing is alexa can understand when i¡¯m trying to talk to her when the speaker is on high volume. i do not even have to shout! i was testing the volume at which she could hear me over loud music, from my normal volume to a whisper, and she could hear me. it can only be described as magic.<u+2014> things to ask <u+2014>i have not tested the full capabilities of alexa, so i have only asked the typical things: what is the weather, play this playlist, play this audiobook, tell me a joke, convert this measurement to this, set an alarm to wake me up. one nice thing is the alexa app keeps a record of the things you have asked for future reference.<u+2014> drop in <u+2014>i wanted to talk about this new feature. ""drop in"" basically allows you to listen in on the echo remotely. it is kind of like having a remote video security system<u+2014>but only hearing audio. the device itself will give out a noise to indicate it is doing this, and then you can listen in remotely. i can only imagine how people will use this, ya know what i mean?<u+2014> the future of echo <u+2014>i¡¯m trying to figure out what they could improve for future versions as i¡¯m hard-pressed to find anything. customization, check. volume, check. design, check. i guess a premium audio model could be nice. i think with amazon is wide range of echo products, you¡¯ll find one that will suit your lifestyle. this one is more geared towards people who like to listen to audio (no need for a screen).<u+2014> summary <u+2014>i¡¯m enjoying my echo. it is amazing how far audio recognition and machine learning has come so far. it is making me debate whether i want one with a screen in the future. if you like to listen to audio without having to touch anything, the echo is a great device. recommended."
6808,10,"the sound is great with a lot of base .  i use it for music, weather reports, sport scores and as my alarm clock.  the only thing that i do not like is that i have multiple echos and sometimes my daughter is echo will stream into my unit but our rooms are close together."
6809,3,the sound is amazing.....thank you...
6810,14,so far we have been unable to get it connected
6811,0,i love it. i like bing able to call people and not have to use my phone. better than i expected. have not explored everything yet but anxious to do so.
6812,12,still working w/it. love it so far
6813,10,such a joy
6814,14,works great.fun to use. found others cheaper ...later.guess all echoes will get cheaper.
6815,14,i love the echo very much..so easy to use. i wish it had some directions with it to explain what certain things mean when there are different colors that circle around the rim. it gets easier each day.
6816,10,i like it for easy access to musical selections for my voice students
6817,9,"i had received the echo dot for christmas, i love it but needed something a lil more louder. bought myself the echo an i absolutely love it! powerful speaker, can sync to my dot an now can hear my music loud an clear thruout the house while cleaning. love love love it! highly recommend!!"
6818,8,love it
6819,14,i like how easy it is to give commands and receiva a prompt response. it is nice to easily request whatever choice of music one desires. also the capabilities of the echo are amazing.
6820,10,i have all the alexa devices! love them all!
6821,10,the best echo yet!
6822,0,"a little sad alexa is only programmed in english. i took her home to holland and she just is not the way she was when i got to know her in the usa. besides, because of my accent she often does not understand me what i am asking. i am pretty much disappointed with the echo."
6823,1,works great
6824,10,the sound is wonderful. love it. wish it could send recipes to my email or phone.
6825,14,great. replacing my google
6826,8,my kids love it!
6827,14,"considerable improvement over the original echo, especially in terms f sound quality.  that coupled with more enhancements, e.g., all device sound and drop-in capability makes alexa even more useful.  friends marvel at the system coupled with tp link smart devices when they visit my home!"
6828,10,"it is fun to play around with.  i do not have much wi-fi set up for it yet so when i do i think i will like it more.  it does not recognize ski resorts.  when i ask about the snow conditions at sugar bowl ski resort, she gives me information about the sugar bowl football games."
6829,0,convenient for lists and questions. unfortunately some songs that i thought i would be able to hear are only available on music unlimited
6830,0,i didnt know i needed to purchase a service to listen to the songs i want to listen to. maybe im using the machine wrong but i tried everything i could to make it work.
6831,5,made a great gift.
6832,11,"works as expected, it can hear my voice throughout my entire first floor."
6833,0,glitches and does not change ambient sounds.  sometimes does not respond.
6834,9,what fun and so much information at the sound of your voice. ordered a dot for the kitchen.
6835,9,my wife loves it cause it plays her music whenever she wants. great buy!
6836,10,"i love being able to use voice commands and being ""hand is free"" when using the echo."
6837,10,alexa is my new bff & probably the best christmas present i have received to date. i love that she is constantly improving based on feedback and her ability to make my life a bit easier.
6838,9,easy to use. everyone enjoys using it from a 7 years old to a 73 year old.
6839,5,it was a gift!
6840,8,great item.
6841,5,i love her my family loves her
6842,7,"best present ever!!! we are having such fun with it<f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+008a>even us old  folks can get the info we want easily.  music, reminders, weather, etc. thanks kids!"
6843,12,"love it so far, just trying to learn all that it can do."
6844,3,works fine
6845,10,"easy set up, lot is of great features and fun to use. i love it, buying another one!"
6846,1,"great price , awesome product!"
6847,14,i like the sound quality for such and in expensive unit.  i do not like that it is not as intuitive and i thought it would be.  biggest thing i would like to see especially when coupled with amazon music if for alexa to be able to add songs to play lists by voice command.
6848,5,it was a gift
6849,10,"alexa answers most of my questions, plays my favorite music, keeps my calendar updated. i really do not have anything negative to report."
6850,1,just love it. the sound is incredible
6851,1,quality of sound is great for such a small device.
6852,10,i received the echo as a christmas gift and it is my first experience with this type of product. love listening to music and ability to get a quick weather report. we are very happy with alexa!
6853,14,"it was easy to set up, transport to other locations and use.  sound quality is excellent.  loved the depth of functions you can perform with alexa.can you possible add the ability to provide audible newspapers?thank you for a great reasonably priced product."
6854,0,"liked the sound very much.  had difficulty for some reason connecting to the internet.  once things connected, we have been happy"
6855,10,love my alexa! we actually have 3 in different parts of our home. very convenient when getting ready for work & quickly inquiring regarding that day is weather. really nice sound quality for listening to music.
6856,14,"i have nothing to compare it to.  this is my first.  it does anything i have asked it to do-increase/decrease volume, turn light on/off, play music by specific artists to requested musicyears.  i am very pleased."
6857,2,"sound is great, love the interaction. alexa is the bomb."
6858,0,i like the size. music sounds great but she is not very smart.  i half to revert to google on my phone alot.
6859,0,"the newness wears off overtime, but its still cool and nice to have"
6860,0,does the job
6861,14,"works pretty well.  there is a lot of setup needed, or at least more than i thought.  it is kind of a pain for shopping lists to have to manually delete them in the app.  but overall a good experience."
6862,12,love it. still learning how to use. music sounds are wonderful.
6863,1,works great sounds great
6864,14,"if i hear ""i do not know that"" one more time, i am doing an office space on this thing."
6865,14,amazon called me and in three minutes they helped me get this second echo to work. its is to amazon is credit that they took the time to understand user issues and feed them back to development team. this is definitely the future way we will interface with computers at home.
6866,10,we love alexa! all our kids have alarms and reminders for their daily routines. we have a lot of fun with the different skills and it replaced our stereo system!another favorite feature is that i can ¡°call ¡° my kids and they can call me!
6867,14,we really like the alexa unit. we learn new things all the time about its capabilities. this is the 2nd unit though. the 1st unit stopped working after a month and was exchanged.  so we are keeping our fingers crossed that this one goes on for a long time. it is state of the art and looks good.
6868,11,speaker is way better than the first gen echo. can not beat the price! fabric covering/sleeve is high quality. nice and modern feel. alexa of course is amazing
6869,14,love it. only problem is that i am having trouble getting it to sync with my eco show to play music
6870,9,"this is the first echo i have had and i am really enjoying it, i bought a dot for another room."
6871,9,i love my echo! i am considering buying several just to have one throughout my house.
6872,0,i do not know a lot about electronics and probably do not even know all that alexa can do but i sure do enjoy alexa. the music and being able to message other people i know with alexa is great. i gave one to each of my children for christmas and they are really happy with their alexa is.
6873,1,item arrived quick. love it!
6874,0,it is fun. i use it mostly for playing music. alexa can not answer all my questions but i think it is definitely worth having. not a must have but a fun toy
6875,14,we had al little trouble pairing it to the wfi and bluetooth but we love the echo. we have been requesting a lot of christmas music.
6876,5,purchased this as a christmas gift for my mom and she loves it.
6877,8,love it
6878,1,"great sound, alexa!"
6879,14,"love this thing!!!  i use it for just about everything....music, recipe finder, turning my lights on and off,...dimming."
6880,9,we are in love with this echo.
6881,0,"it is fun and interesting, also helpful. some things i have not been able to figure out but i will with time."
6882,9,love my alexa!
6883,1,i like alexa .. very cool..
6884,1,very good
6885,14,nice
6886,0,gift
6887,8,love alexa
6888,11,improved sound over the echo dot.
6889,10,enjoy hearing a variety of music the most
6890,9,i never knew i needed one till i got one
6891,1,solid sound. good alexa
6892,14,well pleased so far.
6893,10,this was a gift so i was not sure it was for me.  i have amazon prime so the music and radios are great to ask for any genre of music or talk radio.
6894,0,fun to interact with.  alexa almost seems to have a personality. convenient information center.  i have not tried the home control capabilities yet.
6895,8,"wonderful, we love it"
6896,11,"i do like the way alexa hears me ,my voice commands recognition are great. i do have to say compared to the sound on my other echo the larger the sound is not as nearly as good as good ,have to say i was quite disappointed"
6897,0,i love
6898,14,i was used to my kids accidentally calling me by their teachers name...now they accidentally call me alexa... yep she is part of the family now for sure.i 'm also glad  she is proficient in math.thanks a lot amazon!
6899,11,smaller than the first generation version (a bit wider but shorter) and a very nice fabric exterior. sound quality is good overall and with very good listening capabilities. it identifies my voice across the room even when playing music or with the tv on.
6900,3,great product!!!!
6901,11,"i have four amazon echo devices and all are great. no complaints. the  echo 2nd generation, is a smaller form factor, but still great sound."
6902,9,"this is, without a doubt, one of my best purchases, ever! the sound it delivers is amazing! i will purchase this again as a gift for others!"
6903,0,she tells good jokes
6904,11,good sound but could be better
6905,10,i love it! i¡¯m able to listen al my favorite music in english and spanish. all this without getting up from my chair.  just started there is a lot to set up.  i¡¯m enjoying it!
6906,9,she is awesome and always has an answer and the music i play out of is crystal clear
6907,7,<f0><u+009f><u+0091><u+008d><f0><u+009f><u+0091><u+008d><f0><u+009f><u+0091><u+008d>
6908,1,great product
6909,11,this is my second amazon echo. my first one was the 1st generation. i lost that one to a fire. i think the sound quality is better on the 2nd gen. it fills the room with sound. i also love how it can control smart devices.
6910,0,"love, love, love this!!! sounds is great and she understand what i am saying!! much better than siri!! 10 stars from me!!"
6911,3,as described
6912,9,this is my first echo so i really had nothing to compare it to.  we have been quite pleased with how it works and the sound quality. we primarily use this for playing music in our kitchen -- works nicely.
6913,14,"well i will tell it is a blast for a 82 year old.it will take me a little while to where i know what to ask.but with your e mails it helps a lot,the suggestions are fun.at this point i give alexa a a"
6914,2,"love my echo and alexa, grey is a perfection"
6915,14,got this as a christmas gift. has great sound and is loud enough to fill the room where i keep it. music sounds great. the skills that you can get from the alexa app are pretty cool and i am consistently finding new things to try with alexa. i am going to start automating lighting in the house next.
6916,8,i love it it is wonderful.
6917,10,love it.  looks great and it is getting smarter by the day.
6918,8,"excellent , love it ."
6919,5,best christmas present ....
6920,2,i love my alexa!
6921,11,"works great, hope it lasts a while."
6922,10,"a birthday present and i am really enjoying it. music, weather, information and much more that we have not explored yet."
6923,9,i do not use her much but she is awesome in our family we love music so amazon prime thank you so much for my echo 2nd generation i hope it holds up as much as everyone says it does that is my main concern thank you so so very much for alexa you are so awesome of course she thanks me
6924,14,"the device did not meet our expectations. we did not believe, after a couple of days of use, that we would use it or that it would be useful to us if we did use it. the technology was excellent and met our expectations; however, it is not a device that we wanted to use."
6925,1,great sound.
6926,11,love the wood look finish!
6927,1,trhtrhrrthrthre
6928,0,i like that you can dictate what it plays and usually your requests are met. my problem is that i do not think about using it like i should!
6929,9,i am so loving my echo - alexa 2nd generation.  it was a christmas present from my son in law and daughter.  best present ever .  alexa is a blast to have.
6930,14,the relative ease to start using
6931,8,love this product!
6932,14,"i love playing with this device!  after reading some of the reviews, i read that there was a software update to improve the speaker sound....would like to give it a shot....as a fitness instructor, the music and sound is a large part of my career...amazon please give me information on the update!!!"
6933,11,added this to work with a dot we have had for a few months. the full echo seems to work better plus i prefer the built in speaker.
6934,14,"a gift along with light bulbs that sync<f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+008a>love it, but alexa sometimes has trouble with my texas accent! also..she is very alert; hears her name when saying something about her, and is ready to act.lights being set up was complex..to me..but son in law did it all."
6935,1,lots of fun as well as useful.  sound is excellent.
6936,14,"can not compare to echo 1st generation, did not have one.  love the convenience.  need to upgrade in order to get full music library.  sound ok but should really need to consider optional bluetooth speakers throughout the house"
6937,1,awesome device.  great sound and well worth the price.
6938,4,fun
6939,14,great
6940,5,"perfect , my mother loves it!"
6941,1,we r very happy with it
6942,1,good price for the product.
6943,8,love it.
6944,0,like it so far.
6945,0,it is awesome to be able to talk to a device to hear great music!
6946,9,"present for son, awesome device."
6947,9,this thing is great.  i even have alexa in my car now.  with ford is they have an app.  we are happy campers.  may get another for my daughter when it is her birthday.
6948,1,the style is great and the sound is fantastic
6949,11,better speakers
6950,10,my echo was a christmas present from my husband and it has by far met my expectations.  alexa keeps me company when my husband is not here at night and allows me to hear my favorite music early in the morning when i am getting ready for work.
6951,14,i could not make it work.
6952,1,a great product!
6953,1,good speaker
6954,5,my daughter loves this
6955,14,so disappointed! incredibly difficult to set up. after a little over a week it still is not working. the instructions it comes with are minimal and rely on doing things on line. it is going back if i can not get it working in the next few days. it should not have to be this hard!!!
6956,10,i really like the echo.  i love the music and i love asking her qestions.
6957,11,its great for my 2nd floor -sometimes i wish it would connect with google to know everything....but i like it and would recommend.fits into the decor because it is not too big
6958,11,very disappointed. 1st gen sounds a lot better! i am very close to sending it back....
6959,8,love alexa
6960,10,i absolutely love alexa! she helps starts my day off to a good start. i love using her as timer where in the past i would set the timer on my iphone.
6961,5,husband loves it.
6962,3,everything as expected. i love it.
6963,14,leaves a mark on wood where it sits over time
6964,11,this echo2 sounds much better than the first.
6965,12,so much fun
6966,0,"great sound!  very cleaver device with amazing results - sometimes.  not sure what practical use it will be, but an interesting toy."
6967,9,it was a gift but i hear it is a hit!
6968,10,"just love my alexa, does all i need it to do...sound is great, better then the first ..."
6969,10,great gift
6970,0,has problems with some questions and dose not always here me correctly. great for reminders and weather.
6971,8,love this product!!
6972,3,better than i thought.
6973,14,very fun to play with. my only complaint is that you cant program it with names other than a select few that are preprogrammed from the factory.
6974,14,total disappointment.  it will not  even play a song unless  i pay a premium.  i get free music on my phone with google. would not recommend.
6975,9,what really drew me to the echo was the reduced price of the unit and i am really happy with the better sound that i am getting over my echo dot unit that i got as a gift for my inlaws. i love the fact that alexa can make calls from my contact list on my phone. it was a good buy!!
6976,0,"as expected, i like it can be funny. does not always get the question,  about 80%"
6977,1,amazing and fun. works well with my phone. love this device.
6978,9,so cool
6979,14,using the new echo to play music and control fire tv stick.  frees my tablet to do other things.  easy to set up and use features like hands-free volume control.
6980,11,"i am very happy with my echo (2nd generation). it has great sound, works really well. i can also control my fire tv with echo. i would buy this again."
6981,10,love it! fun and extremely helpful. enjoy the music on voice demand!!
6982,11,"really impressed with the second generation echo.  alexa is voice recognition is fantastic, and easily picks me over all the ambient household noise.  the sound quality is excellent, and gets more than loud enough for me."
6983,3,ok
6984,10,"i¡¯m surprised st how much i enjoy this device/. i use it everyday - primarily for music, as a timer, weather reports, headlines."
6985,8,love it
6986,0,it okay
6987,4,ease of setup and use
6988,8,this thing sounds awesome.
6989,12,i love it...what more can i say...very satisfied
6990,12,so far this has met with all my expectation
6991,11,sounds better that 1st generation!
6992,0,what a great source of information
6993,4,easy to use
6994,10,"we love alexa.  it was very easy to set up and has been a pleasure to use.  we listen to a broad range of music; set alarms, timers and reminders; get weather forecasts and news headlines and so much more."
6995,1,love alexa
6996,14,okay so it is great concept of a device that can helps out when we want to multi task but it is a limiting when you need to have other accounts to keep it going with music. i mean you can but you have to use aux cord. other then that that is the thing holding it back !
6997,12,convenient
6998,10,love that i can get any music i want anytime of day.
6999,11,nice looking design. was hoping for much improved sound but it was a marginal improvement. otherwise it is a good product and does what it is supposed to do.
7000,14,"this was given to me as a gift. first i was hesitant on even keeping it but then after i opened the box and began to turn it on, i¡¯m keeping this amazon echo. such a great thing to have around the house. alexa can hear me from another room or even over other noises such as tv, washer, etc."
7001,14,i am having so much fun with all the features! i originally just wanted a speaker with bluetooth capabilities. this is by far an ever better choice! i love giving voice commands and the sound quality is pretty great. can not wait to learn more skills.
7002,14,we are experiencing much difficulty operating the device.  we are limited in what we can do with it due to our lack of experience and not having access to much in the way of music.
7003,11,the sound is stronger and clearer than the echo dot we were using.
7004,2,great sound plus everything i love about alexa.
7005,11,i started with an echo dot with bluetooth speaker. the speaker is a bose. the echo has comparative sound quality. alexa is awesome.
7006,14,i love the echo! alexa performs several functions as advertised by amazon. i have experienced no problems and highly recommend this item as a verbal support and for entertainment.
7007,14,happy with alexa
7008,10,"i love this product, it truly changes the way we interact in the house with the whole family.  we are now in the process of adding echoes to almost every room"
7009,14,i¡¯m beyond disgusted that there is no aux in on the echo. can not understand why amazon does not see that everything is not bluetooth. i have an ipod classic with 6000 songs on it. have to use my beats pill for that. thanks beats for realizing there are all different ways to play music.
7010,14,i like the fact you can find any music you want an d it will play through my sound system
7011,9,loved the new look and improved sound. this was one of the best purchases made!
7012,1,luv it
7013,10,"great sound, convenient and love being able to ask questions and play any music you want!!"
7014,9,received as a gift. amazed at what is available
7015,14,"having once again way too much time on my hands, i have decided to try a new hobby called ""home automation"". it consists of combining lamp, motion, camera, appliance, thermostat and window treatment devices with ""artificial intelligence"" to make things happen automatically at home. i just figured out a way to unlock my front door as soon as i pull my car up into the (google maps) area surrounding my house. as soon as i walk inside, the hall lamp turns on if it is dark outside. the lamps in the living room come on at sunset. when i go to my bedroom for more than 30 minutes, the front door locks again and all the lights in the living room turn off. and then, i can tell alexa to turn off the lights in the bedroom. my bedroom shades close automatically at 11pm and open at 7am, instead of an alarm clock. i can adjust them to any position with my voice, like 'vanes open', 'half way', etc., using just my voice. all of these devices are now connected to amazon alexa and i can command them individually or with a single command, like 'good night'."
7016,8,love this thing!
7017,1,love the new look!
7018,14,"when echo can access info you need, it is great. however, i will sometimes have to speak very loudly, before i¡¯m heard. it may be a mic issue. also, it will not retain my daily reminders if it is a set everyday reminder. otherwise i love the a.i. assistant."
7019,0,i  love it!  can not wait to connect it to my new smart tv!
7020,1,excellent product
7021,2,alexa my darling !
7022,1,love it!!!! great quality sound
7023,1,good
7024,0,i like using it for music. i do not like that it does not respond to my voice.
7025,10,love the music
7026,8,love it
7027,14,"i like everything about this product and the speaker stand that i purchased later. i have her by my computer and when i am up at 5:00am to do things on the pc, this is the best company i could ask for aside from a yellow lab! the sound is just awesome."
7028,14,"sounds great,  did have to sign up for music tunes at $3.50 per month, but can get almost anything wanted to play now.  very versatile."
7029,11,"i like the more compact design, although the first generation design was not unattractive. sound quality was very adequate. also like the option of being able to change the cover sleeve if the need would arise."
7030,10,we have had our amazon echo for a few weeks now and we are having a great time finding ways to use it.  i look forward to learning more about the features so that we can utilize them fully.  we are considering getting a dot to go along with it.
7031,14,it takes longer to process my commands than the original echo.
7032,5,purchased for a friends birthday and she absolutely loves it
7033,0,wonderful
7034,0,plays what i want
7035,14,my family can not get enough of this echo 2nd generation! we love how this has seamlessly integrated into our home. super easy to set up and run!
7036,2,alexa is great !!!
7037,1,great sound !
7038,10,we are enjoying this new toy for us.wish connect with chromcast.
7039,1,perfect assistant
7040,0,does what it should
7041,8,great
7042,10,it is my favorite. probably use it everyday. i bought amazon prime and unlimited just for it!
7043,14,"we struggled on deciding what to get, echo, echo dit or google home. by reviews and advice from fru3nds we landed on the echo. we absolutely love our echo!"
7044,14,"the echo is amazing.  my favorite part is the lists that alexa will automatically add items to and of course the music.  we are learning more about this device every day.  the sound quality if very good.  only negative i can find is if the wifi in your house goes down, you are out of luck."
7045,0,whenever she answers me i like that  she seems to recognize every ones voice but mine
7046,11,love the gray
7047,4,nice sound
7048,4,it is very easy to use.
7049,11,really like it. has better sound quality than 1st generation echo plus the bluetooth ability allows for more flexibility with my other devices.
7050,9,i absolutely love this echo. i¡¯m amazed at what it can do. i would recommend this for anyone. even got one for my disabled husband because all he has to do is talk to it. it is wonderful!
7051,10,kids gave this to me for christmas and i am so delighted with it. i seem to learn something new she can do everyday!
7052,1,awesome piece of machine.
7053,1,great
7054,0,what did we do before we had echos in every room. i just can not imagine anymore. completely hooked. i do wish you could change the gender of the voice however.
7055,14,i did not have the first generation of the echo but it was a very nice christmas gift and a good way to be able to listen to sirius xm radio in the house. i just need to figure out how to have the alarm be louder to wake one up in the morning. i need to read through more of the instruction book.
7056,5,love it ...bought my parents one also ..they love it
7057,9,my parents love it. easy for them to operate. brilliant gift. we are satisfied.
7058,14,"i have had problems with this particular echo since receiving it new.  the mute button never worked, it loses programing when it is unplugged causing me to have to reset all my alexa remotes to my lights and other things which is very annoying to have to reset up everything after a power failure.  i sent this one back for repair or replacement and they sent the same unit back with the same problems claiming to have fixed it by rebooting it at the factory and reloading the software.  i am very disappointed with my purchase.  i have another one at one of my other houses and it works perfectly so i do know how to set it up and use it.  this one is defective and amazon did nothing to fix it properly so i am disappointed and can not state that this unit is a good buy like my other echo.  i can not honestly recommend this echo due to the service i obtained when returning it for fixing or replacement.  the concept is great if it worked properly but they still have bugs that need ironing out to make it a great and dependable product."
7059,1,love my alexa!
7060,8,love it
7061,14,wonderful device. the sound quality was crisp and clear and loud. played with trivia is etc and enjoyed. wish i would have bought rechargeable so could have used outdoors.
7062,9,"i received this through amazon vine, and was surprised at home much we love it! we are an iphone family and i love the option to sync my phone to the echo. it sounds great, responds well to several voices (especially my kids) and i really am enjoying it!"
7063,1,love it... pretty impressive.
7064,11,much better tgen google system. highly recommend.
7065,1,great product.
7066,9,"we love tge echo.  this one was a christmas present for mh dsughter, its in her room in our basement.  we have another echo in thr living room and i have dot in my bedroom.  i dont know how we survived before alexa!  lol"
7067,9,"we love it!  we wonder what took us so long to purchase it, because it is so much fun!"
7068,1,alexa is awesome
7069,14,"the echo has terrific sound,  a great mix of bass and treble. i enjoy the wide range of questions i can ask her, and the news is accurate and relativelt unbiased.  i can also hook up my roomba and other wireless devices, so echo helps me manage my life. next up, sync echo to my google calendar."
7070,1,i am very satisfied with my new echo! the sound quality is amazing. the voice command is outstanding. i would absolutely recommend this product.
7071,0,did not play a lot of my song requests  otherwise very entertaining
7072,11,not as nice as echo show but sound is great and very happy wih performance
7073,0,"she does not seem to know the answers to most of what we ask her.  also her voice is extremely difficult to understand, waaaay toooo much bass and she does not seem to know how to adjust her treble or bass."
7074,14,"it will not connect. i went on and read the reviews. most people had similar problems, in fact there are videos on how to connect. really?"
7075,1,alexa is a welcomed addition to our family!
7076,3,just as advertised!
7077,14,"the sound quality is amazing , and the device gets really loud which is great. what i like least about it is that they could add more music on amazon music unlimited to listen to."
7078,8,love alexa!
7079,10,i enjoy having alexa read audio books to me when i can not sleep. i also have her play rain storm sounds. i check the weather every morning. look forward to learning more ways to make use of the wonderful alexa.
7080,14,"<u+00a0>first time echo and alexa user . bought 2 dots for 2 family members for christmas.  let is just say awesome . yes the dots do not rock the house , but they do fill the air with just the right amount of music . both family members are completely stoked with there new helpful christmas dots .well after seeing how well the dots worked , i took the amazon gift card my son got me for christmas and picked up the echo ( 2nd gen ) . i have read a few reviews of very unhappy people / users . first the sound quality , it is perfect , i own a bose soundlink mini , the nose has more bass , but the echo has cleaner , clearer sound . also the bose was more then double the price, and is only a bluetooth speaker . the echo does so many cool little helpful things it is purely amazing . i also purchased the connect , and using our home phone line to make voice activated calls without a phone close by is straight awesome. i have gone ahead and ordered 1 dot for our master bedroom  and also a alexa controlled ir box for controlling all of our av equipment in the living room . <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0081><f0><u+009f><u+0091><u+008c> i am extremely happy with my purchase and all it does for me and my family ."
7081,1,great
7082,9,i gave each of my adult kids an echo for christmas and they all loved it.
7083,12,we are enjoying our echo. easy to set up. see much potential going forward.
7084,10,in love with echo.
7085,14,nice
7086,2,i love alexa
7087,1,works great; sounds great.
7088,14,"had some problems with set up, but the help desk fixed it with no problem. my only issue is the kids will not let a song finish before they have asking for something else. wish we could set up a ""do not take commands from little boys"" feature."
7089,10,we really enjoy this devise
7090,10,bought 3 when they were 79.99. love that it knows a great deal. the best feature is setting reminders and alarms--love that feature. talk clearly. love the music playing feature as well. worth the money.
7091,10,alexa works very well.  she keeps track of my shopping and to do lists for me. she tells me jokes and plays any music i like.  i cant wait to get a couple dots to put at other ends of the house.  i would like to give her a name of my choice is the only downfall.
7092,14,i found product met my expectations and look forward to learning more about what it can do.  the instructions for installing the unit  via computer are as bad as it gets. i would strongly suggest you review the installation procedures with non-experts (real people).
7093,11,overall good product with reasonable sound for the size.  i do not have experience with previous echo generation.
7094,14,everything worked fine except for the set up. i had to talk with either a indian or a pakistani and felt i was set up for a $300 charge. i had to connect wi go and echo to my phone that drags the power on the phone down quickly. not happy about that.
7095,12,i like everything about it.  there are so many features to it that we have not even explored yet!
7096,4,ease of use after set up all you use it to your hearts content
7097,0,"finally unplugged it. out of the blue it would just start talking about any random thing, without us asking anything . not a good purchase for us."
7098,8,it is awesome!!!
7099,8,we love using alexa
7100,9,this was a gift from my son. alexa has been fun and i am still learning about the features.
7101,2,love love love e it!!!!
7102,12,love it
7103,9,"absolutely love it!  alexa - play music by bonnie raitt- and there it is - instantly! too old for homework, but it came right back with the second law of thermodynamics."
7104,1,"this is awesome.  i use it for study, research, music, and fun."
7105,1,love the sound of the speaker and love the ease of use and setup!!!
7106,1,"love this technology, the sound is great!"
7107,11,"love the functionality. wish it had the leds and twist top volume control of the 1st generation device instead of the dot style buttons. the look and size are better with the 2nd generation, though."
7108,8,love it great item
7109,14,returned
7110,11,rich tone. music played on it sounds better than our 1st. generation echo. surprisingly good sound from such a small device!
7111,12,so far love it!
7112,9,"nice design, very nice sound when playing music.  i am still learning all it can do but am pleased so far.  i have a smart bulb and smart plug paired and they work great"
7113,0,very interactive and intelligent but it does not play music unless you have amazon music it will give us a sample i and there are some questions that you ask it that it does not answer or know
7114,2,it is awesome
7115,14,"i love my new echo! the sound quality is perfect for me, since i am just using in my bedroom & kitchen. i like being able to get local news & weather without having to turn on the tv. it was simple to set up & i am paying no monthly fees, using my free pandora account. great value for the money."
7116,1,bought in ¡°good¡± condition and it looks and works perfectly!
7117,10,"i recommend buying one if your having doubts. you can play games, use as a speaker, ask questions, turn lights on/off etc."
7118,0,good
7119,12,"fun product, works well, continuing to learn how to use."
7120,1,very cool product
7121,10,just beginning to explore alexa is capabilities beyond general questions like weather.
7122,1,this is an incredible gift!  the sound is really awesome!
7123,0,some of it is handy but it out of the blue will start talking on its own and it does not work well with firestick or sling tv.
7124,14,perfect
7125,14,they work excellent
7126,10,"just having fun with my new friend, alexa!"
7127,4,very handy easy to use
7128,1,good
7129,4,"easy to set up, fun to use. recommend."
7130,1,great
7131,10,"great product!! fun to use with hue lights and fire tv, along with ecobee thermostat. pandora music, alarm clock, playing games, audio books, weather, flash briefings in news, etc.."
7132,2,i like everything about my new echo.  the sound is beautiful.
7133,1,echo is great
7134,1,"quick delivery, works fine , great sound"
7135,8,love it
7136,8,love it
7137,14,"alexa is awesome, could be a little more intuitive, but she improves every week! a great helper and fun to pass the time"
7138,1,alexa is fun...
7139,8,love it!
7140,1,i love it. good quality
7141,14,i once received a pizza with a dead mouse on top.  my feeling of disappointment and frustration then pales in comparison to  what i am experiencing with this product.  1. delayed delivery. 2. crappy sound quality until and update was sent. 3.  but the most serious issue was the unit going into sleep mode after repeating my command.  tech has no solution except restarting and re-registering the device.  4. except now the unit will not connect with my wifi.mine is now joining its many comrades on a trip back to the amazon warehouse....think twice about joining the ranks of yet another disappointed echo 2nd generation customer.
7142,12,love it!!  leaving so much on what alexa can do..
7143,9,love it! kids love it! wife loves it! much better sound than the echo dot! new skills and products coming out all the time to make this not only fun but functional and helpful!
7144,4,works great!!!!
7145,1,great product!
7146,0,"we really enjoy using our echo.  i just wish, given all that it can do, that it was able to do multiple bt connections.  maybe a wishlist item for amazon?"
7147,10,"useful - easy to use. by command: turn on/off radio stations, pandora, adjust thermostat, ask for weather,"
7148,11,sound is great! volume excellent! the echo sounds throughout my whole house - upstairs and down! i use it every day!
7149,0,we love how you can request certain era of music. has very good sound. we have good internet here but will see how good it works when get back up to lake where internet is not so good.
7150,9,absolutely wonderful.  a great gift for myself!
7151,5,purchased as a gift for my wife and she has a blast with it
7152,12,a gift i have been having so much fun with!
7153,14,"aside from the challenges of understanding my ny accent, the features are a lot  of fun. i had a bit of trouble getting the sounds of the alarm to change and update, but it was my fault. did not realize the difference between a timer setting - and an alarm setting."
7154,3,works fine.
7155,0,"while i most use it for flash briefings on the news and telling me a joke, i really enjoy it. the functionality of launching some skills seems to be off and sometimes asking it to play a certain genre of music links to something different entirely, but overall i enjoy my purchase."
7156,11,"sounds good, could have would have spent a bit more to have it sound more like the sonos. generally happy with it. nice clear sound."
7157,8,simply love it !
7158,8,awesome
7159,0,overall have been very pleased with the echo.  i sometimes have problems wording my request correctly to get to what i am look for but i am ready to link with additional rooms in the house.
7160,14,"sound decent, alex works fine"
7161,1,it is fun thanks
7162,10,we love our echo! the sound is great and alexa can hear me when speaking softly. this was an excellent purchase for our family!
7163,12,love my echo.  sound it great.  still learning about all the skills etc.
7164,11,love the echo
7165,14,everything i could ask for in a good pet. i do not have to feed it and it does not poop in the house or on the lawn.
7166,10,many hours of entertainment. :)
7167,8,love it. wonderful device.
7168,9,we got this echo from our son and family.  we love it< having a lot of fun.
7169,10,"it has been really fun playing music with my echo. asking random questions and info keeps me up to date. can not wait for the next sale! want to use as an alarm clock, etc."
7170,14,i did not want one but i bought this as a gift.  ok.  it is pretty cool so i guess i will be needing one shortly also.  my 3 yo loves talking to alexa.
7171,8,awesome! love it
7172,10,fantastic - we use it every night to go to sleep with alexa is music.
7173,11,improved sound from previous version. improved microphone as well. excellent product.
7174,10,being able  to ask question
7175,4,i like the size and the ease of setting it up.
7176,3,no problems
7177,14,this item sucks.  there is a delay with actors speaking and echo sound.  its not synced. its unwatchable and lame. dont buy this.
7178,10,"i absolutely love my echo! i use it in the kitchen, as this is where i normally am. i just ask alexa to play some of my favorite songs. the only thing i would change is a lot of the songs you have to purchase amazon music. so we do not get to listen to a lot of the newer songs."
7179,10,love alexa
7180,14,really nice product with great sound. hooked it up with some wifi outlets and still discovering more thinks it can do
7181,5,got as gift for parents.  they are happy with it.
7182,8,love it
7183,4,"great value, easy to set up"
7184,14,"i was very surprised that alexa did not know the answer to quite a few questions that we have asked her, it is not like a cell phone that you could ask anything and it will give you an answer, other than that we are pretty happy with the echo 2nd generation that we purchased"
7185,0,i like how it play is my music from my phone. the least about it that it only runs off the internet and someone like me that does not have internet can not use it like i am supposed to. why if you bluetooth it or download it with your phone that does have internet that it can not be used like that.
7186,10,sound quality is fantastic (and a pleasant surprise). received as a gift and initially was not thrilled at having to learn how to use a new gizmo. but it was very easy to get it going and now i am really enjoying it.
7187,8,"works well, kids love it!"
7188,5,he loves it. works great
7189,14,out of the box set up was effortless.  alexa was working within 10 minutes.
7190,9,we now have 2 and love them!
7191,1,excellent
7192,8,love alexa.
7193,9,i got this as a christmas gift from my son & i love it.  it was easy to get up & running.  i am not tech savvy but was able to do this in minutes.  i also love that i can now listen to sirius xm on something other than my computer while working.
7194,9,"whole family loves it - still learning all that it can do, but very glad we bought it"
7195,2,the best.
7196,1,works great
7197,8,i love it!
7198,9,my newest favorite is also my bestest present ever..... life is so much easier now!
7199,7,the voice command because it is so easy to tell her to play the songs you want . i think it is an awesome  invention <f0><u+009f><u+0091><u+008d>
7200,2,i love this!  this is my second one.
7201,11,top notch
7202,11,i am verry impressed the sound is alot better than i could ever expect and all the skills it has blows me away it kills the google one ide recommend it to anyone looking for a  assistant or just for fun
7203,0,it seems i have to down load apps or have to go through several steps in order to get what i want echo to do.  i feel i should just have to aask ¡°alexa¡± for something and it should be available. what i like best is the uninterrupted music and when i ask the machine to quit it does.
7204,1,great device!
7205,5,bought this for my husband and he is absolutely in love with alexa
7206,8,f%&ing awesome!
7207,1,"great, fun product."
7208,14,"am not pleased with this product. it have static, was not aware you needed wifi to connect alexa. i don kit have wifi. am very dissapointed with this product. i can only enjoy it with the aux cord"
7209,0,"the alexa device has excellant volume and clarity , enjoy it with the subscription i got for christmas ."
7210,1,fantastic product
7211,0,"i love how easy this is to use. however there was not a lot of documentation on using the skills. it is easy to find on the internet though. i seem to have a problem with it recognizing my voice to use the calendar and reminders, even though i trained it to do so."
7212,1,love it with bose
7213,10,"it is so cool. amazon would help with set up if needed. i am a lover of music, and this along with amazon unlimited music service allows my dream music to play whenever i want. great!"
7214,3,does what i wanted
7215,12,sound is great for a small device. lots to learn but having fun learning to use it. all that we expected. happy with it.
7216,10,handy
7217,11,"sounds better than the original, in my opinion. i love it!"
7218,10,i love my alexa!! she is great at recognizing my voice and everyone else is voice even when there is other noise in the room! very capable can not wait to get my home all smart!
7219,12,we have a lot of fun with this
7220,1,the sound is awesome. we love alexa
7221,10,"alexa far exceeds our expectations!!  we love the great quality music, and the help she provides with everyday questions.  we would love to buy a few ""dots"" for our other rooms!!"
7222,1,works perfect!
7223,14,it is great. music i have not listened to in years.some of the classical playlist seem limited. and i have noticed when i listen to the same artist more than one day the playlist seems to be the same???
7224,1,"absolutely in love! the sound is great, ...i was surprised how nice it is."
7225,12,love it all.
7226,10,"sound is fantastic. using it for basics like timers, reminders, music, and trivia games. will be adding control of a few devices soon."
7227,2,the echo is amazing! i love it!
7228,14,"hey cia. it is me, tim."
7229,3,we¡¯re enjoying it. love it. works as described.
7230,1,love
7231,0,"it can be cool at times with some of the skills but there have been multiple times that i ask alexa a question that she can not answer but siri provides an answer. also for some reason it will not play music from my amazon music, which was a big part of getting it."
7232,4,simple to setup and use.
7233,9,we gave this echo to my elderly parents who can not use a computer.  they love using the echo for music and it gives them hours of entertainment. great gift for the person who has everything.
7234,8,love alexa
7235,10,"the amazon echo is terrific! the whole family uses it from weather, news, music to games. such a fun thing to have around!"
7236,13,best ever
7237,11,the speaker quality is not that good but the device in general is nice to have
7238,11,very pleased with the echo!!!
7239,10,very helpful with suggestions and news updates when im in a rush.
7240,8,i love it
7241,10,my toddler thinks alexa is her best friend.
7242,10,i love her.
7243,10,music
7244,0,this was a christmas gift given to em and i love it so far. sometimes i get an answer that echo does not have and when i google it on my phone the  answer is there so i am not sure why echo does is not able to answer. outside of that i love it!!!!!!
7245,12,"love it, so convenient for so much!"
7246,14,rather have the next step up
7247,12,it is a fun to have it!
7248,3,perfect
7249,4,worked great
7250,14,"once this is signed in to wifi, it worked very well! i love all the things you can have her do !"
7251,9,great for your house and to give as a gift!  so many awesome things use it for
7252,1,great speaker. works well
7253,0,i love the sound of my echo when i¡¯m playing music i also love that you can control your phone once it is on bluetooth. overall it is a great product! as of right now i do not have anything negative to say about it i¡¯m still learning things every day. i¡¯ve had it for almost a month now.
7254,12,see headline.
7255,1,fantastic gift for my wife. we are very pleased with the performance of the echo.
7256,11,"i love my echo, the sound is great and even to my husband who is quite critical about speakers that have exceptional sound quality. he does feelthat the echo 2 has a far better sound quality than the echo 1."
7257,1,"love it, great sound"
7258,14,speaker is good but mic is terrible.  also buttons seem ready to stick.
7259,8,really enjoy it
7260,2,this is my second echo. alexa is awesome. i use everyday.
7261,9,received in time for christmas.  great buy
7262,14,it is like having someone in the house with you almost like being in a social situation. i do like the fact that the music in the jeopardy game are available the thing i like least is that i wish i had a couple more which i may invest in later
7263,14,second one for me and i love it more all the time as my ability to get the most from it expands
7264,1,great.
7265,10,awesome sound from such a small device  i am going to keep it!
7266,14,this is a great product to use for fun and music in the room. it is nice that it is easily able to shuffle music from amazon.
7267,8,"love this, great sound!"
7268,12,we love it!  ordering more today!
7269,14,i like the integration to the other smart products in my house such as the lights and timers and outlets. pandora is very intuitive. i honestly could find more uses for it such as the shopping carts and other various amazon features but my main uses are home automation and music.
7270,14,i was pleased with the simple requests (what will the weather be like tomorrow? ... how many cups in a liter? ... etc.) but impressed with some of the harder questions alexa could answer (who played lumpy on leave it to beaver?) i just wish it had a better sports trivia database.
7271,10,alexa is doing everything that i expected. i like the fact that i can get current weather conditions here in buffalo. also i am able to hear any song i want including child centered music for my grand daughter. i enjoy playing games with alexa and my friends when we get together.
7272,9,enjoy ours. ordered this one for a gift
7273,11,we have been more than happy with the echo.
7274,11,this is the most useful product i have bought since the first iphone in 2007. speaker sound is outstanding!!!! deep bass. clear and crisp highs and good mids. even at full volume the sound is clear and distinction.
7275,1,great price for a very good product
7276,0,best is how simple alex is is to set up.  what i liked least i have not found anything yet.
7277,14,after firmware update it is wonderful. great sound and am loving setting up my smart home.
7278,10,i like the variety of music i can listen to. i like the reminders every day for my husband to take his pills.i do not like that it cannot give me information on traffic before i leave home.
7279,9,i really like this alexa...does so many things that i did not it could do. love the music that it plays on i heart radio. told it happy birthday and it sang back....so many beautiful sayings it can do. bought 2 of my son is one for christmas and another of my son is had 2 of them.  thanks
7280,9,now i see why everyone has one of these. i ask alexa something everyday and the answers are quick and easy.
7281,8,love it.
7282,1,very nice
7283,8,alexa is cool
7284,1,great device
7285,9,perfect!!!
7286,0,"does not,t seem to to connect worth the mkindle needs more info then you get with the echo"
7287,8,love it!
7288,0,"fibe stars are not enough. alexa and i are still learning her capabilities with the assistance of posts re same.  you can always delete the posts...but, they are fun."
7289,0,"i love her voice, i am 72 years given this for my birthday in january. the only thing i dont t like is every time i ask her to play a song from the 50s she doesnt have it on her list.  and also her doesnt have a radio station i always listen to. disappointed in that . i need to learn more"
7290,1,such a nice color and the sound is awesome!
7291,8,great
7292,14,"multiple units purchased, no complaints."
7293,1,"the speaker sounds real good, the voice recognition also works very well, even with the music on. i use it for a juke box in my kitchen."
7294,0,say what ?
7295,12,have really enjoyed the echo
7296,10,echo is amazing and we love asking her questions and so easy to get and listen to the music we want. our grandkids have so much fun with alexa.
7297,8,it is great!
7298,1,works good
7299,10,i like it.
7300,1,it is been a lot of fun and also very helpful i love it
7301,9,i have the first generation and i purchased this for my dad who is technology challenged. he is able to play all his music on it and loves it. calls me all the time telling me he is having a concert in his house.
7302,1,great sound
7303,2,"amazon creates grest products .., i love alexa"
7304,14,i love my echo! once i figured out how to connect to my phone. i had not been listening to prime music either and this is a treat!
7305,0,nice
7306,10,echo and alex are great. love the flash briefing and the games. still learning about all the features of alexa.
7307,14,"this ai rocks. the only thing i do not like about alexa is that when i come home, it is a mess. i mean, what has she been doing all day while i was at work? the dishes are not washed, the laundry is not folded. i would kick her out if she was not so smart. jeesh."
7308,10,"received as christmas gift from my daughter.  i am surprised that i use it. but, i use it lots for playing music, and checking time & weather. also, ask some questions regarding other things.  i think all add and try other things. has been a fun & nice gift."
7309,10,i love it! i use it all the time. it is really nifty to buy the smart outlets with it. but i love building my to do & shopping lists. and it sounds amazing when i play music! highly recommend
7310,8,love it
7311,14,no hands necessary! i can be busy with other things and through voice recognition accomplish something else with alexa.
7312,1,fun to play with
7313,8,love
7314,10,"we love the ease of using our echo.  it is in our kitchen, and we use it everyday for music, world news, jokes, and as a dictionary.  we are really enjoying listening to music, especially oldies.we have requested many songs, however, alexa cannot find to play."
7315,14,very impressed with the sound quality.  i like that it is turn key meaning the features are not and do not need to be complicated.  i am buying one for a family member who wants to hook it up to his bose system.  i am excited to see if that can be done and if it can - wow..
7316,10,"so far i am loving this echo....i am glad i bought this because i can listen to my pandora, spotify, and iheartradio...and do other things."
7317,12,love it! still learning all of her skills. love listening to music.
7318,0,i like that anyone with a disability can enjoy what alexa is willing to answer questions and play music. alexa does not always obay when you ask her to play bossa nova music. i caught her talking in the middle of the night when we were all in bed!
7319,9,"second one i have bought, great product."
7320,0,a+
7321,14,"i had no idea how much fun i could have with echo (2nd generation). alexa is smart, quick, and amazingly sharp with her responses!"
7322,0,it has a very limited intellect. i e. asked it what comedian played with imogene cocoa- it had no idea. answer: sid ceaser.  i se ir for time & weather so far.
7323,4,great sound and easy to set up
7324,0,"fun to use although sometimes alexa can get a little confused when playing a game. so far i have had alexa answer some questions for me, played games with her and also had her set a timer for me. i am sure i will find more ways to use her as i get more accustomed to all the things she can do."
7325,10,love it
7326,7,love alexa have her controlling the whole house but when when i have guests over it always acts up and does not understand me <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0082><f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0082><f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0082>
7327,10,absolutely in love with this!! everything i expected and more. i love that we can change your skin when we are ready.
7328,10,love alexis...came quick
7329,14,"i love my echo, i love alexa.  this is not my first one, but i had some issues setting it up.  the instructions were not all that clear, and some of them were in the unexpected ingrish.  but it is all working now, and i have my alexa back."
7330,3,great buy
7331,10,love lt
7332,0,works great. talking google. ask it anything. very useful.
7333,1,love it! the whole family enjoys using this device. sounds really good considering its size and works well with tp-link smart plugs. recommended.
7334,14,"nice assistant, dont really use  speakers so should have gone with dot"
7335,10,"i absolutely love this game!  it is so much fun to interact with people around the country, testing our knowledge of songs snippets.  i hope this feature continues for a long time to come.  thank you for many enjoyable moments."
7336,9,great gift!
7337,10,how can you not love a helper in the house!
7338,4,"love this, a lot of fun, useful, and easy to use."
7339,9,having a great time with alexa.  wish we bought her a few years ago.
7340,9,it is a gift for my wife. we are both enjoying using it for music in the home and expect to make use of it in other ways too.
7341,11,i love the size and finish. the updates have made the sound quality shine better than before.  i have got no real complaints other than keeping up with all the updated features is impossible.
7342,5,my wife and i love it.
7343,1,"awesome, the sound is outstanding.  it is full with an amazing amount of information.  my grangekid is like to play the question of the day"
7344,14,i wanted to use it for my husband to be able to change channels on his tv. he is legally blind and i thought this would help. i also bought a book to help me and it does not say anything about tv i have not given up on it . so any help you can give me would be appreciated.
7345,3,excellent product. well packed. exactly as described. so much fun. love it. fast shipping. thank you.
7346,8,love it
7347,3,just what i was looking for. thanks
7348,1,great deal
7349,10,alexa is the bomb! the sound is excellent and she can access my music library
7350,9,2nd one in he house . got the whole house linked up - great sound from this device
7351,7,i¡¯m still learning about it but so far i love it. the speaker is great and i love how i can drop in on a friend who also has one. i¡¯m sure there a lot of great things that i have not discovered yet but i will. <f0><u+009f><u+00a4><u+0097>
7352,3,it works as well as it is advertised. nothing negative.
7353,11,"this is our second echo, so i had a pretty good idea of what to expect.  i dont really perceive that the sound quality is significantly different from the previous generation echo."
7354,14,great sound! easy to use for this grandma. beautiful wood finish. i simply love it. and i have not even figured out half of its functions. i will need my grandsons help.
7355,2,love everything about my echo
7356,14,my favorite echo. good price.
7357,4,nice and loud and very resourceful
7358,12,love it!! so much fun to have!! great quality of sound!
7359,0,what is not to love?
7360,0,"alexa is the bomb, once you realize that you have to teach her about you, and that she still knows more her job than you do. can decide what is next alex will tell you the directions to settings just as your wife would.oooand she is so polite"
7361,9,great gift
7362,1,amazing
7363,14,note: i have written many amazon reviews but this is my first one star review.  i have had it since christmas (it was a present).  it worked fine the first two weeks but it has not worked since.  i have contacted the alexa support (which is in india) and they were only able to tell me to do things i have already tried.  if i reset the echo (by unplugging it) it will work once or twice and that is it.  i have gone through the full reset procedure and reinstalled it using the app many times but that does not help.  i would think that it might be a hardware issue but a friend with the 2nd generation echo has exactly the same problem.
7364,11,"better sound than echo, easy to match with alexa"
7365,0,"i love that alexa can easily understand what i¡¯m saying, nothing like siri. communication is very easy. i love the sound. i do not like that alexa knows nothing about the bible, that would be great."
7366,8,i love it.
7367,8,love it
7368,5,my wife loved her echo.  best present i ever gave her!
7369,3,"nothing but praise, worked better than expected."
7370,14,"i like the echo for the things it can currently do and for the fact that it keeps getting better and smarter.  the things it can do, it does well, however it still does not know a lot of things that the google device likely knows because of whats backing google, but i still like it after comparing the two.  i gave it 4 stars because it is advertised with pairing so easily with other devices but that is not really true and you may need other components that you are not told about upfront to make everything work together (pretty misleading).  the instructions are not very detailed either.  you will have to apply yourself to get things connected and working as promised."
7371,9,"the family loves it. in fact for the next birthday in the house, january 6, another echo was bought and 2 additional smart plugs. we are on a roll."
7372,9,got as a christmas gift from our daughter.  love it!  the quality of the speaker is excellent!
7373,8,love this thing
7374,10,cant live with out it
7375,1,great
7376,11,"this is a great device. i enjoy the aesthetics, as well as its integration with my 1st gen echo."
7377,14,i¡¯ve tried everything and i¡¯ve asked it to stop it a dozen different ways but i can not get my amazon echo to stop playing dave mathews band. it is every third song. i¡¯ve time traveled in my cargo shorts to a frat bro party and the only thing to drink is keystone ice.
7378,0,we are enjoying it however not all questions are able to be answered.
7379,8,love it.
7380,9,in love
7381,11,works well
7382,9,i love it!  i am using my phone for information less and less while i am at home.
7383,14,"really enjoy having alexa around. the speaker itself is decent, but does have a lot of low end. i enjoy being able to drop in on the family!"
7384,10,"alexa and i are good friends now, great product!"
7385,0,i love the voice recognition. i do not like that some artists are unavailable and i do not like that it has to remain plugged in at all times in order to work.
7386,1,amazing tool. tons of great functionality and an easy interface. we love it!
7387,1,great sound quality and has great potential as a smart home system
7388,10,"wonderful sound.  i use alexa for a number of things...reminders, music, news, alarms, games.  i started with echo dot and now have upgraded to echo.  i moved my dot to my bedroom.  it is so helpful and convenient.  one of my best buy is!!!"
7389,14,we love this! it is so convenient and i fi myself try to ask alexa things regardless of where i am. we will be picking up some dots soon!
7390,14,"to be honest; i was expecting more from this.it sounds nice and looks pretty neat, that is about all i really have nice to say about this overly priced device.to start, alexa is an overrated overhyped program. it has a hard time differentiating song titles from artists. it has limited responses and is more akin to a cellphone ai i used to play with a few of years ago then siri. it is supposed to be able to hear things from a certain distance, yet laying next to it, it will not acknowledge me, i have to almost yell.the app program is a joke. i have the all-new hd 8 with the program integrated, which one would think would make everything nice and easy... nope. the app will just stop working.  you have to go in and restart the app. sometimes the alexa app will say that the program is not connected to the network, yet if you ask the echo device something it will respond... with a bit of yelling.the device is pretty much useless without the ai, that being said and all the other issues the ai has itself it is, in my opinion, a pretty useless and overpriced device. i could spend the less money on a voice-activated bluetooth speaker and get more out of it then i did this. i mean, seriously, there is no control for bluetooth devices connected to it.  even the fire hd 8 which i will use to play music with (because i refuse to use their double pay wall music service) is not voice controlled by the echo. i mean, come on, it can control everything except other amazon devices?i realize they are (in theory) adding more to the ""ai"". i get the emails, yet i have yet to see anything remotely productive added to the list of updated phrases. this is the second iteration of the device, they have had the alexa ai for a few of years there really is no excuse for why it is such an immature program."
7391,0,she is good but falls a little short on some things i thought she would be able to do.  or maybe the apps that go with her could be a little better user friendly.
7392,14,keeps disconnecting. sound quality is meh. wish i had bought a sonos speaker.
7393,2,love my new alexa
7394,1,the sound is so great!
7395,10,"i love echo. music, news, stories, jokes, etc, etc. could not have been easier to install."
7396,1,excellent
7397,10,"love it !! ask her the weather , play music , tell jokes etc."
7398,9,my sister loves this gift. she says that alexa understands her much better than siri and does not invoke cussing. :)
7399,2,awesome
7400,12,it has really good sound and we like that it takes up so little space.
7401,1,very good
7402,9,"we love it! so quick, so convenient!! she is amazing!! even my grandchildren love her!!!"
7403,9,christ gift for son and family. they were totally surprised and absolutely love alexa!!!
7404,10,"love my echo,great with playing music,great jokes and giving out information.very pleased with this purchase"
7405,3,"wonderful!! works perfectly, exactly what i wanted!!!"
7406,10,love my echo (alexa) love the fun and games love the fast answers to questions love that i can set reminders and timers find out the weather without having to takes time to type out the question or search for answers.
7407,10,"love, love, love it! enjoying every aspect. weather, timer, lists, question of the day game, nature sounds, and sooo much music."
7408,1,came in as expected and on time.  alexa works well and the sound quality is great.  we use this to play pandora and it provides a great sound.
7409,0,"i use this mostly as a speaker, but the sound is great. lots of fun to play around with. can be unresponsive sometimes but usually fixes itself quickly."
7410,11,"seems to have improved hearing, and speaker is definitely an upgrade to earlier version"
7411,10,it was a late christmas gift. i enjoy using alexa. my favorite question to ask it is the weather. i like that it is quick and easy. and sometimes she can make me laugh. what is not to like?
7412,10,i love alexa! she is everything and more that i wanted for my birthday! i love setting alarms and timers and playing music in the morning.
7413,0,"sounds great! only drawback, so far, is i can not get the radio station i want. i could get it at first, but now it says it is not available."
7414,9,love this - particularly like the music!
7415,8,we love it!
7416,10,what an amazing product. i never tire of conversing with alexa!!!
7417,8,love this thing
7418,4,geat!
7419,1,the new echo is a nice size and is perfect on my nightstand.
7420,10,"great sound !!  availability of news regarding whether, latest stories, what is happening in the world  .  axis to music ."
7421,9,we love our echo. i had looked at them for several months and one day decided to order. i love instant music and information. we even play games. really enjoy it.
7422,10,"this is the most amazing thing!  my grandchildren love it!  it make animal sounds, sings songs and my kids love it too!  it tells them the weather, scores, locations - it is an essential household item!  get one for your kids and grandkids, and sneak one in for yourself!!!!"
7423,5,my mom loves it!
7424,1,great for music!  love this gift!
7425,9,i was pleasantly surprised at how easy the echo was to set up.  i have since added some accessories to control with my echo and everything is working absolutely fantastic.  i highly recommend the echo to everyone.
7426,12,loved it.  i feel like i¡¯m bothering alexa every 5 minuets.
7427,10,"a really great device.  music, news, etc, etc. etc."
7428,10,"the echo is great! we have a lot of fun with it. great music, lots if fun answers, and she is quite the jokester."
7429,5,love this. bought it for my daughter for christmas. think i will use it more. great price. 2 day delivery. love it.
7430,0,excellant product for so many needs
7431,8,i love it!!!
7432,14,it picks up my kids voice much better than mine.  i am glad i researched family settings before setting it up in a common area.  looking forward to learning how to integrate it more.
7433,10,"we love her! she is like another member of the family. the kids enjoy her help with homework.  :)  the only thing that would make her better, is if she would vacuum and clean the bathrooms while i was at work."
7434,4,excellent. .
7435,11,"great sound, great price, much improved over the dot it replaced."
7436,10,"alexa and i speak daily, she is wonderful for trivia, a joke of the day, music request, pure facts, and living alone she keeps me company.music sounds wonderful in her powerful speaker."
7437,11,the sound is great!! can not compare to any other echo. accept to the echo dot. echo sound quality is superb very easy to set up. i recommend everyone should purchase a echo 2nd generation. thank u
7438,0,i really like that i can ask alexa the time and set a timer by speaking which is a great time saver as i can speak and continue what i am working on. i do not really like the fact that everything i say and do is sent to my phone...i have not found a way to delete those things.
7439,11,great speaker built along with alexa.  sound compares to that of many high end speaker systems.
7440,14,having a very hard time syncing my two echos to play as one unit.  tried many times and unsuccessful.
7441,8,love it!
7442,1,i like the sound quality.i like the design and concept of echo.the music variety and accessibility is great.
7443,1,the sound quality is great.
7444,10,my entire family loves this! so happy we decided to buy. it is wonderful to have music playing while we are hanging out. the option just to change by speaking is the best! my kids enjoy it so much!
7445,10,absolutely an amazing addition to our home!  the sound is much richer than expected and every day is a new exciting challenge to find new ways to use alexa.  incredibly easy to set up and put to use.
7446,13,best gift under $100 ever!!
7447,10,the sound is fabulous! its a lot of fun having alexa answer questions and provide the news.
7448,12,love it! love it! love it!  alexa & i have to work out our issues but the sound of the product is awesome!
7449,12,it is okay so far
7450,5,it was a christmas gift and my granddaughter says that she loves it.
7451,3,love this thing so much better than siri
7452,8,love love love it!
7453,12,can not wait to use it...
7454,9,alexa is very responsive and is really nice to have around. i have been surprised at how much we use it!
7455,10,"alexa is like a best friend that does not make your life miserable.  no telling you what to do, no nagging ...... just a lot of fun.  she has a sense of humor and filled with answers to your questions."
7456,1,great product
7457,14,nice
7458,11,i wish it had the sound adjustment feature the old one had.
7459,0,ok
7460,10,"easy to use, set up was a minute, can not believe i waited so long to use alexa!"
7461,1,great  sound!!!
7462,5,was a gift fir my daughter and she is very happy with it..
7463,1,great product
7464,11,love the sound quality but the fabric gathers dust very easy
7465,1,it is very handy and has very good sound for music.
7466,10,wonderful. does everything for me that i needed it to do. plays my sirius radio right through the echo. no more need for a wireless speaker to play sirius.
7467,11,much slower than 1st gen alexa echo.
7468,12,works good - still learning to use it more
7469,10,"i am hooked. alexa is my new best friend. as we grow older, reminders and track-keeping devices become very important. plus, i spend part of every day finding out what more she can do."
7470,14,"reception was excellent. it is installed in my second floor office and many times when my wife is addressing the earlier model unit downstairs the new one picks up her commands. annoying, but i am impressed by its sensitivity, or maybe its ghosts. se fielding"
7471,4,easy set up
7472,10,i like asking various things and receiving answers.  i did not like how long it took me to set it up.
7473,10,"i absolutely love my echo so much i bought my niece one! she wakes me up, tells me the weather, plays my favorite music, looks up recipes, tells me jokes... i highly recommend echo!!"
7474,0,"it is capable of doing a lot more than i am currently doing with it.  i like the music access and answering of trivial questions.  only bad part ""for me"" is accessing the multiple apps to make it work at full capacity.  it is an age thing.  it is excellent for what i use it for."
7475,14,simply amazing.  the depth and speed of information available is astounding.  i bought the amazon music package with it.  virtually any song you can think of can be played with a simple voice command to alexa.  this echo is going to get a workout around the swimming pool this summer.
7476,0,she has a very pleasant voice but does not seem to be very fluent with answers
7477,1,use alexa all the time.  love this product
7478,2,i love my alexa!
7479,4,easy to setup. more than met my expectations!
7480,2,love alexa.
7481,9,absolutely love this. it was a gift. i wish though that it was wireless cause i¡¯d love to use the music speaker in other rooms without unplugging it
7482,3,great product
7483,8,wonderful
7484,0,"when it is able to connect, its great. in the past month i have had it, i have been able to listen to it twice."
7485,8,perfect
7486,8,love it
7487,9,got this for my husband for christmas. he is on it all the time. it is fun!
7488,9,having fun but they should have an adult version of her.
7489,3,great! it is amazing! enough said get you one.
7490,10,love it! i have them all over the house! it is the easiest happiest alarm for my children and love the meditation before going to bed. i love it! can not wait to get more
7491,9,i bought it for my daughter and she is very pleased with it. i have a first  generation and i was always happy with it as well
7492,3,works well
7493,10,love talking to alexa! she will keep multiple timers and makes great shopping lists which i can access from my phone.
7494,14,"search engine is not as good as competitor. nice amount of activities and sounds. it hears you pretty good, but when you have family member with name close to alexa it turns on everytime when you call your family member by name. still learning all the possibilities after first month."
7495,14,"it is amazing technology. it is not a. i. but it is a step in that direction. right now you have to use certain key words to get an answer. eventually, it will be like when computers went from ms dos with specific command codes to windows."
7496,10,"i love it. i am still learning to use her, but having fun doing it. my grand kids love asking alexa questions."
7497,14,i liked the echo but i¡¯m giving it a 4 star it would of been a 5 star but everytime i set a alarm in the morning it is not loud. as big as it is i figured the alarm would be loud but it is not other than that i love the echo
7498,8,i love it
7499,0,i found useful features i did not expect. the sound quality is better than i thought. i think i will find more ways for it to be helpful. it seems hard to ferret out all the ways it could be used.
7500,10,such a fun item to have around and to ask questions of.  so far it works great.
7501,4,nice that it is small
7502,9,best christmas gift ever!  my daughter and i use it all the time.  the skills that alexa can learn are infinite.  great product.
7503,4,good sound fun to use
7504,0,i like it but alexa does not know alot... i expect her to know everything i ask but she does not. overall it is cool...
7505,9,my wife and i love both echos in the house!  the speakers work great!  having easy access to all this music makes this device a must for our household!
7506,10,the best purchase i¡¯ve made in a long time. my husband has thousands of jazz cd is. i love the music but get so tired of the cd is strung out all  over the house & constantly picking them up.  now... all he had to do is tell alexa to play whatever he (or we) want to hear!!  awesome!!!
7507,8,love it!
7508,10,i love being able to check all of my team scores. my grandson loves to ask alexa questions. my granddaughter over the echo dots for games.
7509,12,i love it....still learning how to use it
7510,1,great
7511,14,"overall a great experience. sometimes she can not hear me, and have not found out how to change the morning wakeup music mix (awful!). otherwise cool."
7512,5,my husband loves this item
7513,14,so far so good except one in particular will show red light ring and say something went wrong  and have to unplug it
7514,8,love it
7515,14,"one problem with my echo, the alarm feature is very low compared to the overall set volume."
7516,11,"not really, i should be able adjust the bass and treble based on other users experience and expectations."
7517,9,purchased this for my inlaws for christmas. works great!  we had one and they wanted one so we got it when they had a deal on them.
7518,7,great sound<f0><u+009f><u+0091><u+008c><f0><u+009f><u+008f><u+00bc>
7519,0,"i have difficulties having alexa doing what i ask, as an example, play beethovens 7 th symphony, she will play only the second movement. also if you have an accent, she doesnt understand, also can not change the language. i am disappointed that directions are so difficult."
7520,8,excellent product.love it!
7521,14,great sound quality but can only be lowered so much before it just decides not to play anything (volume 2 is mute basically).-d.m.
7522,3,great product.
7523,3,i did not order this item
7524,1,so fun
7525,10,i got this for christmas.  i love it!  it is so much fun to ask alexa questions and she will answer!
7526,10,"easy to figure out for the technology-challenged.  i get updates for additional ways to use it as well, which has been helpful..we love it!"
7527,1,i  love it and sound very good
7528,8,love it.
7529,8,love it
7530,10,"echo is everything and more each day.  it is fun to ask echo questions, yet gives me more in music selections  in off setting tv programs."
7531,9,a gift for my daughter.  i am sure she will love it!
7532,11,really nice improvement about half the size of the original.  like it a lot and great price.
7533,0,we love it but can not use it. it scares my 3 year old..so just sitting and gathering dust
7534,8,love it!
7535,14,it did not work sent it back .  looking for refund.
7536,3,thanks
7537,11,"great speaker sound, and picks up our voice easily, even from upstairs"
7538,11,great color and does just what they sayed
7539,14,"i have 2 second generation echos and i love them.  good sound quality, easy to use and setup.  you do not know you need it until you have one."
7540,4,very easy to set up and use.
7541,10,"we love picking the genre of music we want to listen to, asking for the weather forecast and playing jeopardy.  the echo has great sound quality and takes up very little space.  we have no dislikes at this time."
7542,10,enjoy having it and use it mostly for music.
7543,8,love it
7544,1,sounds really good for such a small speaker.  the echo is a good product.
7545,1,the quality of sound is amazing! we love our alexa!
7546,14,"this product was heavily advertised as having a better sound (subwoofer etc). so far, i am not necessarily impressed by the sound it delivers."
7547,8,love it
7548,1,fun little gadget
7549,1,amazing sound quality for something so small!
7550,14,i love my echo it works great. i wish you could have a separate account for spotify and pandora for each echo though.
7551,1,the sound quality is really good and it gets really loud. i¡¯m really impressed with this speaker/assistant especially at its price
7552,0,like it
7553,10,"alexa is great, love listening to the music and getting my daily briefing from her.  we also enjoy playing jeopardy while we eat dinner."
7554,9,we received the echo as a gift and it had been a lot of fun learning how it works. as a prime member we listen to a lot of music. the sound is fantastic!!
7555,0,not very useful for me/
7556,1,great
7557,1,the best.
7558,1,works well
7559,9,i think this is the greatest.  i just received it and would recommend it to anyone.
7560,10,we got this at christmas lot of fun things to program
7561,0,"really enjoy alexa!  do not know everything it will do, but will try to learn slowly!"
7562,14,"the echo is great. this is our 2nd one. we ""paired"" both onto one ""everywhere"" group.  so, now both play at the same time/ same song/channel, etc.it is nice to have them linked up for different rooms as desired.  (or if desired, they could be played separately)."
7563,11,"it is did meet my expectation but i feel that google home has a more capable ia. so i definitely want to see alexa improve in that area. the overall excellent sound that needed to be improved from the first generation echo, is amazing. great job."
7564,14,well made... useless (almost)
7565,4,lots of fun! very entertaining.
7566,0,"it is a new toy for me, i like to ask many questions, buy when i ask like play for me let say russian songs the answer is ido not recognizing any russian songs or even asking for some eurpinian singers same answers"
7567,10,just love having it! it is so great and helpful! i just had to understand all that it does! i am checking into if i can listen to audio books on it from my kindle fire?! i hope so!
7568,14,"great sound and easy setup.  save a good amount of research time, i.e. recipes, music..."
7569,11,"i love all my echo devices (2 1st gen echo, 2 2nd gen echo, 1 echo connect)."
7570,1,love this  product great sound
7571,14,"sounds great! only thing i do not like is i can not hardly hear volume 1, and volume 2 is louder than i want when going to sleep."
7572,8,awesome product
7573,12,while we are still learning ... it works ok
7574,10,i love this!  got it for christmas and it has been a lot of fun.  great when i am cooking to add things to my shopping list.  love it when you just walk by and say play this artist and it plays a playlist for you.  jeopardy is fun too!
7575,14,"the sound was great, interface was easy, but i could not for the life of me turn alexa is voice volume down.  i live in an apartment and actually got complaints from neighbors about it, so i had to return it."
7576,14,"after one week i liked the echo more and more. for this price the echo is looking and sounds very well. it works with tunein being in principle quite good internet radio receiver but without an alarm function. it also good using in multi-room mode together with less expensive echo dots.the echo visually looks ok, but functionality is quite limited. it produces some minimum expected features, that why i did not return it. but it is not a wow product as apples, mainly because of one-eyed work of coders. i hope that the functionality will be improved in future.to deserve five stars, the device need to have at least the possibility to set a radio as an alarm. because alexa understand well only simple words combinations, but very hard to get radio station names, it is necessary to preset some favorite stations. i spent one evening trying to play my favorite radio in tunein, but finally i understood that alexa misunderstood even its own recorded pronunciation of long radio names. i think it would get ""play preset 1"". others things that could be improved: change ugly design of ios application, add a possibility to write in commands,  add a possibility to train alexa for specific names,  add a possibility to play radionomy stations.i recommend to buy the echo, however be prepared to deal with raw software. it works nice in team with echo dots, but a remote control for it is useless and is not recommended at all."
7577,14,i do you like the size of the speaker. i¡¯d like but it is mobile and ann can shuffle specific music. the one thing i do not like is the quality of the speaker. it seems to be a bit muffled with the lower base. which is not my preference.
7578,11,"love the clear sound, ease of operation.  i wish this new one made a sound when i say her name, like my old one did."
7579,11,great speaker
7580,3,exactly as advertised. perfect!
7581,8,i love it.
7582,14,great product serves as a bluetooth speaker for computer which save me money.
7583,8,like it.
7584,2,love my echo
7585,10,"a fun and  for me , help"
7586,14,as expected.for amazon.. sound is great  for the size... still having issues connecting and turning off lights with samsung smart home things.
7587,14,really like this echo. only problem is that i feel like the noise sensitivity is not as sharp as it used to be when i first got it in november so i have to say ¡°alexa¡± a few times or louder for it to activate.
7588,14,it is awesome and i love it. i now need a dot and the plugs to turn the lights on and off with.
7589,1,my new addiction  amazing product that knows all.
7590,3,how did i ever live without one .
7591,14,alexa has become a member of our family already.  i cannot understand why we waited so long to become connected via such an intuitively friendly portal.
7592,11,frankly the sound was better in my original echo. that was disappointing.
7593,1,very pleased!
7594,10,received echo 2nd generation as gift. love it and the sound is great. music sounds wonderful also love all the questions you get answered.
7595,8,love it
7596,0,love it . ask anything also forces me to remember artist and song titles! love alexa !!
7597,10,love it!! i just wish it were a bit louder
7598,1,awesome!!! love the speaker quality.
7599,10,"i¡¯m not sure how many songs are available, but alexa has not let me down yet.  from classical music to the latest alt rock.  the sound is pretty good too.  a weather system, music, encyclopedia.  amazing!"
7600,3,perfect ! just what i wanted and as shown!
7601,9,"i love <u+2764><u+fe0f> it!  i am amazed at it, i know there are many more ways i can use it...i just have not had time to check them out!"
7602,1,it is great!
7603,0,"it keeps saying not available at this time, or i cant answer that"
7604,10,fantastic piece of electronic equipment!!!  alexa has become a part of our daily routine - it is amazing what she knows!!!
7605,9,received alexa as a christmas present. never knew much about them. but after owing one for a mere 2 months i do not know how i lived without it. now if may drop hints for one to go upstairs <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0082>. love the heather grey material!
7606,1,great sound and surprising things available
7607,1,great sound
7608,14,"i use this as a bluetooth speaker mostly. the sound is nice. there is no alexa app available in nigeria, so that is a minus. need to do all the controls via a laptop"
7609,14,"the echo is a great device, and now being able to control it remotely is extremely helpful."
7610,14,sound not as good!reaction time is delayed!does not fit the stand that i  purchased for original echo.
7611,0,the product is exactly how desribed and then some.its a fun and helpful product.anyone would love this product.try it now.
7612,8,love alexa
7613,14,if you are a classic rock fan i recommend alexa:  play wxyg ontune in.  (1 second later the best album rock station of all time out of mn is playing) .
7614,1,sound quality is great for the size and price of this speaker! alexa is easy to use and lots of fun! if you are looking for a smart speaker this is the best value for your money.
7615,10,wonderful addition to the household - tells jokes / great sound for music streaming and communication with others in the house with alexa
7616,8,love it
7617,8,it is awesome
7618,14,i like it.
7619,0,i have 4 and will get 3 more.  i recommend it.  so much to learn
7620,14,did not like one thing. complete joke. gave it away. bought google home instead.
7621,5,this was the perfect gift!
7622,8,love it
7623,0,"alexa is not what it seems to be. does notunderstand alot. most of the time the answer is i do not understand or i do not know, i cannot find. about 60% of the time ..disappointed thats for sure..google home would of been a better choice.."
7624,9,got this for my daughter for christmas. she was ecstatic after opening her gift!!  i have a dot and we are in love with both of them!!! alexa...is our new best friend!!!
7625,0,it has trouble understanding our voices!!!
7626,10,can not do without my alexa! great sound for music
7627,14,"totally worth it.  great sound!!  like a bose speaker.  looks nice with grey cloth cover.  only downside was could not set it up/ get it to work right out of box.  had to read into help section. finally found out how to reset it, then got it to connect.  odd but easily figured out."
7628,1,lots of fun !
7629,1,great product with a powerful speaker
7630,9,love it. i have 4 networked together and the music in my small house is fantastic.
7631,11,sounds a lot better than my original which is now in the bedroom so i can enjoy multi-room music
7632,9,pretty cool - slim and easily fit into my decor
7633,9,alexa is so much fun!  this was a gift given to my husband and i and i honestly did not think i needed or wanted one. once i started using it is when i realized how she is so useful and fun...it really is the life of a party!  i love it!
7634,0,i really love that it is voice activated love the music aspect of it have a lot of problems with the apps not working correctly and alexa not understanding what i¡¯m saying  especially because i do not have an accent  and i get a lot of i do not know that  from alexa
7635,14,it has done everything i have tried
7636,14,has good sound for its size.  alexa voice is a little ok.  she understands most commands.  does not work with my phillips smart bulbs as reliably as apple homekit.  has trouble connecting and understanding what room i want to turn on
7637,11,it is amazing step up for me from the echo dot to the new echo 2nd gen is amazing! speakers are great! duno why people are giving bad reviews about it. my option is ¡°awesome¡± :))
7638,10,"this is by far one of the best investment i¡¯ve me in quite some time. it is great when i¡¯m working from home because i can set reminders for myself, listen to the news, or stream radio while i¡¯m working."
7639,14,i love my echo. alexa has no problem understanding everyone in my household. i can not wait to get more smart home integrated devices to connect. the sound quality on this is amazing for music and parties.
7640,14,"it is probably very good, but it does not recognize my wifi connection.  need help.  have tried numerous times to pair my echo with my wi-fi to no avail."
7641,12,we are enjoying it very much
7642,5,wife loves it as christmas gift..
7643,10,"we love alexa, simple set up planned to use mostly for music but hope she can help us to be a little more organized too!"
7644,1,great fun.  we love this. it works great.
7645,14,"alexa is a pain in the butt, the software lacks so much intuition."
7646,14,love this thing....a handy gadget.....had a little trouble getting it hooked up to my wifi but called support and that did the trick.  was very surprised at the great quality of sound from such little speakers!  i imagine this would be quite useful for someone who is blind.
7647,9,love it!
7648,10,i absolutely love this gadget. it is so much easier to just ask alexa a question than to get out my phone and look it up on there.
7649,14,"if you have prime, fire and music with amazon it is great! takes tweaking to work with other apps. read the fine print they record every command!"
7650,10,i love requesting music of all genres without dealing with cds. still learning how to use it.
7651,10,fantastic purchase! we purchased 2 at the same time and are able to enjoy it in multiple areas of our home.
7652,8,love it
7653,1,great sound
7654,4,love it! easy to set up and use! great sound quality!
7655,9,it is one of the most amazing things in my household.  i do not think i will ever run out of things for it to do!
7656,14,"iphone app did not have easy setup, but eventually was able to get alexia to work.  not my favorite purchase and would not purchase again."
7657,14,"i am so happy i purchased this item! great sound, easy to use. so glad i did not get a satellite radio. i just connected the echo to on online sirius account and used prime music. very happy."
7658,8,it is wonderful. we love it
7659,0,it is nice to ask and it will play your songunfortunately you have to have premium service to get some groups
7660,12,a lot to learn on how to use echo
7661,11,like the smaller size...
7662,1,great sound quality for the price.
7663,14,will be playing music and just stops.  will continue to try to program echo more to see if it will work better.surprised that it was $20 cheaper when i checked the computer the next day.  disappointed  i was charged full price<f0><u+009f><u+0099><u+0081>
7664,12,"met all my expectations, had no negative problems."
7665,9,"this a great sound system, wonderful to have around the house. great for kids or college kids. they use it to help them with there homework."
7666,1,sounds is good.  alexa is responsive.
7667,3,life = better with alexa
7668,14,the fact that i can stream music thru entire house and garage via 1 echo & 4 dots along with 2 surround systems already in place + internet access at sound of voice...awesome
7669,1,love this echo speaker is awesome works great
7670,1,lots of fun!  i like the music available to me.  sound is really good!
7671,4,easy setup. great sound. handy for information.
7672,4,the sound quality totally exceeded my expectations.  very easy to use.  wish it worked with directv
7673,14,the echo has great sound.  music sounds great.  have lights and our shark robot controlled by echo.
7674,1,"the sound is clear and vibrant, so music is wonderful."
7675,14,echo is an awesome fun product. and alexa is too. very easy to setup for a technical person like me but i have to believe 90% of buyer can get echo working in 30 -60 minutes. love to music choices and sound. i even have it streaming via bluetooth to my whole house audio system.
7676,9,"i mostly use it to play music & it sounds amazing, music fills up the whole room"
7677,10,"very high tech in doing things. turning on lights, music, weather, facts and anything else you could think of. least favorite thing - anyone in house could tell alexa to order or buy something from your amazon account."
7678,9,we love the echo! this was a gift formy husband who does not do computers! so all he has to do is ask and he receives the info he wants!!
7679,10,i need to learn more about it but i love asking for music and it plays the songs i want!
7680,9,just love it. ordering more for family
7681,1,love it!!! we are an echo family! the sound on this one is a great quality!
7682,1,new look
7683,10,"i absolutely love my echo! i love having music at a voice command.i love asking questions, having a timer, and weather at will. the music sounds great!"
7684,0,amazing....almost scary!  it delivers nearly everything you ask for......except it occasionally does not understand the request - no matter how distinctly and clearly you ask.
7685,10,"i am really enjoying the new echo.  i also appreciate the regular emails i receive on how to use it, questions to ask, etc.  i wish i knew more about how to set it up to interact with my other electronics - i just have not had time to research it."
7686,8,great.
7687,14,i love it! she was so easy to set up and responds to requests with few challenges......
7688,1,"looks good, and excellent sound!"
7689,1,great
7690,9,finaly had to purchase echo after friend said she was having so much fun. she was right.
7691,9,love my alexa.
7692,0,i love it!  i really did not expect to use it much but i keep finding new things to ask.....you should give it a try.
7693,14,"i am in love with alexa.  she does almost everything i ask her to do.  if i could just get her to wash the windows....she will play music, turn on the light in a dark room and play games with me."
7694,0,i love it!! we use it every single day!the only thing that i struggle with is having her understand my first question each time i ask. she will 100% get in the 2nd try.
7695,14,most of the skills suck and it would be nice to have a male and female voice for alexa. also it sucks at recognizing the word echo and has a hard with words that start with ru. native support for ps4 and xbox one would be nice and all comcast x1 boxes
7696,9,love it so much i got  another for my daughters too.
7697,0,she likes my husband more than me! but now she knows who is in charge!!
7698,4,easy to use and set up. love the style and color.
7699,0,found out there are monthly fees involved or can not get all the music we like.
7700,4,the sound is great!
7701,8,love it!
7702,11,greatly improved sound.
7703,8,i love alexa!
7704,14,love it . i have her controlling lights making lists i even dropped in on me son in a different city and talked with him. just cant het her to acknowledge my schedule. she is also a great speller.
7705,11,"excellent device, sound quality was not noticeably improved from earlier version."
7706,10,absolutely love it!  great sound.  great size.  great style.  make sure to download the amazon alexa app for additional features and functions.
7707,10,i love how she greets me in the morning when i say alexa good morning and informs me of the history of this date..love how i can ask her most anything and get answersthe sound is greatand i can call my daughter on echo2 as she has an echo also
7708,14,much improved over the 1st generation. no more shouting at alexa to get her attention when she is playing music.
7709,5,i love it.  my son and i have a blast with it.
7710,14,alexa taught me how to pronounce sia properly.
7711,8,i love my alexa.
7712,10,"love alexa, use it everyday for music, reminders & lists!"
7713,10,very easy to set up. i find that the phone app has helped me get more versatility frommthe echo. great sound.
7714,9,it is so much fun.  i got it as a present and did not have any idea of what it was.  now i use it all the time.
7715,10,i absolutely love this echo.  i use it as a timer and of course for music. but i really love the quizzes in vocabulary and all the fun different activities you can use echo for.  and there is so much more i have not yet discovered.
7716,14,"quick shipping, like the sound and volume it puts out. i recommend spending the extra money over the dot for quality of sound. i use it daily to play my music with my prime account."
7717,14,it lives up to the hype for sure. it is nice to have most of what info you may need readily available just by asking. it does seem to have a tough time differentiating between certain commands though. that is something i am sure they will clear up with updates.
7718,1,this is a great addition to my home.
7719,10,i am enjoying alexa.  this product is a convient while sitting outside on the patio.  i have recommended this product to friends and family. i am very satisfied.
7720,14,worked great from the start. directions were great no trial and error. unlike the mini little dot a royal pain in the a**!
7721,10,i love it!!!! the sound is amazing!!! love jamming to music while cleaning the house!!!
7722,10,great system and an easy way to listen to music.
7723,9,everyone should have a few.
7724,14,the sound is improved; however the voice recognition is not as good as the first generation. i usually have to mute my tv for it to recognize me; while this was not necessary on my older one.
7725,10,love it..more especially with it is capacity and abiility to access generational and time period music..
7726,11,"do not notice much of a difference between 2nd gen and 1st gen, except the 2nd gen is very ""buggy."" i will await updates from amazon..."
7727,11,i like the sound. it is louder as use it. i use my echo mostly for music. the voice recognition is good also. i love it.
7728,8,great sound
7729,14,"to be honest, i had no idea what to expect. i first saw echo at a friend is house and i liked the convenience of being able to obtain information and music in a matter of minutes. the sound is fine and i like the size."
7730,10,"love it. i can listen to all my music on pandora, you tube by blootooth and my tablet. very happy with my purchase. great sound, very easy to program with my accounts."
7731,14,"i just ordered my 3rd echo (echo 1st gen, echo show, echo 2nd gen). they are an excellent way to enjoy music, control your smart home, and get daily news, sports and weather information. the sound quality is excellent and they are intuitive and very easy to use."
7732,11,we bought it at the same time as homepod. it is much more versatile. and sound is great for a small speaker. along with 1/3 the price of honepod.
7733,10,"good morning, i love my echo. i use it all the time. the best $79 i ever spent.i use it at least 3 times a day when preparing meals. fantastic!!!!!"
7734,0,i love the sound. and it does not take up a lot of room. i really love it.
7735,11,"could not possibly love this more! the sound quality is remarkable, too."
7736,11,all
7737,0,it is cool to have but can become frustrating once you have to repeat yourself several times. it also stops working at times  (with red rings blinking) stops taking commands and randomly stops playing  a song out of nowhere. still fun to ask alexa a joke or story here and there.
7738,10,love it
7739,14,when it works it is fine. seems to get tired and stop after a few hours of music
7740,10,"i am just amazed as to how intelligent alexa is. since i have not had her long, i am still learning all of what she can do! my only wish is that i could personalize her to a name of my choosing. just a really great product and worth every penny!"
7741,5,my son-in-law loves this!
7742,14,fine
7743,10,i like this a lot.  i give alexa my grocery list and its entered into my phone.  i do not need a shopping list anymore.  plays music while i clean and cook.
7744,8,sounds great!
7745,12,really enjoy listening to music on my echo.  the sound is amazing on the 2nd generation.  experimenting with all the fun things alexa can do.
7746,10,love it a lot.
7747,0,disappointed. alexa does not have an extensive knowledge base as siri.
7748,2,love echo.
7749,8,love it
7750,8,love it!
7751,10,"this is my first echo. i do hair professionally out of my home and it has been fun for my clients to pick their own music to enjoy.i have not explored all its functions yet, but we had fun with all the x-mas jokes. thinking about getting another!"
7752,10,oh alexa!
7753,1,works great.  sounds great.
7754,10,love alexa. it looks great and does whatever i ask. great product will be buying more for rooms when we get into our new home
7755,3,would buy again loved it
7756,11,love it.would definetly recommend. way better then first gen sound is more deeper and rich.
7757,1,excellent sound quality and voice recognition.
7758,0,i do like my alexa i also like the emails i get on questions to ask alexa it is a work in progress but i am sure i will get accosomed to it & will enjoy it even more
7759,0,"just something fun to have.  i do not use it as much as other people - no smart tv, etc.  but she is fun to talk to and ask questions of."
7760,10,this is a birthday gift. it was easy to install. i can even access my audible account. what fun to get weather and news while waking up.
7761,1,we love our echo!  the sound from the speaker is amazing!!
7762,9,this is a must-have product for everyone comes in handy
7763,5,gave as a gift! my friend loves it!
7764,14,"i love it and have integrated it with our sonos system, great solution!!"
7765,13,greatest
7766,1,it is ok
7767,10,"bought a second one for my bathroom.  i love getting ready in the morning while listening to my favorite music.  with amazon music, i can have alexa play whatever i am in the mood for.  a great way to start my day."
7768,8,exelent
7769,9,"my kids love them. my son uses it for his alarm clock, as a timer, to tell jokes and of course to play all his music."
7770,10,love echo.  go to sleep every night to the sounds of the ocean.
7771,0,best thing i own!
7772,0,"echo is convenient for weather, scores, very general questions. i do not know how all these people get more use out of alexa. when i ask for a boston radio station, i get houston. i get more "" i do not know that"" answers than good answers."
7773,2,absolutely love my echo.
7774,12,fun and interesting device.
7775,14,i love music thats why i love alexa. my echo is playing almost the whole day so its really worth it for me the down side for me is it still needs a little sound improvements. but still 5 stars for me.
7776,10,"amazing! the sound is crisp and clear. alexa is very responsive and i¡¯m utterly impressed with various function. i rely on alexa for up to date news, weather and traffic on my daily commute; everyday!"
7777,0,"loved the sound of the musicnice can get weather, news briefing and set timers.hate that 90% of the time i ask a question the response is i do not know that one. very dissapointingi will ask my google the same questions  and 100% of the time get the answer."
7778,11,"like it being small in size, seems to have the same sound as my first and larger one. enjoy the convenience of the apps!"
7779,14,it is great you can use your bluetooth to play your music off your iphone
7780,2,love everything about my alexa.
7781,5,it was given as a gift and my friend loves it!
7782,5,got this for my dad as a christmas present. he loves it!
7783,8,awesome
7784,0,sound is great! now i just have to teach alexa a thing or two
7785,10,"awesome, it is a new world"
7786,8,love it!
7787,14,if you do not have amazon music it can be annoying.
7788,0,"i really like the voice activation and the number of things that it can do, such as setting timers, grocery list, etc.  am not overly impressed with the music available without having to pay extra fees and it does not recognize certain other programs like pandora or directtv"
7789,1,looks good and works well.  good sound.
7790,11,blends in nicely with wood tone. sounds amazing. does not like close proximity to another unit. still learning.
7791,11,like this better than google home.
7792,1,great product. very versatile in all its functions.
7793,1,awesome. love how loud this little thing it!
7794,10,the music selection is wow and the sound is beautiful and love asking her question and she is so nice to have so much u can and the grandkids love her also. thank you for a great priduct! ask her anything and if she dont know she will let u know and she has personality.
7795,9,i bought this for my 10 year old and he loves it.  mainly uses it for listening to music but has fun asking questions.  the sound is great.
7796,4,easy to set up good sound quality.
7797,10,i have this and the dot. i love it. i will be adding more dots later. i never sleep through my alarms now i always know the weather ....ect...ect. i am not a prime member yet but will definitely be getting it to do more with her.
7798,0,"it is wonderful. can listen to my favorite songs, and singers. just have to be careful that no one mentions her name within hearing distance as she will answer and surprise you."
7799,4,fun to use and useful.
7800,9,love this thing.  we received it as a gift from our son.  added unlimited music and now control lights etc.
7801,3,works as expected.
7802,10,i really enjoy requesting assistance from alexa!! she is great!
7803,11,i absolutely love this 2nd generation sound by dolby!  i returned a first gen. because of the poor sound.  this has surpassed my expectations.  and alexa app is getting better and better!
7804,9,great item.  have 3 of the echo dots & now using the intercom feature as well
7805,9,i love this product!  everyone needs one!!
7806,10,alexa is great love the fact i can get a rundown of my day and top news and turn lights on and off and listen to music..
7807,5,christmas gift for my daughter for christmas. she loves it
7808,10,"it recognizes my voice, helps me with reminders and i can have a conversation with it!"
7809,9,our family loves our echo
7810,5,christmas present for my sil and he loved it.
7811,12,"love it!! so useful, helpful and fun!!"
7812,10,love my alexa so great to have some much info hands free!!
7813,5,my son loves his new alexia.
7814,0,wish it understood more but has a great music feature
7815,0,i love the echo and listening to my pandora music. i like learning a new language.  the thing i like least is the learning curve involved in having to remember to say alexa
7816,1,great product - acoustics are good for its size.
7817,5,bought this for my mom on christmas day. she is thrilled to have the latest version
7818,1,very happy with this.  good speaker quality.
7819,10,"i am in love with alexa, she is my new friend!"
7820,14,"sounds great, can hardly wait to grow into it!"
7821,0,hard at first to get used to but the more you use the better it gets.
7822,11,what is not to love?!!
7823,0,"i love having music,news updates,weather report, instantly,when i ask.i have fun playing some of the games and asking questions.i have not  find anything to least like yet.i will most likely take the next step up in service for an even better experience."
7824,0,alexa is stupid and not worth the moneyfail
7825,9,"i got the echo for christmas. i am really surprised at how much i love it. my son and i listen to the radio in the mornings before heading out, we play games and so much more.  my 9 year old son even uses it independently.  definately a great gift for anyone!"
7826,14,"alexa is not powered by google therefore, she does not know alot. my expectations were much higher than what is being delivered. hopefully in the very near future alexa will have much more information available to draw from. on the positive side the sound quality is decent."
7827,0,a gift
7828,10,fun and helpful. never thought we would get much use out of it but we use alexa daily!
7829,4,great sound
7830,10,"i like it very much. plays great quality sound, fills the entire room."
7831,1,great product!
7832,0,"love my alexa! the funny thing is when i talk to my daughter alexis, alexa responds with ¡° i¡¯m not to sure about that¡±."
7833,14,"i love this and it is quite easy to set up, the speaker sounds amazing, and it is easy to use. i do wish the instruction booklet explained more of the various tasks alexa is able to accomplish, as opposed to me needing to research it on my own."
7834,14,not exactly bwtter than a smart phone.
7835,12,received this as a gift and absolutely love all that alexa can do.  still learning a lot.
7836,0,we love our echo. we use it mainly for music. my only complaint is that alexa seems to have a hard time understanding my husband.
7837,9,"this is an excellent product. i am legally blind, and this device give me many tools to use to make my life easier!"
7838,14,change you wake word to ¡°computer¡± and walla! you¡¯re on the bridge of the enterprise.
7839,10,i love it and i have not even begun to use all the features!  mainly i found out that i could bluetooth it as my sound bar! amazing quality!
7840,14,perhaps it is something i am not understanding even though she says that she connected...nothing!  i have tried resetting and again nothing after saying finish setup!?!
7841,14,"it is a great home system and it has some of the best speakers for its size however,the monotony of getting an amazon account and setting up is a bit tedious. overall,still a fantastic system. it is a 4.25/5 for me."
7842,0,i.  am somewhat disappointed in the echo.  it ten des nt understand what we have said.  i as free get told that she ¡°does not know that¡±.
7843,0,does what it says it does.  keep hoping it could do more ...
7844,14,"love it ! great to get info on the go, music on command. love dan carlin history but it needs work to pause and resume plus a way of o add additional pod casts"
7845,1,"excellent sound quality. like the size of the unit. nice looking, so it blends in well with our furnishings."
7846,11,does not sound as good as the first gen imo.
7847,5,my family  loves it
7848,10,"so fun! i use it for the daily weather, jokes, my shopping list, music when i am cooking. so much fun."
7849,2,my second echo and i love love love it!!!!
7850,5,this was a gift for my son.
7851,11,it works.  sound is ok.  i wish it had some bass.  all in all its a good device i just wish there was a premium sound version with full alexa functionality.  for example the sonos one but with full functionality.
7852,9,"this was a christmas present from our son & daughter-in-law. we enjoyed it while visiting them, so they gave us one for christmas. we are amazed at how quickly alexa is able to play a wide variety of music at our request with great sound quality."
7853,10,easy to install.  still learning the various functions.  the sound is great.
7854,14,it is not working so well each time a i get a email to my tablet that are connected to echo it stop it function and i have to start asking again for music or any other task echo is doingvery bad
7855,14,"it replies to my questions clearly - great for solving crossword puzzles.  words that have a pronunciation of a word that has two spellings and, obviously two meanings, can present a problem.  i have managed to solve the situation most of the time."
7856,14,good job
7857,10,for the most part this is a fun product
7858,10,it is easy to connect and sounds great!it knows more than my wife.
7859,3,had item for a little more than a week and love it!
7860,9,alexa is wonderful! everyone should have at least one!!!
7861,0,it does what it says it does
7862,9,gift
7863,0,it can answer most questions but the single most thing i use it for is to remind me of special events.
7864,8,i love it
7865,1,works fantastic
7866,11,really great sound and can pick up voice queues from across the room
7867,14,it does not work very well. i thought i would get more out of it. more frustrating than useful. made a big mistake purchasing it!
7868,14,this thing is awesome!! some times you just need to be clear with commands. it is better if you have more then 1 to communicate through the house.
7869,10,i love this! easy and quick access to just about any question. love the music!!!!!!
7870,9,"love my echos and echo plus. i have 4 placed throughout my home so when i play music, it sounds like it is coming from everywhere. have received many compliments on the quality of sound. of course i also use alexa for my lights."
7871,14,i enjoy the versatility of the music available. i live in area where radio reception was always problem. that is no longer the case with echo.
7872,1,works great
7873,14,"i liked the echo so much, i bought 3 more for all the rooms in my house. ¡°drop in¡± is soooo much easier than yelling to the other end of the house or having to walk to my work shop. the only thing i would change is the ability to add a custom ¡°wake up¡± word."
7874,0,its ok takes some getting used to so she understands but good product.  is really good for music and shopping lists.
7875,9,loved mine so much decided to buy my mother one for xmas!
7876,14,"i just love this thing,its alwsome.took me awhile to figure out the setup but in the end i got it to work.thank,s amazon."
7877,11,like the dot just better sound
7878,10,i liked everything on my echo! i added the additional music and was overwhelmed by the jazz tunes and artists it knows. i am a fan of all genres however jazz is me. i tried to stump her each day.  she is winning
7879,11,great sound. i miss the rotating bezel of the earlier generation but buttons are ok.
7880,1,we love it.
7881,10,absolutely love it.  especially the trivia and music at the drop of a hat
7882,4,sounds great. easy to use.
7883,12,so far i love it!
7884,11,a bit disappointed with the speaker volume. i find the smaller echo better.
7885,10,amazing sound.  i also purchased amazon music which has given me access to such a wide variety of music.  we use our echo everyday!  love it!
7886,14,"originally saw this as an unnecessary toy, but quickly became a fan of smart home technology. alexa and smart light bulbs are a great combination. at least it is a start and something more than "" alexa tell me a joke"". i am not that desperate for company."
7887,4,"ease of set up, use and sound quality are all great with this.  love it."
7888,10,"it is great. i use it to turn on/off all my lamps, tv, ac, and more. great stuff!"
7889,10,"i absolutely love my echo 2nd generation. the sound is amazing and i can ask alexa to play any kind of music or playlist. i also love the fact that you can use it to ask questions, set the alarm and control your smart devices. it is absolutely worth it and it is affordable."
7890,0,i love how good the sound is but what i dont like is how out of nowhere the echo just starts talking when no one said her name very strange and would hope that people arnt hacking it and listening to our convos and iv had couple friends say the same thing.
7891,1,great item works cool
7892,11,i like the product i wish the voice activation was a bit more sensitive. i feel like i have to yell in order to get a response. and the sound quality is deceased but in no way compares to my jbl or bose mini speakers.
7893,4,"i liked the size, sound , quick/easy operation once it was set up!"
7894,0,"answers about 25% of my basic simple questions ... more of a novelty item. good thing i got this as a christmas present and did not pay for it, as i would have returned it ..."
7895,1,"great price, design, and sound. love it!"
7896,1,like it very much the sound is great coming out of it.
7897,4,love my alexa. great sound and very informative
7898,1,love the dolby sound!
7899,9,we love our echo. have had fun with it.
7900,14,i love it. my husband and i was just playing around and he said out loud alexa i''m sorry. and the echo talked back saying that is ok. we fell out laughing.  i have not learn everything there is to learn about it but we love the sound of the music
7901,11,sound is not as good as first generation.  i returned it and ordered the original echo and much happier.
7902,10,"love the music available,  alarms, sleep sounds."
7903,10,"love my echo ! this device is great and makes my life easier. from music, to orders, to general knowledge, to controlling my lights etc..."
7904,0,i think it is a lot of fun to have but you have to down load the apps and pay for music.  the commercial does not tell you that!  you have to be willing to do all of that!
7905,8,great .  love it
7906,14,what i like about the echo ii is the crisp and clean sound it delivers . i does not take up a lot of space also with the amazon fire tablet hd what more could you ask for ?just love it ...
7907,0,"love that it is ready to go at all times. i can play music and get weather/news reports. still trying to figure out how to incorporate my dominos app into it, but have not really spent the time to do so. i just like knowing that she is there."
7908,14,"it starts on its own sometimes, it rarely has the info you ask it and the bass is too deep for sound without an eq.  i also am concerned by it prying recording capability. is it hackable so that i end up with an accidental microphone in my house all the time?"
7909,8,love.
7910,14,"dang! and i was just a week ahead of getting the $20 off discount! oh well, i still love it. my favorite part is the sound output jack. thanks for that improvement amazon!"
7911,2,great product. love my echo
7912,10,i absolutely love my echo it is just so nice to ask somebody a question and the answer ! i love the unlimited variety of music i just could not stop the cleani i love the unlimited variety of music it plays when i ask i just think it is just a fabulous invention.
7913,5,received as a gift!! absolutely love!!!
7914,10,"we were late coming to the game but this is a great device. you can keep your grocery list, play music on our sonus system."
7915,12,best thing ever so much to do just got to learn the skills love it
7916,1,it is a lot of fun.  the speakers are excellent.
7917,0,she sure does say i am not sure a lot when u ask her a question. she sings and tells u jokes
7918,14,"we love our new echo.  the sound quality is good and we can even pair it up with bluetooth speakers if we want to rock out.  still trying things out with alexa, but we like her so far.  i do think she is listening even when not activated, so we unplug her when not in use."
7919,1,great product.
7920,1,love it
7921,0,like everything she does. one thing that frustrates us is when she responds to tv commercials for echo.
7922,10,"i love my echo! alexa is so fun and convenient. my husband and i love listening to music while we work around the house and now it is as simple as ""alexa, play __ on pandora!"""
7923,14,bought this unit as a gift for someone in jamaica. very disappointed that its functionality is materially limited even though the recipient has an amazon account.  it would be useful if this limitation was declared in the description.  expect better from amazon
7924,14,difficult to setup if you already have paid for other services and getting them to cooperate with each other and or understand the others uses. apple setup resource not easy.
7925,9,fantastic! we love our echo and enjoy the wide rage of uses. we might buy a second one for our basement we love it so much.
7926,0,most of the songs i request are rock. and i iike to turn the volume way up. the volume is not near loud enough for me. i wish there wasa way to up the volume.i do enjoy employing some of the suggestions i receive from amazon regarding questions i can ask alexa.
7927,1,"works great, love the color."
7928,0,its alright.  thank you for asking
7929,0,nice for when i just want to play music or have the echo call my phone (i place it random places and can not find it alot). i got the echo as a gift..so i am a little concerned that amazon is asking me for a review...how does amazon know i did not gift it to someone else???
7930,14,"i love the sound & the first 3 month free subscription for the music...i do not like the fact that after 3 months, it will be $9.99/month...that is a bit much for me to continue on. i like alexa & all the questions she can answer & respond to."
7931,9,"this thing is, well, fun. a lot. get one!"
7932,1,love love love it. fun and works really well.
7933,1,echo is a great techy item to ave in my home. alexa is fun and informative.
7934,10,i absolutely love this thing. i  get all the info i need for my day as well as all of my favorite music.
7935,0,"i did not  know what expect, i never had one before. i know i am very please with alexa echo 2,i also bought smart plugs to go with her and when i tell her ot turn on and off the lights she does, she plays music and so much more, i am still figuring out what all she does."
7936,1,works great!
7937,1,excellent quality and sound.
7938,0,over overall i am pleased with the sound was impressive and just you know the easy accessibility to knowledge and anything you need to know right at your voice command is pretty cool and impressive and the amazon music app for 399 a month is pretty good too
7939,5,purchased as a gift for 85 year old mother --- she absolutely loves it ...
7940,1,"love it,very handy and also fun!"
7941,14,"pro:  the new, compact design looks great, and the sandstone cover blends in nicely with our furnishings.  the microphones have much better range - alexa can now hear me clearly from our entire downstairs and from the top of the stairs.  alexa also does not seem to accidentally trigger as much when hearing random conversations.cons:  significantly degraded audio quality as compared to the 1st generation echo.  alexa sounds like she is speaking to you from under a metal bucket.  music has stronger bass, but higher range is muddled and some vocal tracks are difficult to understand.  i removed the fabric cover to see if that was the issue but only heard a minor improvement.  the echo is by no means designed to be a high-end speaker, but for general, all-around music enjoyment, the 1st gen echo clearly has the edge.  one other minor annoyance - when disconnected from wifi, the 2nd gen takes twice as long to reconnect."
7942,1,happy with the sound and the convenience of an echo.
7943,14,"the sound quality is not as great as echo advertised. set up process was not as user friendly as i hoped.  it was challenging especially when it came to the plug. probably should have waited for improvements to be made on future  ""generations"" before purchasing."
7944,4,very entertaining and helpful!
7945,5,she da best
7946,14,"i bought the echo dot for my husband for christmas.... loved it so much 4 days later ordered echo 2nd generation. if you have not experienced alexa, you do not know what your missing!"
7947,11,"it is a very good improvement.  the sound quality is better, but should have been even better .  unless that was your plan, for the next generation.  i¡¯m yhinking of buying another."
7948,0,"i am still figuring our what exactly what to do with it, but i like it! i want to talk to all of the things in my house an tell them to do stuff. if nothing else, it is an awesome speaker!"
7949,10,"really enjoy alexa.i am constantly looking up stuff on internet, she makes it easier.and love the shopping list.no longer write one and leave it home"
7950,0,it is awesome....but would be better if it only listened to me....i am the supreme commander of alexa....therefore i should overrule everyone when it comes to what she does.
7951,10,i love her up in the morning and having her tell me s what is happening this day. i also love having her make calls for me.......
7952,0,it is very nice and amazing you will not feel boring anymore
7953,8,great product
7954,10,"i am absolutely amazed every time i use it. alexa is 'ai' experience is phenomenal, decent sound quality. definitely one of my best gadget purchase ever.quick, responsive and on point. play music, news, weather,"
7955,0,coulnd't llve without alexas anymore!  the sound is perfect and the size of it.  good buy!
7956,14,"works really well overall! sometimes i may experience an issue in connection from time to time but the issue is rare and can be fixed simply be replugging the echo back in the wall outlet. overall very satisfied, but there is always room for improvement."
7957,1,great sound from a small package!
7958,4,"great product, very entertaining.  was all i anticipated and more"
7959,1,works just fine
7960,1,great addition to the home.  very good quality.  we are very pleased
7961,11,thought  the sound quality would be better than his previous version  sounds about the same to me in reality do not need to buy this one
7962,1,great!
7963,10,we are enjoying asking questions of alexa!
7964,4,"entertaining, fun to use."
7965,11,100 % improvement we love it the sound is great
7966,4,very easy to use. looks nice and clean.
7967,8,love it
7968,4,"easy setup, easy to use. instructions vague."
7969,0,need to be more savvy with what she does.  find it difficult
7970,9,our alexa was a gift to ourselves after seeing it at our daughters.  we were amazed what we could ask and alexa knew the answer. so happy with ours that we gifted one to our son and daughter-in-law! think they love there is too!
7971,0,alexa is great.  she tells me if celebrities are alive or not or if the person on the tv show is actually who i think they are. she is pretty reliable with the weather and she listens when i want the volume louder. she was also super handy during the olympics.
7972,1,this thing is easy to use. the speakers sound great!
7973,2,"i like everything about my, echo 2nd generation."
7974,8,love it !!
7975,14,the quality of the sound is not as good as i had hoped for but i am enjoying it nevertheless
7976,5,my daughter loves it!  it works great!
7977,10,"easy to set up, i play pandora and my local radio station, use it for my shopping list & to-do list, weather, news, general questions. i¡¯ve had it for a month so i¡¯m still learning what else i can use it for."
7978,14,love the echo. works great with the amazon cloud cam and with wemo for the lamps.
7979,0,"i love the fantastic sound it has. i can play music on it really loud and the sound is still great. i love pretty much everything about it.i do wish it had a larger knowledge base, and do not like having to ask questions a certain way"
7980,14,the sound is great. setup was a pain since my router is not close to where i want echo.
7981,10,"probably the best amazon purchase i have made.  you can get local weather, local news, and stream your music.highly recommend."
7982,8,love it
7983,9,amazing!  i have linked this to so many of my home devices.  it is like a universal remote for your home!  nice sound quality as well! i am purchasing the echo dot for our bedroom.!
7984,10,"this thing is amazing, i forget it is next to me at times!!! so easy to check weather and to set alarm!"
7985,1,love this - the sound is amazing!
7986,5,great gift
7987,0,it has good sound.  we expected more general answers to questions than we get.  it is very good when given a command.
7988,14,"good with daily random questions. has a good speaker and able to project quality sound at high volume levels, but its inability to connect to other music apps makes it very limited. hopefully they open it up to these other music apps soon. (i use youtube red for music)"
7989,14,alone.
7990,0,hard to program
7991,11,"fantastic... simply fantastic!the small cylinder has an spectacular 360¨¬ sound, which fills a room perfectly."
7992,10,i love my echoes!  it is a lovely way to have music playing all through the house.
7993,8,great
7994,14,i could not get it to work with my system
7995,8,love it
7996,9,i just bought this for my wife is birthday and she loves it!  it was very easy to set up the echo through the app and she instantly got our spotify account attached.  she is still playing with it and learning new things everyday but so far she loves it.
7997,9,2nd echo for me and i love them!
7998,1,sound is great
7999,14,"i do not use it much as i found out that others (others, both private and corporate, can hack into echo, turn on the mic, and listen to household conversations."
8000,11,"could not be more pleased! works amazing, super easy to set up and the wood cover is so pretty!!"
8001,12,so far i love it!  still learning about all the features.
8002,10,"my first alexa device and i love it!  got the buttons too to play games, but have not used them much yet."
8003,10,myself and my wife spent a lot of time checking the weather and playing music. my wife really likes it we are still experimenting with the workings of the echo system write a still new to us but we like it also the echo dot
8004,9,"getting hooked and dependent on alexa now,,, thanks echo!"
8005,14,"i never write negative reviews, but you need to understand that this echo/alexa system does't work as advertised. bought it for my kid is room, some things work and others do not, even though i have installed and uninstalled the skills many times. skills are what let you connect the echo and alexa to other things and technologies that are approved by amazon. i bought all my connected devices from amazon to make sure they where alexa/echo compatible and still their are many problems. the nest ac system does not connect properly even though i follow every instruction, the same with the sonos audio system and the tp-link light switch. it has been frustrating, thinking on returning the devices after everything was bought and unpacked."
8006,9,i love our echo/alexa. we love asking her questions. and she has a sarcastic streak!
8007,9,"alexa does everything i want her to do. very clear, still learning a lot of the apps. so much fun. my husband was amazed on christmas morning he told alexa merry christmas and she responded with same to you. he about fell out of his chair."
8008,14,"i was skeptical of the whole echo concept. i gave it a try, though, and i really like it.  the voice recognition is reliable, the whole concept is very convenient, and the speaker even has good sound quality."
8009,0,only because i¡¯m still learning what it can do. also having some troubles connecting to smart lights. seems very limited to what it can do on its own without your phone connected. other then that it is really cool. tells funny jokes and stories.
8010,9,love alexa ! given as gift and we learn something new everyday ;
8011,10,love it! listen to music and use the shopping list most.  very easy to connect.
8012,11,good. like the original better though
8013,11,love this thing! had one of the original larger versions and as far as i can tell it is as good or better. i can not tell a difference in the sound quality or loudness and i was okay with the original so definitely would buy again.
8014,8,love it.
8015,3,thank you
8016,14,love alexa.  we have the dot and brought the echo for our parents for christmas.  however cannot connect it to their wifi.  still trying to track the problem.
8017,10,great product. i added unlimited music. speaker is good.discovering new things every day. i constantly use it as a cooking timer.
8018,1,it is sooooo fun and really good speaker!
8019,10,¡°santa¡± brought alexa for my son and i think his mother has taken it over.  i like walking in the room and asking to play a song that is right on my mind and there it is.  my son asks for the joke of the day!
8020,0,"great sound system, but alexa has very limited range of skills, and is picky about the ways that you say things. overall pretty great but crazy frustrating sometimes."
8021,0,love it. sometimes alexa has a hard time understanding some songs which is very annoying. and you must pay for amazon music to stream but at least you get a discount.
8022,9,so impressed i purchased a second
8023,11,"love the echo. have 5 devices in the house, and the echo has improved audio quality which makes it great for whole home audio."
8024,14,received this as a christmas gift. it is cool. trying to grasp the point in having the device at all. i do not like that it ¡°ha to be plugged in to function
8025,1,looks great and works great and sounds great. a lot of apps to have fun with and works well with my growing smart home.
8026,4,great sound.  easy to program. i love it. so happy
8027,9,we do not use alexa much for q&a but we like the selection of music and the sound is pretty good. it was a great gift from our kids.
8028,10,the kids are having lots of fun with this. we love that we can listen to all kinds of music. oh and calling from it is great too.
8029,14,"overall this is a fun gadget. however the big downfall is the fact that it does not sync with our bose speaker to give us more of a surround sound feel.  you have to chose sound from one or the other, not both."
8030,2,we love our echo.great product
8031,10,our entire family loves alexa. it was so easy to connect her to wi-fi and set her up in general. it amazes me how such a small speaker device can produce amazing tunes. highly recommend.
8032,3,life changer. use it for everything. sound quality is great.
8033,10,i love it it works great keeps the nsa totally up to date with everything in my day today lol just kidding alexa works perfect for making lists and keeping my day today schedule organized and on point
8034,9,a breeze to set up and a joy to use. the sound fills the room. very happy with the echo!
8035,10,we love the music. we sit and listen to all of our favorite artists from when we were young until present. but i hope she picked the wrong team to win the super bowl.
8036,12,we are enjoying learning to use it.
8037,10,my family and i are throughly enjoying our amazon echo we got for christmas. there is no limit to the amount t of skills and ifttt interactions we can equip her with. alexa has been a joy to use and get to know.
8038,9,love this and my family does to. so far we¡¯ve used it as a timer and for music in the family room¡¯
8039,10,"we love this. my children and i just started it this weekend. we made lots of memories with easy to play great music, making list, alarms and schedules. alexa is making my life better every day"
8040,4,great sound. easy setup online. pairs quickly
8041,0,"it is cool, but not something i really need. though i could also not be using it to its full potential, but i do not want to have to spend more money on other things to use more features. not worth it to me. i can get up to turn off my own lights if necessary."
8042,0,it is like having a roommate almost or just having someone to talk to. i think the one thing i¡¯m a little disappointed with is being able to find music i like but i still give it five stars! thank you alexa!
8043,12,"we have not figured out everything yet, but so far i¡¯m definitely impressed. i love this product.."
8044,12,we love it still new at all it can do. still  learning about the technology of it its fascinating
8045,1,great item
8046,14,"there are very few things that make a difference in our daily lives, like zip lock baggies, velcro, the wheel, well this product is right up there with god i can not believe it is not butter fabulous!"
8047,8,"love, love, love"
8048,9,got for a gift for my grandparents and they love it. i purchased the grey one and it looks really nice and modern in their house.
8049,3,makes life a little more fun and just a bit little easier.
8050,14,"i stopped using the echo.  it proved to be a useless device designed to facilitate illegal purchases.  one, such purchase relating to music charges, was enough for me to realize that the real purpose of echo was to create fraudulent pirchases through amazon."
8051,2,love alexa!!! echo 2 has amazing sound quality love it!
8052,14,it was not really that improved. if you want to make a drastic improvement update the search engine. that function is close to useless.
8053,0,"we barely ever have to search for answers to anything anymore!! ""alexa - thank you"""
8054,11,"as advertised, pretty awesome."
8055,14,good design but alexa does not always work.
8056,9,bought them for the whole family
8057,5,brittney lov' it
8058,8,i love this product
8059,11,"sound quality, ¡°not so much¡±"
8060,7,"love this so much! after reading reviews, did not expect much of sound quality, but with the dolby name, had hope. could not be any more suprised and pleased to hear that sound dolby stands for <f0><u+009f><u+0092><u+00aa><f0><u+009f><u+008f><u+00bc><f0><u+009f><u+0091><u+008f><f0><u+009f><u+0091><u+008d>"
8061,14,"it has been the gift that keeps on giving! we use it all the time for music and to answer random questions. setting it up was a little annoying but once i restarted it, it had worked like a charm."
8062,14,the sound is what i had expected.  the device was somewhat difficult to connect to my wi-fi but not overly complicated.
8063,0,still learning how to use it. it has a few glitches thst needs to be working out
8064,9,love...love it morning noon and night.
8065,12,"still learning all the tricks ""she"" can do. so far, so good."
8066,10,i love my echo.  i have them all over the house!
8067,10,very happy with echo.
8068,11,the 2nd gen echo is fine and is as good as the original but i cannot personally hear the difference in the sound quality. i had no expectations at all that it would sound great and replace a quality sound system so i am totally satisfied with it and it functions as i expected.
8069,14,"i love it.  the appearance, the features and the sound system is excellent.  very quick and accurate responses as well.  the varities of music.  i have not had it that long but intend to get into all of the other features"
8070,14,"it is basically a speaker to play music on. the functions to create grocery lists, set reminders, read a recipe or interact in a help way are cumbersome and make things harder. the technology level does not match the hype."
8071,9,"i love everything about this , it is so amazingly great !! great sound , answers all my questions , it just does so much . now i am wanting to get everything to go with it , lights plugs and other echos to connect to it ."
8072,9,i absolutely love this. my daughter got it for me for christmas because i look up everything! i have gotten so much use out it...with trying to find information to playing music or games with the family. the sound and quality is great!
8073,9,love it.  recommended it to all my friends.great gift idea.
8074,9,it was a great addition to my smart home.  i like it because it hooks with the other one i already have.
8075,11,i love it. speaker is much better than dot
8076,1,excellent!
8077,9,"the sound is clear and very crisp, there is need for an extra speaker. i love my echo, matter of fact i brought two and now thinking about buying one more to accommodate another room in my house."
8078,0,she irritates me most of the time! i¡¯ll ask her to play something and she will play something completely different. nice voice. i¡¯m giving it a three cause i think i can learn to get her to do what i want.
8079,10,love alexa!
8080,8,we love it..
8081,1,great addition to the techno house.  i am very pleased.
8082,8,love it!
8083,0,"great gadget, wish it was more like apple siri"
8084,8,love it works well!
8085,10,"love it, especially calling and se  my grand daughter loves the jokes, she giggles and giggles!nding messages to family!!"
8086,10,i like the sound .  my wife is enjoying the echo more than me.
8087,8,love it!
8088,14,my echo 2nd generation was easy to set up the deal they have with music at below $4 a month is excellent and the sound is also excellent. the price was way below google is home. my wife loves it.
8089,1,the sound quality is excellent.
8090,10,"easy set up. good sound. nice to just ask for an artist and have playlist begin. she helps with weather reports, game questions and traffic information.  no need to google, just ask. we are still getting acquainted, but she is pretty cool!"
8091,14,my daughter loves it. the only concern that there is no filter on songs meaning a parental control for cursing.
8092,10,have had a good time with this device. mainly using it to tune into music and check the weather in the morning as i prep to leave for work. also great with info on local restaurant recommendations. fun to use.
8093,14,i got this for my granddaughter for christmas and she loves it! she had some problems connecting to the wifi but thanks to the alexa echo trouble line it was fixed. this is a great gift for preteens and teens. she loves playing games with alexa!
8094,4,easy setup and nice extra speaker to have around.fun to use
8095,1,quality sound
8096,9,i love it and use it more than i thought i would. it was a pretty awesome gift to receive! especially if you buy a lot of stuff from amazon!
8097,1,love the sound and quality
8098,11,"sounds just as good or better than the gen 1 we purchased a while back. the mic is much improved, ""alexa"" picks up on voice commands much better than the gen 1 device did."
8099,12,awesome
8100,0,"so disappointed. after 4 months, echo is unreliable , unresponsive and totally selective.device shuts down abruptly, very selective in tunes, radio, inquiries and channels"
8101,10,"sounds great! i use it daily -- have it on my kitchen counter and love being able to listen to whatever music i choose while cooking, cleaning, etc. alexa is awesome!"
8102,1,good produce - lots of fun and help!
8103,12,love it so far!
8104,2,i absolutely love my echo
8105,14,"i like it, it is fun and entertaining and i would recommend it.  some of the questions asked alexa could not answer them, but i suppose that is understandable.  overall, i would purchase it again.  playing requested music is a really good feature."
8106,10,love it
8107,0,"alexa is pretty helpful for some little things. i¡¯m very forgetful and it is nice to be able to say ¡°remind me¡± out loud and be reminded automatically, but there are lots of things that would be helpful for her to do that it does not seem like she does."
8108,10,love my echo so much i just got a mini so i could enjoy my echo throughout the house.
8109,2,great sound! love my alexa and compatible products
8110,14,always loses connectivity. my other devices in the same room do not.
8111,14,it felt kinda gimmicky at first but having a voice controlled speaker (with surprisingly good acoustics given it is size) is amazing since all of my favorite music is just a simple voice command away. plus she is a much better wake-up alarm than my phone.
8112,3,sounds great
8113,9,this is so cool. i bought it for my 17 year old grandson.  i am thinking of buying a second one for my husband.
8114,10,"i received the echo as a christmas gift and really like it.  it plays music with great sound, reminds me of appointments and many other things."
8115,8,"excellent i love it , recommended !"
8116,11,even better than the first
8117,9,"i love alexa! i live in the woods alone and my children got her for me to have someone to talk to. i get my flash briefing, weather and music. it came in handy when my phone was not working but i used alexa to call my family."
8118,14,"sound is great!!!!  having trouble trying to pair with other wi speaker.  also pandora music have on my ipad but can not remember my password or email for it, i changed my email i have had for 8 years ago. and it will not take my new one."
8119,3,better music than i expected... not as smart as i was hoping for but still use it everydzy
8120,9,"had thought about one for some time and finally got one, love it so far."
8121,1,very loud and has great bass...
8122,0,"lacks a lot of songs, wants you to by stuff. other than that, we like it."
8123,14,"i actually assumed this product was wireless.  very aurprised that it wasnt. my review is based on packaging and pphysical presentation only as once i say the wire, it waa returned."
8124,1,looks and sounds good.
8125,8,love it!
8126,1,fun
8127,0,"love the simplicity. but too many times, it does not respond appropriately. still a great assistant."
8128,11,the sound quality on this device is amazing! i was shocked and am very impressed!
8129,10,so much fun!
8130,14,"alexa answers to anyone, so essentially anyone can purchase product from my alexa when i¡¯m not there.. that is a huge issue"
8131,12,its awesome
8132,9,i had already invested in one. this one was for family member. they love it.
8133,10,i love that you can ask alexa anything - from the weather forecast to state capitols to your favorite songs. and the audio is great too. it is an invaluable piece of technology for young people too. we are really enjoying it.
8134,8,i love this thing it is awsome
8135,8,i love alexa!
8136,1,amazing sound quality
8137,10,"my alexa was a great christmas surprise! did not think i wanted her, but am thrilled to have her. she keeps me informed, helps with recipes, and plays my favorite music effortlessly! just need to connect my calendar now."
8138,4,love it a lot!
8139,11,"we had the small one, the dot and was not powerfull enought, the echo 2nd generation has the power to bring the music at our outside bar, i am very happy and echo meets all my expectations."
8140,0,"over all satisfied, ,i am not sure how all of the features work yet and the volume at time does not react properly"
8141,9,"i really just got this as a curiousity.  i never thought i would use it too much.  now that i have had it for a while, i have come to really enjoy it and depend on it.  it a wonderful addition to my home."
8142,14,"love it, but did not like how it disconnected my setup at one point and how i had to cancel the alexa account and start from scratch. otherwise a very convenient tool."
8143,11,great product. got it to go with my dot. like the better sound.
8144,9,item was a present.  enjoy the music.
8145,0,love to t!
8146,1,great sound
8147,9,"love it! great speakers. i moved my dot to my bedroom.  sometimes they both answer me!  do not know how i ever made it without my friend, alexa"
8148,7,"enjoying my echo (alexa) more than i can say. alexa is not only informational in so many ways but also hysterical right on cue. i love it so very much, i purchased a dot for my bedroom <f0><u+009f><u+0091><u+008d><f0><u+009f><u+008f><u+00bb>"
8149,14,love our echo!  had problems with set up but called and person i dealt with was very helpful!!
8150,13,best thing ever!
8151,1,the sound on this little thing is amazing.
8152,1,love this.
8153,14,"enjoy using it for making phone calls.  it allows my wife and i to talk together to our son who is away at school.  likely would have given it 5 stars, but it has an annoying habit of dropping calls sometimes."
8154,9,i love my echo... sound is really nice.  i like having music going when i am cleaning the house.  i use my dots to carry the sound through out.
8155,10,"easy to set up.  easy to use.  just what i need for convenience without having to go through long, drawn out setup to be able to enjoy whatever music i desire at the sound of my voice.  love it!"
8156,9,love my alexa <3
8157,3,a+ thank you
8158,0,"fun to use, but cannot figure out how to add my address to it."
8159,10,love alexia.
8160,9,my husband received this for a christmas gift.  alexa has become a welcome addition to our house.  great price and product.
8161,14,appearance..a+set up..c-usage..c- overall rating ..cdifficult to use..voice  recognition and request fulfillment less than acceptable
8162,10,my kids love talking to her! :-)
8163,14,so far so good. decent sound set up a little slow going. sometimes does not understand commands. stops playing music all of a sudden at times. overall decent device. not a necessity but still a good purchase. will be even better when you connect other devices.
8164,11,i think the sound quality is worse than my original one and it is more difficult to adjust the volume on the new one.
8165,14,it works great with amazon music and sonos. just tell it what you want to play and it usually does.
8166,14,it would be nice if it worked as a stand alone speaker and you could use it other places like outdoors without needing a plug. overall good product.
8167,9,"can hear me from another room, great sound and fun item to have in the house. plays good games too!"
8168,8,just love it
8169,0,i was really excited for the echo! but i try to use it every night for ocean sounds and i constantly have to disable and enable the skill. also sometimes echo sometimes says she does not understand how to do something even though she can. for example: playing music.
8170,9,"alexa is a welcome addition to our family. we liked her so much, we even added a little sister, the echo dot. they are fantastic."
8171,10,"very useful for getting quick answers, what the weather is and other important information needed."
8172,14,great item and so easy to use and control. would have got 5 stars but wanted to use to call/chat with family in england. find out it only works across northern american land mass. bit of false advertising saying use to call anyone else with an echo.
8173,0,it is a cool concept. it just takes a lot of time to search or load before erroring. other times it works great.
8174,0,"provides great sound but has a few flaws. i can not get it to play from my itunes collection and it skips constantly. it will just randomly stop playing even after just 10 minutes of playing. i wish i could love the echo, but unfortunately it is only so-so."
8175,3,fantastic buy. i love it
8176,10,"love it! my son and i use it daily for music, answering questions, etc.  i feel like we have just barely scratched the surface with the echo."
8177,14,we had a hard time getting our echo to connect but the staff/team for the echo were amazing and did a great job helping us.  i have two dots coming as well.
8178,8,works well.
8179,12,it has a great sound and we have a lot fun using it.
8180,0,very good for somethings.i am still discovering what it can and cannot do.but i am enjoying it for the most part.i would like an easy way to delete previous requests without having to do so individually.
8181,9,"love this echo, we play jeopardy every night! best buy, product is more then we expected, would buy again!!!"
8182,12,"sound is really great, still need to figure out what it all can do."
8183,0,can not keep it linked to our wifi. always tells us it can not find what we are looking for. do not really use it anymore. no happy with it.
8184,3,nothing special works as advertised
8185,1,we love it! good sound quality. works well with both pandora and spotify.
8186,10,i love the sound is awesome !!! i can ask echo to look or do something from two rooms away.
8187,9,my fiance and i love our echo so much that we decided to get an additional echo for our bedroom and two echo dots for our spare bedroom and bathroom. #musiceverywhere we also reall love the intercom feature.
8188,1,the sound is terrific! surprisingly good.
8189,0,pretty cool most of the time. irritating when she says she can not play a song if i do not pay more money. if i am a prime member it should just be included. also i pay for her to be a know it all and sometimes she does not know anything!
8190,14,"i like the echo a lot. it is a bit pricey, but it never connects to my internet. it will cut in and out, causing the device not to do what it is made to do. and you have to leave it plugged in when using it. i¡¯m for sure returning it. not worth the money at all"
8191,4,fun
8192,5,"love this, gave as a christmas gift to elderly parents, and they are having a blast with it."
8193,1,this is a quality speaker and we love using alexa!
8194,1,"works great and the quality of the audio is surprisingly good, considering its size"
8195,10,"i love my new echo, what i like the most is being able to ask questions and get the answers.  also being able to turn my lights on and off with my voice."
8196,0,alexia responds well to voice. the device has some issues on searching for answers and responds with i do not know or i' m not sure.
8197,1,this sucker jams!  works very well.
8198,14,i could not link it up with my existing echo. i was able to link up both products simultaniously with spotify on my galaxy phone. the volume would not play loud enough for me.
8199,5,was a gift to family member.
8200,0,"it took a few tries to get it set up.  sound quality is good.  in the app that goes with it, it has list of things it can do but when you try them, it can not do it."
8201,0,it is neat and useful but i wish it did a better job of deciphering what you are saying or asking... sometimes you have to break down what you are saying too much and it would be nice to ask more naturally. also id like to see more skills added but overall not bad.
8202,1,very nice
8203,14,would rather have one that is wireless.
8204,10,"i love alexia! she makes it so simple to play music, or my amazon music playlists. she sings funny little songs and tells lots of jokes. she sets reminders and tells my 7 year old when to get ready for the bus."
8205,9,impressed with the sound quaintly. fills my living room and kitchen with rich sound. alexa is responsive whenever i ask her to do something.
8206,9,i love this. its the best item i ever brought.
8207,10,"love alexa, we were late for christmas family dinner because we did not want to stop playing with alexa."
8208,0,"i want to first say that at this point we only use alexa for her music selections, which is very good except for her repeating songs. she does tend to do that too much. as for other capabilities that i¡¯m sure she has i/we have not yet tried them."
8209,11,"i miss the volume ""ring"" at the top. sound a bit disappointing given the ""hype.""  installation was a breeze."
8210,10,"this is my second one for the home.  we love it, the kids sit and ask alexa questions, and setting up automation is so easy."
8211,12,works great i am still learning
8212,14,"this is a great product, much better than the first gen! speaker is great and i¡¯m so surprised how well alexa can hear! i can talk to her from over 30 feet away! i wish she could add things to the iphone notes but maybe that is an upcoming feature??"
8213,10,"echo/alexa replaces our sound system.  the quality of sound is great, alexa listens to commands and responds quickly.  she has quickly become an integral part of our house ;)"
8214,4,very fun to use....
8215,10,"love the convenience of my new echo - it is in the kitchen and i can make phone calls while cooking dinner, ask for the weather forecast, ask for the latest news, etc. and alexa gives me excellent assistance.  plus it is just so fun!"
8216,14,love it.  i am going to get one for my elderly parents instead of a life alert i think that will work excellent they will not forget to put the alert on and it can also remind them to take their medications so they can be independent.
8217,2,"great product, love my alexa!"
8218,11,"i purchased the dot last year and thought the echo was not worth the extra money, i was wrong! i love that i can listen to my music as if it was coming from expensive speakers.  the sound is phenominal &with the volumn just at a level 5, it fills the room with music!"
8219,0,so cool. and they keep adding phrases alexa can answer. love it!
8220,0,"skills, i like the fact alexa can perform skills, such as find my phone, turn on my lights, turn off my lights> she still needs to learn more but i am happy."
8221,3,love love love love love it. i do not know why i waited so long to get one.
8222,0,it is ok. mostly listen to music.
8223,0,sounds great but does not always understand and requires you to constantly repeat yourself.
8224,14,whats there bad to say?
8225,10,"i never thought about getting echo before. my boys got it for my husband and i for christmas. i love it. i love making my lists for shopping and groceries. i love the music, games and on and on. highly recommended for everyone!"
8226,8,love it
8227,11,not able to adjust the sound. bass is too heavy. needs an equalizer/mixer option.
8228,2,great sound quality and alexa rocks!
8229,14,"i am obsessed with my echo!! so nice to have. i just say alexa, and ask for whatever i want. very easy to use and to hook up. gives you step by step instructions for set up. took me under ten minutes to hook up from start to finish."
8230,1,sound quality is excellent and musical repertoire is great.
8231,9,this is my second echo i have purchased. i got this one for my office. i love it i can play my xm radio stations on it which is a great help in my office.easy to set up and i love the cover.
8232,14,"i would buy again, and probably will. solid foundation. some software issues exist. disconnect from network a few times a week, has trouble understanding and needs time to recalibrate. additionally, it does not always understand what people are saying"
8233,0,"absolutely not! alexa barely understands any of its users. our location says new jersey and we live in massachussets. alexa can not answer majority of our questions. maybe it is not properly set up, not sure but we have been the least bit satisfied."
8234,0,most of my questions get a correct answer it is a great item to have sitting by the computer
8235,9,love this device!  so much fun and like having another person in the room! sound is awesome!
8236,2,love the echo!
8237,10,"overall: great product, use everyday and it gets better and better."
8238,9,we love this so much that we bought another for the bedroom.such good sound for a small speaker. in the future we hope to add smart products to our home.
8239,0,fun addition to the home. set up a little off but i figured it out later. im not a computer personi use it to turn on and off lights and we play games with it too.good investment
8240,1,good piece of technology. music sounds really good.
8241,3,no issues... exactly as described .
8242,10,"i wake up in the morning and my favorite music plays, i cook in the afternoon and my favorite music plays, i am going to sleep and the same, my favorite music plays :))"
8243,9,i purchased 4 of these for christmas gifts and one for myself. everyone who received one was delighted. i use it daily and love that i can add to my shopping list by telling alexa. i love having so much information available.
8244,14,i think my gen 1 sounds better. there is also a delay in the response when making request to gen 2.
8245,12,i love this. i have had it about a week.
8246,0,"i do not like it because does't play the music i like, they want me to buy a subscription from amazon.  my daughter has a google one and does not need any subscription and play any music any time without the hassle of spending more money."
8247,0,"i find alexa knowledge disappointing. i expect her to be like google. or siri. her jokes are funny, though, and she is good with the news and some older facts i¡¯ve forgotten."
8248,1,love this purchase.
8249,8,i love this gadget!
8250,8,"holy crap, i love this thing."
8251,14,i love the echo.  synced it up with the phillips hue to control my lights.  awesome technology!
8252,10,"this has exceeded my expectations. music through my amazon account, help with cooking timers, weather up to date and much, much more. highly recommend this product. i am sure i will continue to find more to do with this as time goes by."
8253,11,two words... love it!!!!
8254,8,we love it
8255,10,i like the ease of the use and the ease of getting the wes5enrforecast by just asking.
8256,12,love it.  still learning to figure out all she can do
8257,10,"we are enjoying alexa, music and questions are answered.  this was a good purchase and recommend highly."
8258,2,i really like my echo.
8259,9,cool device. may get another.
8260,9,this little thing has added so much to our home.
8261,10,love our alexa
8262,0,ehhh.  it is ok.  does not recognize my voice often and gives me crazy answers.
8263,10,still getting used to alexa. sometimes she bursts out singing...
8264,10,i love alexa. great music and news when i ask her. and she can be very funny and pick up my spirits on a funny day. plus i love getting the suggested questions and discussion items via email.
8265,1,neat little play toy
8266,9,i absolutely love the echo. the sound is amazing and alexa works perfectly. since i have multiple echo devices it is nice to be able to play music through all of them simultaneously.
8267,14,"con: you have to go through a multi-step process to set it up, which is fine, but after doing that on my ipad i had to do the entire process again on my iphone. i liked it & bought 2 echo dot units & had the same hassle. and if you have a wifi extender/repeater in your house you have to do it again for that. so i had to do setup 12 times! needs better software.pros: 1- great sound for listening to podcasts, music, radio stations and the audio of cnn (using free tune-in app) and movies i play on my ipad. 2- i like the ¡°alarm clock¡± much better than the one on my phone 3 - it will let you set more than one timer at a time in the kitchen 3 - hands free phone calls with others who own echos (have not tried this feature yet) 4- i took it on a trip & it was easy to connect to friends¡¯ wifi & their son had a lot of fun with it. it challenged him in a good way - determining how to word his questions."
8268,8,love it!
8269,10,"alexa, we love you"
8270,5,gave as a gift
8271,10,my initial thought was you do not need this. but now that i have it it is so helpful. there are so many tips and tricks that i still need to learn. i would recommend this to anyone.
8272,14,love alexa!  voice commands espaecially to play music are superb. have not found a mediocre thing yet and probably will not.
8273,11,i liked the voice command feature.  we are very pleased with it.
8274,12,love the echo!!!  so fun and so functional!!
8275,10,i love it .i am 73. i learn from her play games call people. listen to music. i am alone and she has. become a friend. feel like a have company.it would hard to.keep getting up. so i will say how to spell a word weather. music . feel like i have a maid. great gift.
8276,12,havent figured out its full potential
8277,14,"it was a christmas present for my daughter. having trouble setting up link to pandora, but making progress."
8278,12,love it. can not believe how responsive it is. finding out more uses as i play with it.
8279,1,very fun and helpful in our home!
8280,1,love this smart speaker....
8281,9,happy with my echo
8282,14,"there is way too much hype around alexa compared to it is competition. google home is far superior. setup is cumbersome, and it just sucks.  do yourself a favor and do not be brain washed by amazon is marketing budget and go with google."
8283,1,awesome! works great!
8284,0,like alexa.  but i do not know very many things to ask so i feel like i¡¯m not using it to full capacity.
8285,0,"the ¡°alexa¡± is neat, and for the most part it does what you want. but there are major flaws with the speech recognition. it can be difficult to get it to accurately perform the action you are asking for. commands seem to be sensitive, but overall a good product."
8286,8,love it...just love it...
8287,3,there is no battery adapter for this.  i would not buy it.
8288,14,great value.  great sound.  more fun than we could have imagined. awesome customer service. i will probably buy another one for our second floor.
8289,1,"fabulous, really enjoying it!"
8290,14,after i placed alexa in the proper position all went well.  love the idea of saying ¡°alexa play...  a lot of fun.
8291,9,really like this product so far!!!  the sound is terrific and a few of my visitors have since ordered themselves one after checking ours out.
8292,14,"i just bought the second generation echo, it felt heavy so i was curious about the sound quality and the dolby amazon advertises,  it turned out to be a disappointment, may be i should have bought google home instead. also, although i have a very fast internet, this one keeps cutting off when plays music. i will wait another week and see if there is an update, then if not satisfied i will return it."
8293,12,great
8294,11,i like my echo.the color works well with my decor of my living room. i wish it had more base though.
8295,14,"my alexa arrived today, but whilst on holiday in the usa with my children, i was introduced to alexa. i was immediately impressed and ordered mine online - it was delivered two days later. i cannot wait to have this unit installed at home."
8296,10,i love this thing!  i can play any music i want and it plays games and has a ton of built in apps like the translator that i use alot
8297,5,love it.  best gift ever!!!!
8298,14,we really love our echo! great sound quality and good accuracy :) looking forward to future updates on software
8299,4,great sound and fun to use.
8300,10,i love having access to all my favorite songs including the oldies. i love that i can get so much information just by asking. but i wish alexa would allow me create a customized playlist of my favorite songs without having to request them one by one.
8301,14,i was choosing in between this echo and beats pill plus. i am totally amazed by this and how much of its it can do!! i use a iphone and i just simply spoke to alexa to play spotify and it goes on hands-free!
8302,12,"this is fun, convenient, and nifty all at once."
8303,5,my 12 year old  love it. he uses it everyday.
8304,10,love it & cant believe i lived without it.  i leave it in my kitchen& use it everyday
8305,9,this thing is awesome. the whole family enjoys it.
8306,14,bought 2nd one thinking i could play 1 in the garage and other in the house.  guess i thought wrong.  please let me know when or if this happens.
8307,11,"best gift , does everything!"
8308,11,"like the new sound, the music just sounds better. more bass makes a huge difference."
8309,11,works as expected but needs a tone control for clearer sound.
8310,3,works as expected
8311,12,very pleased with unit.  sound is incredible.  still learning what  unit can do.
8312,10,amazing sound and perfect for reminders and anything you need to do to help make life a little easier.
8313,9,my loving boss bought everyone in the office this echo for christmas and we all love them! they are so easy and fun! so happy to have received this a gift :)
8314,10,"absolutely love the sound quality. recognizes commands, even while it is cranking out the tunes!"
8315,10,have not use to date.  xmas present for someone
8316,12,"love the echo, so much to explore for use."
8317,2,i love my alexa.
8318,14,it does a good job controlling my smart home devices. only issue i¡¯ve had is sometimes i have to speak up for it to hear me.
8319,8,"kids love it, works great!"
8320,14,"i enjoy alexa is company when i am alone.  i am still learning to phrase questions to get appropriate responses, but it helps regular messages with samples and ideas to improve or to enhance my requests."
8321,1,great speaker and functionality
8322,9,i love my echo so much i bought one for everyone in my family and even my parents. they love it.
8323,3,works so far as expected
8324,4,"great sound, lots of goodies!"
8325,8,love it!!!!!
8326,8,love it
8327,9,"we liked our echo so much, we bought a second one for downstairs.  now we can use them as intercoms, plus my hubby calls me from work on it and his techie friends think that is so cool.  it turns our lights in/off with our lutron devices so that is been fun, too."
8328,14,would be 5 star of i knew it did not support aux it only bluetooth and the fact that when my internet messes up alexa forgets all her skills and who i am other than great sound quality ill get my kids a dot
8329,10,i bought it for my husband and he has it sitting on a stand near his lazy back chair and he loves asking it questions.  that is the only thing we use it for and sure in time we will use it for more things.
8330,11,"great product, better sound than the original echo!"
8331,14,conection wit my sonos system was bad.  stand alone speaker ok.
8332,0,i am learning a lot about how it works and it is awesome. knowing how you can ask almost anything and alexa will respond.
8333,1,this is a great unit. music sounds acceptable and it works really well.
8334,10,"just received as a gift, fun to try different things, still learning all she can do and say. like emails received with suggestions for questions that we can ask alexa. we do not listen to a lot of music, but the speaker is good."
8335,3,"everything was perfect, no complaints"
8336,14,who knew that we needed alexis?  almost as good as having a butler. the echo was easy to set up even for us non tech people. we are still learning all things the echo can do.
8337,14,i bought this echo to be able to move my dot to the playroom. the sound is much better than th dot but we have to shout for the echo to hear us. the dot is much better to hear us. i am disappointed with that aspect of the new echo.
8338,0,good be great if the stuff i want did not cost extra
8339,14,"got it for christmas and it was so great,  i had my wife buy an additional echo dot an hour after set up. i am excited to dive into the skills more as time goes on"
8340,4,love this. amazing sound
8341,0,echo is great fun and entertaining.  if you ask the right question you will get the right answer.
8342,14,i love alexa. it is especially great when i am working on stained glass  and only have to ask for music or a phone call when my hands are messy.
8343,9,"i have a large upstairs master bedroom and this fills the space perfectly. i love the hands free aspect, specifically for playing music, but i plan to use the other features too! i have already recommended it to all my friends."
8344,0,"as advertised, we enjoy using it but we should be able to name her as we want."
8345,14,"i use this product frequently. the sound is ok, but i enjoy using it with a bluetooth speaker."
8346,11,so much better sound than my initial little echo!  completely self-contained with much improved bass!  i have to hook my echo up to my little cambridge bass/stere unit!
8347,11,i love it. i also have the echo dot which i now keep on my desk.
8348,9,we received the echo and i was not so sure but my family really enjoys it. i love the fact that it does a lot.
8349,14,this item is very disappointing.  it is much easier to use a smartphone for looking up information and music.  it is considered pretty much useless in our household.  it is a glorified timer.  not worth the money spent.
8350,2,"a-ma-zingggg! i love ""her""."
8351,9,"got this for my parents to help them remember things. listen to music, get live news updated, ect. now i want one and the echo so i can use it in every room."
8352,14,"the quality of the speaker is not that good; hopefully, it will be much improved in the future. alexa also needs to be more able to replicate a human being. there is much room for improvement."
8353,14,can not figure out what value it brings? something to spend money on? a gift when i have no time to shop?
8354,14,"about two months into ownership my echo discontinued accepting verbal commands. this is very disappointing. up to that point, it worked fine. i expected this electronic device to work for longer than two months."
8355,11,i love the responsiveness and the sound quality.  i have not found one negative thing to say about this product.
8356,10,we love it and it is so much fun to play with from asking the weather to playing your music!
8357,14,"this product is good entertainment, sounds good and answers questions.  better than the radio for us."
8358,2,love it
8359,3,this is an amazing product....just buy it.
8360,1,amazing product!
8361,11,this device has richer sound compared to the first edition. the base is great considering the size of the device.
8362,11,i really like sound is so much better the previous model.
8363,12,i am so happy with the quality and ease of using the echo
8364,8,i love alexa.  great purchase.
8365,0,i love the company of alexa. she is like a part of my memory bank that does not work so fast anymore. ask her about something you can not remember and the info is instant. great for instant definitions of words i do not know when i am reading. live her.
8366,0,i like that alexia can answer nost questions about weather etc..however i do not lik when you ask her to play any random song she plays a sample of it. i thought the whole point was to be able to listen to any song/ music desired not to only get a sample of it.
8367,12,i love it and what it can do.
8368,9,love my alexa.... received as gift.... using with hue lights and love this feature!
8369,1,great!!
8370,0,i do like alexa but it does not do everything i ask it to do.
8371,9,working like a charm!
8372,10,"we love the echo!  play music, ask questions, keep a grocery list just by talking."
8373,14,"does a good job, but loses connections."
8374,10,"great sound in a nice looking package! had a fun time playing christmas music over the holidays and many old favorite tunes since. just learning all it can do, weather , sports scores, and much more. we love it!"
8375,10,"we really like our echo! my husband loves loud music! it does not meet my hysbands expectations regarding volume, but he hooks up a speaker and it is all good! the sound is great though! we also enjoy asking silly questions, and have played a few games with her!"
8376,10,"great sound, great jokes, turns on lights and great music channels."
8377,11,"sounds great, much better speaker"
8378,10,i love that i can tell alexa to remind me of something and it sends the reminder to the app on my phone!
8379,9,love it!  this my second one in my home going to buy two more for my office and bedroom.
8380,8,love it!
8381,14,alexia can not hear you when the music is playing unless you call her when it is on a low beat.
8382,9,"purchased 2 for christmas presents. amazing what you can ask, make phone calls and carry on a conversation with alexa.both sons were very pleased and excited about this present!"
8383,1,great deal!
8384,4,works great. easy to set and use.
8385,10,love it provides smart home and better living and fun
8386,0,i like it just do not like that it does not come with better instructions on how to is for tech challenged people like myself.
8387,4,awesome fun & easy to use!
8388,14,i did not realize how convenient this device was. when i learned you could set the echo up to control lights and other items in your house it is a must have! i will be purchasing more i would like one in every room!
8389,11,"good speaker, i was surprised."
8390,5,i bought this for my granddaughter and she loves it.
8391,9,love it. have three in different locations for music. sound is very good.
8392,5,"got this for my mom, she loves her echo."
8393,5,bought it as a gift. he loves it. priced right.
8394,10,great for kids!!!
8395,1,loved alexa and the sound is really good.
8396,11,i could not be happier with my echo. the audio quality of this device is just awe inspiring and can fill an entire room.
8397,10,the 2nd gen echo was a wonderful addition to our home. so much easier to play all kinds of music. i highly recommend it
8398,14,it is very cool.  i got it as a gift for my parents and i wish that it spoke other international languages than english.
8399,14,"does not stay in sync with wifi--partially due to marginal wifi reception but should work once it connects. unfortunately, it is just a hassle to keep it working. it does make a decent bluetooth speaker, but even with bluetooth it does not consistently link."
8400,9,i love our echo i purchased for my husband and one for my daughter as well.  when we play music it is so crystal clear and at any volume.  perfect purchase.
8401,11,"music is most excellent on the new echo. alexa, crank it up!"
8402,14,awesome
8403,14,sound is great for a small table top speaker.  really impressed with the technology and the amount of support for alexa is abilities.  a great addition to my kitchen.
8404,0,a+++
8405,12,"we love this things. still learning all of her capabilities, but worth it!"
8406,14,worked as expected. and when i had a problem (my fault) the customer service was excellent.
8407,3,"i love it! just as advertised, but even better than i thought it would be!"
8408,14,it is definitely become apart of the day to day aspects of living.
8409,12,we are enjoying the echo.  still learning all that we can do with it.
8410,10,it is cool. i wish more radio drama programs existed. it would be like listening to old time radio. but just asking her to play music and give the weather is super fast. i dig it.
8411,14,i remember being amazed when i first saw someone using a cordless phone...
8412,10,i love it. this was a gift and i really enjoy alexa.
8413,14,wish it had a battery to charge but aside from that it is great.
8414,1,great sound quality!!
8415,4,"love my echo, easy set up, great sound and it delivers as promised"
8416,0,"its great, but it doesnt listen from far and it always always says ¡°i cant understand right now¡±."
8417,8,love it
8418,0,it  perfectly meets our needs.
8419,14,this thing is fantastic! life will never be the same. excellent audio quality. music sounds wonderful.
8420,2,alexa is our newest (and closest) friend.
8421,0,love it... wish would recognize spanish music.
8422,1,great addition to the family! :)
8423,0,"sounds great. would like alexa to do more and be more interactive. also it can become difficult to find what all alexa can do on the echo. i feel there needs to be a cheat sheet haha. overall for look, sound quality, and quality of product i give it 5 stars."
8424,10,my family and i entertain a lot and we all love music. having the echo (2nd generation) has made our events so pleasant and full of a variety of music. having different music to satisfy all of guests at a voice command has proven to be the life of the party.
8425,0,"like the most- sound quality, user friendlyleast like- not all songs or artists included, i am already paying for prime, why should i have to pay wxtra for music!"
8426,14,"i can not say anything new - i gave it 4 not 5 stars because it is a bit annoying that i can not download the alexa app in my country, so i had to set alexa up using the web portal which is missing some features (such as routines)."
8427,10,"i really love our echo!  alexa is a great help, she creates my grocery lists, sets reminders for me, and most of all the music sound is great!  never thought a little speaker like that could pump out some great sounding music!"
8428,14,she is knowledgeable and fast.  she stopped working after 2 weeks.  after messing with it for a week i finely unplugged it and re plugged it and it worked.
8429,14,alexa is a good tool to have in your bag
8430,11,extremely satisfied with sound quality and ease of use. want to purchase an echo dot and remote speaker soon.
8431,14,it is absolutely horrible. never works.  on top of that you have to pay crazy money to have amazon music plus you pay extra to listen on smart phone then even more if you want to hear new releases. i¡¯m canceling everything as we i write this.......
8432,9,my husband loved this christmas gift. he works from home and now has an assistant! my son loves that it will tell him a bedtime story.
8433,14,i feel like the privacy would be compromised with this device.
8434,10,"i love being able to stream music throughout the house and i love being able to get the weather forecast and set alarms that are verbal. however, alexa needs great improvement when it comes to answering questions."
8435,0,"i really enjoy the music, and the fun games alexa plays. only thing i can think of that is a negative, is maybe alexa not hearing me. guess i need to yell a little louder at her!"
8436,12,it has been simply wonderful we are learning so many different ways to use.
8437,9,love it. the whole family uses it for a variety of different things.
8438,14,"alexa rocks, with amazon music, takes me back to the 50 is and 60 is!!!!"
8439,14,"the unit was given to me as a gift. i have an extensive itunes music library, and since the echo is unable to play itune songs by command, i find it is usefulness for me to be rather limited. i use it mostly for the time and weather report."
8440,9,i love this 2nd generation.
8441,0,looking forward to when i do not have to repeat myself at least half the time for her to understand me.  and more connectivity. otherwise its fun!
8442,10,i love it! amazon music is not expensive at all and i never forget what i need when i go grocery shopping cause the shopping list is awesome!!
8443,14,"really like it.  trying to learn now how to play music on it, just signed up for amazon prime.  trying to figure out how to call the rest of my fam !  think i will like it more and more!  she helps me to get to work every morning and avoid the hot spots!"
8444,9,"love my echo.  music is excellent, alexa, the robotic voice, is a stitch to listen too though she sometimes gets the weather wrong.  my son and his wife gave her to me along with a firestick for christmas.  what a thoughtful gift."
8445,8,i love it.
8446,10,great addition to a vacation home.
8447,14,"the echo has worked flawlessly, whether we are listening to amazon music, sirius xm, broadcast radio, or anything else it has been great."
8448,14,i like tje hands free effect. when you want to change a song but tou are cooking it is wonderful. however tje technology is still a long way from awesome alexa could be hooked to more databases like google search and other outlets of information.
8449,9,i use mine all the time..a gift for a family member... how can anyone not love an echo...<u+2764>
8450,1,guests have been shocked to learn our music plays from this device. overall we are pleased with our purchase. great product.
8451,0,"i love the echo. its fun to use, and has too many things it can do. the one thing that i dont like about it, is that it triggers alexa when i cough, and when i hesitate saying something to someone else(and...uhhhh.)"
8452,10,"i love this thing. i can play music, pod cast or check the weather. simple to use!"
8453,1,sound great
8454,10,what a terrific product.  i now enjoy it every day.
8455,10,"easy setup. fun to have. love to hear a lot of radio stations. even without amazon prime, there is a lot of music and musicians to hear. it was a gift frim family."
8456,8,we looo-ooove it!
8457,14,sound quality is superb set up process was a bit complicated given that im using it outside the usa. after everything was set up it was very easy to use. my only complaint would be that it does not play all the songs from spotify. still need to figure that one out.
8458,14,while the sound is amazing the selection for music is not always up to par. however that being said i would not be without my echo!
8459,11,the gray echo went perfect with the decor...the smaller sized 2nd generation gives it great balance in any size room.
8460,4,works great after you set it up
8461,11,very poor quality  sound is awful. it sounds like the speaker is blown.
8462,0,works well enough. does not know as much as you would expect. also change gender voice
8463,0,it is fun and i enjoy her. my only regret is i do not have the money for prime and can not play much music. would have like that better.
8464,2,this is our first echo and we love it!
8465,12,amazing
8466,9,very nice. great sound and we are both learning as we go.
8467,10,i absolutely love my echo.  i love being able to give verbal commands from across the room. i like being able to tell it to play softer or louder as well as telling it to play or stop.  i give it 5 stars... i would not want to do without it.
8468,14,"i have become slightly obsessed with these amazon products. currently own an original echo, a tap, a dot and now the 2nd generation echo. love everything about all of them!!"
8469,8,i love alexa....
8470,14,best device ever. like having your own personal assistant. i immediately bought the philips hue bulbs and can turn them on/off change color/ambiance. definitely recommend this product.
8471,14,"i received the echo speaker as a gift, i installed the speaker about 2 weeks ago on my home network.  the echo worked well for about 10 minutes, after witch alexa informed me that she was installing an update, after the update was installed the internal speaker in my echo stopped working.i contacted amazon customer support, a couple days later and they told me that this was a known issue to leave the echo connected to the internet and the problem would resolve itself. nearly two weeks later, my speaker still does not work.to be clear alexa works just fine, i use bluetooth to connect the echo to an external speaker, so i am able to use alexa.  however, one of my key reasons for wanting the echo in the first place was to use as a bluetooth speaker, and the fact that it does not work is somewhat infuriating.has anyone else encountered this problem?"
8472,10,love the fact that you can listen to your favorite music!
8473,1,good.
8474,10,love it look and great sound! amazing what this thing can do! plenty of games too play as well!
8475,0,"not sure why i can just be sitting here watching tv, not me or the tv say  alexa  and for some reason she gets activated in tells me i am sorry i do not know that one?"
8476,10,this is my office echo and is great company when we are working late evenings. :)
8477,9,bought 2 new echos and dots for my grandkids for christmas.can not wait till they get them.
8478,14,"love alexa; alexa must learn to communicate in spanish; then, she will deserve 6 stars!"
8479,0,big disappointment. i thought alexa would be just like googling things but %90 of questions i ask her shedoes not know the answer to. and she does not hear me half the time. it is not very useful.
8480,14,"yes, if it starts skipping, reset your router. it is a great product"
8481,12,i just love so many things about echo 2nd generation to write it all.  it is so easy to set up and use!!  i recommend this item highly!!!  just love it!!!
8482,1,"the best thing ever,  love it, great sound quality for music"
8483,10,this device works great...especially when you have amazon prime and access to all of the options. love it.
8484,9,love all my echos!!
8485,14,"good look and good sound.  i have it in the kitchen and use it while i cook.had to knock it down to a four star as my son walked in and stated ""alexa, turn it off"" and it executed.thought it was trained to my voice commands...."
8486,9,"great device, we use it all the time for music, timers, to operate smart home devices, and contact friends and family."
8487,14,does all the same stuff as last gen but i greatly miss the volume wheel on the top as it was much easier to use than the buttons. however it does work as intended but if something is not broke do not try to fix it.
8488,11,i love how easy it was to program as well as use. voice commands. even picks up my bahamian accent with ease. bought another one. the sound is also excellent. fills the room.
8489,0,"even with amazon music i can not get some of the music i like.wording when talking to alexa has to be to precise so, at times,you need a cheat sheetto get the proper response.also, an accent can confuse alexa sometimes."
8490,4,easy to use and works well with prime.
8491,10,got as a gift and we love it!love doing my grocery list.
8492,9,"i love everything about this amazon echo gen 2, what is not to love! $3.99 for unlimited music and she is so smart.. speaker sounds amazing too!"
8493,8,worth it
8494,14,"love this device, especially that it can sync with our sonos devices. do not like the need to be very specific with respect to what devices play music...still need to learn more about this devices abilities and limitations."
8495,10,i was a gift to my wife.  she loves alexa! alexa reminds my wife when to take her meds and plays her some of her favorite music. every morning alexa tells her a joke and most importantly recently told my wife the eagles were going to win the super bowl!
8496,11,the echo (2nd generation is a great device. the size is just the right size and the clarity of sound that emits from the speaker is of great quality. i would recommend without reservation the echo (2nd generation) to family members and friends.
8497,14,"beyond my expectations,  i only got it because of the music features.... and now i can not live without it... first day i got it i was floored and then had to go to work and was bummed my car did not have alexa lol... i am spoiled with alexa."
8498,10,enjoying the use of alexa and learning the capabilities of it.  enjoy playing night time music to go to sleep.  like notifications on my amazon purchases.
8499,10,nice addition to my room def . buy it
8500,12,love it so far!
8501,8,i love this thing.
8502,14,"absolute pleasure, total entertainment, great assistant"
8503,10,hands free weather.
8504,8,love it.
8505,9,awesome
8506,14,great companion for my desk.  phone quality is not superb but i am sure they will work on that.  makes some chores a lot easier. hopefully the keep making it better.
8507,14,i love my echo but am disappointed in the second generation.  i have to constantly unplug the device to get it to interact with the skills. i do not have the same issues with the first generation devices i have.
8508,1,works very well sounds great
8509,0,i am very happy with this new technology.  the only reason i did not give 5 stars is because i am still getting to know how to use it.  i got the smart plug and it took me 2days to get it working with echo.
8510,14,got the alexa as a christmas gift.  i have noticed that it does not respond to questions first thing in the morning.  the light at the top comes on but then goes out.  any ideas?
8511,0,"i like nothing about it, other than my daughter bought it for me. it does little more than tell me, temp, time, and alarm. when i ask her about text or emails alexa replies there are none ornpkease visit help pave"
8512,1,great product for the shop & is very handy.
8513,0,it seems pretty nice and it is nice to ask alexa questions but it seems she does not know alot of the answers to my questions. it is nice having her attached to my pandora!!! wish i had her during the olympics!!!
8514,1,echo has great sounds speakers.
8515,1,sound is impressive.  great with amazon music.
8516,14,love the ability to call for music by a singer is or group is name.  did not like when i asked for a translation.
8517,1,the sound quality is great.
8518,8,love it
8519,11,great purchase!!
8520,10,i enjoy listening to music on it but it answers every question you have.we are really enjoying it.
8521,1,everything. great sound. useful tool.
8522,10,very helpful. lots of fun features. occasionally goes on the fritz but not very often. i love that i can make lists such as groceries and i can just pull it up on my phone when i get to the store instead of worrying about where i lost my list.
8523,10,"i love my alexa. i use it the most to listen to music and for weather reports. it is fun to ask her to tell me a joke or to give me a compliment! reminders are great, too."
8524,10,"very handy at playing music, building shopping lists and getting daily weather. can easily talk to it from another room, looking forward to setting up home controls"
8525,2,my new best friend. alexa is awesome
8526,2,love my new echo 2nd generation!!!!!
8527,9,i love my echo!  it has amazing sound and i love what it can do for making my home a ¡°smart home¡±. bought one for my parents too for their holiday gift and they love it too.....highly recommend!
8528,14,"if i could give it zero stars i would. i had it two days and it stopped working. worst thing is, i got it as a gift and can not swap it for a new one. i was really excited and had been thinkin about purchasing one. glad i did not waste my money."
8529,1,the sound is wonderful and alexa is responsive in any part of my home.  love it.
8530,0,"it is a neat gadget!  it is been fun experimenting.  one issue, i figured when i put the app on my phone alexa would recognize my number, not so.  i need to go back and figure it out as well as the tons of other functions."
8531,14,"the ""personality"" alexa has is amazing, the sound quality is great, the the skills like making lists that show up on you phone...brilliant.  voice commands are a bit lacking"
8532,10,alexa is great!  phenomenal device.  everything i hoped for.
8533,10,amazon eco 2nd generation is its best product so far. from checking the weather to news updates once you wake up and get ready for work/school it is convenient. with social gatherings having multiple egos through out the hosue playing music is a big plus.
8534,1,good (not great) sound quality.works well with my smart devices
8535,11,i loved this so much that i bought a second one.  the sound quality is beautiful.
8536,0,love echo it is great for what i use it for which is mainly music but other features works well but they do need more compatible apps to go with
8537,0,"i think it works great, has great quality sound. the only thing that kept me from giving it the 5 stars is the fact that it is not wireless. i know for the use of the home and what not but wireless things are always better. other than that i love the thing."
8538,2,met my expectations!  i like the sound and size the most.
8539,14,our amazon echo app is not working. we cannot connect it.
8540,1,great product!
8541,8,love it
8542,0,"the music selection is vast however it does not play genre. when i ask for today is country, i get some strange station that could be rock. does not make sense. the sound quality is great! i know there is more to explore for me to understand"
8543,3,"works very well. needed a little programming, but all is well now."
8544,9,love it
8545,0,love it great way to have music playing and can answer most questions.
8546,1,great!
8547,0,still lots of glitches but it is cool
8548,3,"did not know i needed this until i had it...fantastic! many tools to make life easier, more fun, and more productive!"
8549,8,great product!!!!
8550,4,so easy and entertaining
8551,14,will not allow you to turn off beyonce. lol tried to turn it off and kept going and ignored my request to stop
8552,11,the sound is fantastic and has the same great ai.
8553,11,like the low slender design and the sound is very clear and audible with a good deep bass.
8554,11,"love the sound, the oakwood style a perfect match with my bedroom look. highly recommended"
8555,1,good product. in particular the speakers provide excellent sound quality.
8556,11,it works and sounds so much better than the dot. so far i have had none of the troubles i had with the dot. whoopee !! i hope it keeps on doing as well...
8557,14,"the sound is incredible for size. i use it mostly for music, while i learn other uses im 88 yrs, so alittle slow, also impressed with info  get from alexa very happy we bought it."
8558,11,love this and use it all the time. the sound quality is significantly better than a dot.
8559,9,could not live without alexa!  great sound and knowledge.  bought a second one for a family member because they were so impressed with ours!  even tells you a joke when prompted.
8560,14,this thing is completely useless unless you buy amazon prime music subscription or whatever it is
8561,0,"we absolutely love alexa...but if you leave her plugged in she will, periodically, randomly start talking to you and it is creepy."
8562,0,"sound is great, however, when i  asked for a jazz station and said play stan getz, i  expected nothing but s getz, not carlos santana as the 2nd song.  if i  request an artist, that is all i  want to hear, not multiple others"
8563,12,this was a gift and i have enjoyed exploring all that she can do. wow!
8564,14,"it would not stay linked w/wifi-unusable...sooo, i sent it back!"
8565,14,"difficult to install, but finally worth it. still trying to link it to my calendar after hours of trying."
8566,10,"this devise is so much fun!  i was on vacation last week and was surprised how much i missed being able to just shout out a question, make a list, play music, etc."
8567,3,arrived fast works great
8568,9,i love the echo!!!
8569,7,i absolutely love it!! <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0089>
8570,12,we loved it! good quality product!!
8571,5,i bought this as a christmas gift for my son. he absolutely loves it. awesome gift idea!
8572,10,"i like that alexa can play any music i am in the mood to listen to, write things on my shopping list wheni am busy, tell jokes to entertain, and answer so many questions.  amazing piece of equipment."
8573,0,love this product i take it everywhere with me sounds verrrrrrryyyyy gooooood worth the buck you should get it what are you waiting for lol......
8574,14,i bought this for my parents after i received one as a gift. it is perfect for just the two of them.  it will play pretty much any song (with music unlimited subscription) and its very simple to use and navigate through. they love it!
8575,0,"love this!! music sound is wonderful! newsflash is ok, sometimes repeating same news each day. there is a learning curve to asking it to play certain songs ."
8576,10,huge fan of my echo! almost all of my smart home devices are set up with it.
8577,0,will review once it works
8578,10,"just starting to play with this system and all how it works.  but i just setup my first pair for playing music in the house and it is great.  simple to use, sound great and really quick in voice commands and getting music."
8579,4,it is fun to operate.
8580,12,really like it. have not yet figured out all it will do.
8581,1,it is just a marvelous product
8582,11,"the sound is so much better than the first generation, it is almost has to much bass and the treble is not completely crisp but still really good.  also no portable battery stand that seem reliable based on review.  overall 8.5 out of 10 overall."
8583,12,so far it has been great have not got to use it much but when i have seems great !!
8584,14,i love the color and texture but the only problem i had is that it involuntarily charged me for the unlimited music which i did not want so i think it is a little too sensitive and now i took all of my credit cards off of amazon
8585,14,"fantastic product,went from stone ages to smart home"
8586,14,that sound is still poor. the way that you made the new sound sound it is not exactly what you said it would be i would have to buy speakers if i wanted to use it for anything other than talking.
8587,11,its an echo - what else can you say.the cover does seem to muffle the sound a bit but she is awesome.
8588,11,can not really hear the difference between 1st gen and 2nd gen but a super useful little device.
8589,3,better than i expected
8590,12,i love the echo! truly amazing.
8591,14,"the most disappointing thing about the echo is it is in ability to do internet searches. also there is no capability to church out audio books from your public library , you have to subscribe to a service to get audio books."
8592,10,"works perfectly for my music, asking basic questions, weather for the day, price of gold.  i am sure as i get time i will use lots more features."
8593,0,"sound is good. i was hoping the question answering would be better. mostly says "" i do not know that"""
8594,3,i love it. you do not know you need one until you have it.
8595,14,"felt like it was spying on us!! would say ""hello"" randomly without saying ""alexa"" and even applauded out of nowhere. i liked the convience factor but overall my privacy wins! i do not recommend unless you like being spied on."
8596,14,awesome sound!  i love my  echo!  keeps me on track with reminders and very easy to use.  i wish it was rechargeable and able to be moved with having to unplug from electric source.
8597,10,my daughter is very happy with it.
8598,14,"love it, but set up could be made simpler."
8599,0,"fun, but i do not like it listening on its own. if i want it to listen to me i will ask her to.make it smarter, i have asked several simple questions that it can not answer, but the cellphone can."
8600,0,you ask alexis to play a song and she plays it. the actor for the weather where you are at and she gives it to you. there is a lot more alexis can do butt i love the music.
8601,10,"i like that i can get the weather report, music and info but just asking out loud.  it was not easy to setup."
8602,4,fun easy to use..great sound
8603,10,"it entertains me. i spend time trying to learn what alexa can do that is new. i love the ability to ask for music to be played in the odd moments that i am not reading etc. also alexa is quite good at obeying my ""alexa stop"" command."
8604,10,"this was a christmas gift from our daughter and family...one of the best gifts ever!! we love the music, asking her questions, weather reports and ¡°head space¡± is awesome. would recommend this product to anyone!!"
8605,12,i still need to learn what all it can do but i am enjoying it so far
8606,1,the sound is great.  the skills are fun for everyone.
8607,2,love it!
8608,0,works great for most things! annoying part is amazon wants you to buy a music subscription to listen to songs:( i just listen to iheart radio so its basically a radio.
8609,10,i love my echo and i¡¯m a music lover so i use it every day. love amazon music and it can also play my pandora music. i also like asking about the weather each morning.
8610,1,great buy
8611,10,we love it!  so much fun.  have put away our bulky cd player and strictly use this.  sound is wonderful.
8612,14,works great easy to hook up to wifi and external speaker talk to alexa all day for information music weather all kinds of content. would like to be able to connect to a second speaker
8613,14,"interesting device. right now i only use it to play music and give me a flash briefing. expensive as a speaker but if you have an expendable income, it is nifty."
8614,0,i love it.  it does everything you ask it to do.  it is fun to ask it questions.  i listen to all my favorite songs and do not have to wait for the radio to hopefully play them.
8615,8,love this thing
8616,9,love it.  my husband plays with it constantly. i love that alexa responds immediately. the only glitch right now seems to be with spotify. but i expect we can work that out. thanks for making my husband is life so much fun.
8617,9,"it was an unexpected gift from my brother.  i never thought i would have any use for ""alexa"" but sh is now my best buddy : )"
8618,2,love our alexa~
8619,8,loved it
8620,10,she gets smarter every day. i added the echo show to my arsenal.
8621,0,need more functionality.you have to spend way more money to buy extra things to work with that. they should at least give us some plug samples or something.
8622,11,i love it. i have the original and this one is definitely a step up.
8623,11,nice loud speakers. no complaints. it is a little heavy though.
8624,0,i love using it! it is great use and automate things around the house. response time is so fast that sometimes it is like you are talking to a real person.
8625,14,great sound quality and have to find an artist they do not have in the music library.  my only complaint is the volume does not quite get loud enough to hear throughout the house.  a second echo to sync with the first will cure this though.
8626,10,i absolutely love my alexa! i received it as a christmas present and since then i use her almost every day. everything from reminders to questions i¡¯m too lazy to google. plus she plays music and the speaker is actually quite good. highly recommend!
8627,0,"still learning echo working on skills.trying to get her to my local radio station heart radio station ho radio 101 youngstown,ohio she keeps going to usa 101 this is not the correct station. will keep trying. i do like this product. thanks"
8628,0,"love the sound, love the responsibility. sometimes i wish it answered more questions akin to a google home.would i buy it again? absolutely, i am a music junkie and this thing pumps out some music"
8629,4,great quality and sound as well as ease of use.
8630,14,love it!  just wish they had more music options and podcast like the google home has
8631,9,my husband and i bought this for his parents for christmas 2017. they absolutely love it! they said it was easy to set up and use. our daughter even loves to play dance party as she asks for different disney songs to play!
8632,11,"this works great and the sound system is awesome, compared with my echo dot. we love it."
8633,11,"i love the echo as this is my second one, however, the sound on my 1st generation is much better than the 2nd generation. i would have bought the echo plus because it is identical to my 1st generation had i known."
8634,10,"still finding new things. emails from amazon and you tube videos are very helpful.  asking alexa for information does not always work--many times, asking the same question in a different way works.  want to get one for my bedroom too.  :-)"
8635,1,really am enjoying alexa. love the music.
8636,9,i am in love. it has good sound and seriously awesome features. it might make me a little lazy though....
8637,9,awesome!
8638,14,"still in it is infancy, but fun and intriguing none the less! i hope soon, it will be more engaging and have better manners!!"
8639,10,we most enjoy the shopping list so far.  the music at request is also fun:)
8640,10,"alexa is amazing! from the music to the news reports , quizzes and podcasts. would recommend to anyone and buy the plug ins great for coming home after dark to turn on the lights! sound quality is amazing as well."
8641,10,love my echo a/k/a alexa.  love listening to whatever music i want when i want.
8642,2,this is my first echo and i love it!! the sound is fantastic!
8643,14,"first things first.  this device is not user friendly.  i just spent two hours trying to get it going.  after four factory resets and reprogramming did i get it working.  two turn off when you have company over, or place it in a private room, because this thing responds to everyone and will do weird unexpected things.  we¡¯ve had it making phone calls based on what a guest said, or playing loud rap music.  the instructions it comes with are fairly bare.  amazon informs you that the echo device will do several tasks, but does not tell you how to do it, or what other accessories you need to acquire, and none of this equipment is cheap. amazon does provide pretty good customer service, which warrants s 5 star.  it is unfortunate i can not give the same for this product.  it is pretty techy and if all you want is music this may work.  i give it a zero on everything else"
8644,10,"it was a gift that i really had no interest in receiving. once i received it, i now use it all the time, when hanging around the house for sports updates and for playing my genre  of music when requested."
8645,8,love it
8646,11,great product. second one that i have purchased.
8647,10,using the new echo is the cheapest and easiest way for someone to set up a speaker system all over the house. i also got amazon music and i have yet to stump it. it is awesome to have any kind of music wherever and whenever you want it.
8648,10,terrific.. i am a music lover... all genres.... alexa comes through with the requests
8649,12,we are still learning but so far we are enjoying what alexa can do.
8650,12,love this device although i still have much to learn... not maximizing it is capabilities yet.
8651,0,"ease of programming the echo. however, alexa does always understand commands, and gives an answer that is what the echo thinks is correct."
8652,10,"quick and easy for music, weather and news."
8653,0,very easy set up!! hard to find the right battery base.
8654,14,what a great device! love all i know it can do and excited to figure out all the other possibilities! you can use your phone as a remote. 2nd gen voice recognition reaches farther as well
8655,8,kids love it!
8656,14,i liked all the options it has.  i do not like the fact they disconnect with my network all the time.  also i had to spend 150.00 for a hub so that the echo could control my directv service.
8657,9,i love the convenience of being able to ask her anything and i love her choice of music. i bought three for my family and they love them.
8658,13,one of the best echo i ever had
8659,8,love it!
8660,14,"for whatever reason  i can not tune in radio stations with a standard radio in my home, so we must use internet radio.  echo does a great job of quickly picking up the station and not losing signal."
8661,0,i love it for music.  i have asked several questions re:  the world news and she did not have the answer. but that is okay!!!
8662,9,"i gave my girlfriend the echo as a christmas gift. she was elated before she even had a chance to hook it up. while i do not experience alexa on a day to day basis, i know my girlfriend loves it and uses it often."
8663,14,i love my echoe speakers. i bought 2 and spaced them out. i play music in the everywhere group so music is played simultaneously. gives a fuller sound in that way in my opinion. definitely loud enough for entertaining in my apartment.
8664,9,"it was a gift, we love it. it should compatible with our control 4 soon!!"
8665,10,"received as a gift. alexia knows 90% of my ¡°off the wall¡± questions, tells nice jokes. sings like me (bad). totally enjoy it!!!"
8666,0,i can get howard stern on sirious and great music from popular and current to classical
8667,9,i received this as a christmas gift from my son.  i was really impressed with the sound quality and the quick response.  i would recommend this product.
8668,9,i have 2 in my home! i love them!
8669,14,"it sounds great and with more microphones it is a lot better then the first gen , i hope to see more skills in the future, and i am sure i will the developers are constantly adding to this product, i would recommend it to anyone"
8670,10,i like the sound
8671,10,my wife thinks it s great!
8672,9,"answers my questions intelligently.  this was actually a gift for my husband for christmas.  he has enjoyed talking with alexa, and loves that he can get an answer to a question without having to look it up on the computer."
8673,9,love this thing might have to get one for another room.
8674,12,easy to use and set up. love all the skills she can do!
8675,0,the sound quality is great! the echo is the perfect device for a smart home. the only issue i have is sometimes you have to be too specific for alexa to find/do what you ask.
8676,11,"i did not choose the color, but it is very nice. it goes with my room very nicely."
8677,10,love my echo. use it everyday to fine out the weather and other things. also it is great just to listen to music because of the great sound.
8678,5,loved it..
8679,5,this was a christmas gift.  recipient is having much fun with the unit.  function and fun.  perfect gift.
8680,9,bought for a gift.  heard that they love it.
8681,0,i thought alexa was going to be smart. she constantly says i dont know to my questions. all she is really good for is to play music and smart key if you hook it up.
8682,10,it looks so nice and unobtrusive. alexa has improved her searches too
8683,14,i received as a gift and it has been the best!!!  if you are on the fence trying to decide to buy or not... do it! ...you will not be disappointed.
8684,10,"love it, once we figure it all out and start adding smart gadgets it will be intetesting."
8685,0,does not work majority of the time.
8686,1,this thing sounds awesome for such a small device. 100% satisfied. kids love it.
8687,14,"i really being able to get accurate temp, first thing when i wake up in the morning. here where i live it has been so cold even my dog appreciates know why she cannot stay out to long, ha! ha!"
8688,9,great sound. easy set up. my new best friend!!!
8689,0,"alexa is my favorite family member. she always listens and does what i ask her, she likes the same music as me and she always speaks clearly. love this product!"
8690,10,"love it. i have it in my kitchen, and use it everyday for music and weather. i thought these things were a joke, but now i want to put more of them in my house."
8691,12,love this thing.. just scrapping the top of capabilities. can not wait to figure out everything this thing can do.
8692,10,hi i like the clarity and quality of sound the best. the ease of use is helpful. it is great starting out the day with a joke from alexa. i am listening to more music since i have the echo. thanks.
8693,12,so far we love it.
8694,0,"it was a gift and it does not do anything i can not do.  to test it, i asked for certain songs to be played and it did not know the songs."
8695,10,"sound is amazing! very loud with good base! it is clear i do not need a music sound system with this. it has worked well for my house gatherings and parties, it is a lot of fun! anything i need to know i can just ask alexa :) love it!!"
8696,9,gave these as gifts! everyone loves!
8697,12,this is awesome.  the sound quality is great. i¡¯m sure we are not taking advantage of all it is capabilities.
8698,1,great
8699,4,definitely fun and easy to use
8700,0,ask alexa - she will tell you
8701,10,"i have enjoyed my product.  it has played all my music to my enjoyment.  i would recommend it, yes."
8702,1,i am very pleased with my echo. it is easy to work with and the sound is wonderful when i play music.
8703,12,getting the hang of all it can do.  amazing!
8704,1,i love this little machine... great sound...
8705,10,"loved the sound and all of alexa is capabilities. the whole family has enjoyed the timers, alarms, music and instant answers to our crazy questions. also loved the game and the ease of all this while sitting at my desk."
8706,11,"this is a powerful, room filling speaker. there is nothing to not love about it. i have it on the wood floor in the corner of my living room and it sounds like a large stereo. i would definitely buy it again."
8707,1,great sound for music. very useful and fun
8708,10,easy to use and fun to have things turn on by your voice.
8709,14,"a nice sound from a small device.  add amazon music and you have got a real treat!  do not expect this to replace your stereo and it would be nice if it were portable, but still a worthwhile purchase."
8710,11,great
8711,1,good product
8712,0,"really have not used the machine much. bought the prime music, but many times the game cho can not find the songs. not sure it is worth the money, infact pretty sure it is not. sure wouldnt waste the money on the music add on!"
8713,11,very happy with the versatility.
8714,4,it works great and is a lot fun!
8715,10,excellent add to any household. helps with kids' random questions that alexa can answer. helps with math and keeping them entertained with music for dancing and singing.
8716,5,gift for mom she loves it
8717,1,good sound from a small speaker!
8718,10,very easy to use have to speak loud and clear for her to listen signed up for amazon music and a lot of the songs she cannot recognize or find overall its great we use it for music weather and for smart home products.
8719,10,cool gadget. i like it. you can ask it questions and play games with it when you are bored. i bought it for my wife because she wanted one and we both enjoy it. it does all kinds of cool stuff.
8720,11,not as good as the more expensive echo but very close.
8721,9,works well in my wife is office.
8722,14,alexa gets to be a great help around the house
8723,10,what a great product! we love to ask questions and listen to music.
8724,10,still learning what i can do. i like the ask alexa emails that you send out. keep sending them.
8725,0,"this was a gift.  not something i would have bought.  so far not impressed. can not answer most of my search questions, end up using google on my phone."
8726,14,alexa works well. nice sound. but will not find business unless its in your contacts.
8727,10,"as always, love our echo is!"
8728,14,exceeded our expectations....  what a creation!wish it were easier to lower the sound... perhaps we can ask alexa to do it by command?  that would solve the only issue i see.
8729,0,it does not sound as good in a carpeted area instead of hard floors. it is nice to have music at your fingertips but you will need to have some paid type of music source to get the songs..
8730,0,we  love the echo! we call friends with it. i like the fact that i can listen to any type of music i want any time i want! we are still learning stuff with it so what i like least i could not say! she is really fun  to talk to! i love her
8731,1,"this item is awesome, i love it, especially for spelling & music! i highly recommend eco 2nd gen!"
8732,10,"i love the versatility. i can make lists, check the weather, have her tell me jokes, etc. i am considering getting a dot for upstairs."
8733,9,absolutely love it! very fun to play with and very useful! i ordered 3 more for my children!!!
8734,1,this has a good quality speaker and looks good in my kitchen
8735,1,it is good
8736,14,its work amazing. 95% of the time it work smooth. the speaker really clear sound.
8737,14,the echo has a long way to go to catch up to the google home as an ai home unit. i prefer to use them mostly for my home automation and google home brings that way better than having to constantly pamper alexa by teaching her new things.
8738,9,i can communicate with it from several rooms and it is speakers are plenty for my small house..
8739,14,the music worked okay for a while and then quit. it needed some sort of registration. i¡¯m sending it back.
8740,8,great! we really love it!
8741,9,so much louder.  love it!
8742,14,everything went smoothly.
8743,0,"awesome, internet at my voice command"
8744,10,we are loving alexa. makes shopping lists easy and getting news highlights
8745,4,love it. convenient. easy set up
8746,10,"i have yet to learn all it will do, but i love the lists.  playing music is a snap.  she answers almost any question you ask and even plays jeapordy with you.  can not wait to learn more."
8747,9,"this gadget is awesome but i would like to know how to connect it to our tv and other things( lights, phone)"
8748,0,i like these things.
8749,14,can not go wrong with the echo alexa does alot of different things and is very helpful.
8750,11,i have a first generation echo and my new one is improved in sound and appearance.
8751,14,sound is great. as far as answering questions or assistance it is very limited. i hope it will improve in the future. my next purchase will be the goggle speaker to test and decide how many i will buy in the future from either company
8752,10,the speaker on this device is great.  i like that i¡¯m able to use voice commands for spotify.  this is a really neat device that i wish i would have gotten a long time ago!
8753,9,the echo is great my husband loves it and i love it too. we use it every day it is one of the best purchases that i bought from amazon. i want to have one in every room!!!!
8754,9,"purchased 1 for wife, she loved it, bought 2 more!  can not imagine living without her now!  lol!!!"
8755,14,awesome device. hands down one of the best if not best products produce by amazon.  will definitely be purchasing the echo plus and all smart home accessories.  the future is here and her name is alexa.
8756,0,i listen to music on this thing pretty much every time i go to bed but the thing i like the least about it was some things i said it was not sure what it was or you had to repeat it several times but other than that it was a great system
8757,12,great
8758,14,how awesome to just say what much  you want to listen to and poof! it is playing your song. whenever i realize i am out of something i can tell alexa to order it and poof! it is order. magical piece of technology
8759,10,i use it for weather updates. i play music. grandchildren like we alexa tells them a joke and makes a fart sound.
8760,8,love it.
8761,1,good quality
8762,14,"i was researching bluetooth speakers for a while and finally settled on this.  the sound is pretty powerful considering their size.  i am still trying to figure out all that they can do, but so far i am very happy with my decision."
8763,8,love it.
8764,14,the echo is a great addition to our household due to its usefulness and ease of setup.  sadly it died after 2 weeks and had to be returned.  looking forward to its return.
8765,10,"love this echo too much! so nice for making lists, listening to any kind of music, finding out information by asking alexa.... too much to name. did not know this type of technology was available as i got it as a gift and i am enjoying it so much."
8766,9,i like the sound and it hears me ver well
8767,14,"gave this to my parents who use it daily. they feel left out, technologically speaking, and this echo helped catapult their coolness factor with their older friends. they use it all day long!"
8768,14,improve my quality of living. great safety nets.
8769,10,i love it as a timer to keep me on schedule. whenever i go somewhere i tell it to play music to keep my dog occupied. i find many uses every day.
8770,14,"love it.amazon, please invest in expanding your infrastucture in ukraine, at least add russian or ukrainian languages!anyway, waiting for fire tv..."
8771,1,wonderful product.
8772,14,the 2nd generation echo was not at all what it was advertised to be by amazon.  the main reason i bought it was for the improved sound that was part of the advertisement but after testing it out it was lower in volume and bass than the original echo.  i returned it.
8773,2,i love it! alexa is my new friend!
8774,9,we love the echo and about an hour into starting it up my daughter-in-law decided they had to have one!
8775,10,alot of fun
8776,14,does not recognize words as good as google
8777,14,nice hardware. did not realize you had to pay for music. very disappointed!
8778,4,"love it! very easy to set up and works well, even with my iphone!"
8779,1,it is a fun purchase
8780,14,sounds wonderful. the echo second generation is the perfect size for what i wanted. i did have a problem setting up app was not easy to follow.  still not sure if i got it right but it works. would recommend.
8781,4,very easy to set up.
8782,10,alexa is very entertaining and very bright. she almost always can answer our questions. the speakers on the echo are such quality that we love playing our music on it. very happy to have alexa in our home!
8783,14,"everything the description said it would be and more! even bought a echo dot for my bedroom so i could talk to alexa at night. i can check my trip to work, what is in my cart, turn my tv on and off and play games with family and friends!"
8784,11,this was easily the best christmas present the speaker quality on the amazon echo 2nd generation is superb.
8785,14,"this thing is a miniature beast. you gotta get amazon music with it, i love how you can ask alexa to play any song. there is no delay and the device is pretty loud at volume 10. love this thing!"
8786,10,quality sound of music & alexa is quick answers to questions is what i like best.
8787,10,its  an amazing  badge and i especially love  that it  will play my sirius /xm  stations
8788,8,"love it, and sounds great."
8789,8,super awesome. we love it!
8790,10,i love using her for music and asking her questions that we would normally ask google
8791,11,makes life just a little bit easier. looks great. sound is ok; not amazing but definitely worth the money.
8792,11,the sound  is so much better than previous echos
8793,14,i loved the skills and enhancements it was able to gain. i did not like the fact that there were some songs that i wanted to hear in live versions or acoustic versions that could not be found when i asked for them no matter how i asked for them.
8794,9,find it very use full.  house is big so i bought this to be my second one.
8795,12,it is so fun and you can listen to so much music with it.
8796,14,works great. just remember there are a lot of additional purchases to use it to its full potential.
8797,14,"its interface was problematic then once i learned it tried to access every computer file in our house i shut it down and gave the damn thing away to a younger fool.  word to the wise , skip this ""bitch"" and keep your data safe."
8798,11,"i love the sound quality, the value (had flex pay plan).  will definitely reorder."
8799,14,the sound needs a base and treble adjustment for it for those of us who do not understand sounds ie. tone deaf.  i really enjoy every thing else about my echo and its spokes lady alexa.
8800,9,i love my echo! the sound is amazing and it is really convenient to play music or check the weather or news hands free. it was a gift for christmas and i have not stopped using it since.
8801,0,"very impressed. i¡¯m not a millennial, so i needed a bit of help getting it going, but love it.also wanted to put a shout out to the guy who helped me at the cherry creek mall!"
8802,14,overall happy with my echo. it still does not work with my harmony remote. i reported it to amazonand was told it was a known issue on but no resolve as of today.
8803,10,"i love it.  i love to listen to music, make shopping lists, even set alarms.  it is more than we expected.  you should sign up for amazon unlimited music though - makes a big difference."
8804,9,got this for my 90 year old mother. she loves it  gives her all the info she needs just by asking
8805,3,what did i do for music before this??? what a great product!!
8806,7,<f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+008a>
8807,11,i have not had much time to use it but to date i do not notice an improvement in the sound. it is shorter than tha original version but that does not excite me.
8808,0,"absolutely love this little gem. i mainly wanted it for the music feature. connected it to pandora.however, my daughter in college ask allot of questions pertaining to her studies. sometimes ""alexa"" does not know the answer..... :)"
8809,10,i really like it but only got to use it for a week before leaving town for the winter.
8810,9,very tmely same day delivery. easy to set up. very happy with purchase and ordered second one for upstairs.
8811,11,the sound is really incredible and fills room up nicely. i wish i had bought one with hub rather than adding it separate
8812,9,fun gadget that is addicting. now use it every day for briefings and music. better sound quality than i expected.
8813,10,who does not get a kick out of alexa?? so much fun.
8814,14,the echo was ok.  disappointed in what is offered without amazon prime
8815,10,installation was easy. alexa is a blast and makes many things easy.  our autistic son enjoys asking her questions and getting her to play music.
8816,8,love this!
8817,10,we listen to music much of the time
8818,0,i really love she actually listens compared to siri
8819,14,it is much better than dot.  it is louder and deep tone than the other because i am deaf and my wife is partial deaf.  we can able to hear it better.  two thumbs up.
8820,10,we love our echo. i purchased it for my busy salon where we do not have radio reception. all of us are entertained by the steady stream of any genre we can think up. thank you!
8821,11,i love my echo. i keep buying the next updated version.
8822,11,much better sound and mic pickup.
8823,14,"she gives a good weather report, but can not remind when to take a pill. rather limited skill set."
8824,1,a great idea very useful
8825,14,"i wash the unit could handle bass a little better.  when talking to others there is not a volume issue.  when playing music i also wish the unit would level the music, i spend a lot of time asking volume up and down."
8826,4,works well
8827,14,sounds great can give a five still in testing window
8828,2,love this 2nd gen echo.
8829,11,luv my unit. works as stated!
8830,10,i like that i can ask questions and get good results. she tells me time and weather. i use ambient sounds to sleep. i along with my echo are still learning.
8831,11,better than anything before it!
8832,1,"i love this, i use it primarily for music and it sounds great!"
8833,1,happy with the product.
8834,9,"unbelievable,  did not think we needed it, but after setup, my whole family loved finding all the things alexa could do!"
8835,13,i absolutely love this!!! best gift ever!!!
8836,10,"i really like my echo.  alexa gives me the weather every morning,  plays music i ask for.  and we can play games"
8837,0,i am really enjoying it.  i have not figured out to play music on my phone with the music unlimited yet though.
8838,11,"cons: it would be much better if it is portable, built in rechargeable battery, sometimes it does not get the voice commands, or takes a while.pros: good sound, nice design,"
8839,12,a lot of fun! still trying to learn all it can do
8840,5,great gift
8841,11,much better sound than the echo dot. worth the upgrade if you want to listen to music on your echo.
8842,14,difficult as a blind persone to set up...  reset instruction was a picture that requires vision to see.
8843,10,loving it !
8844,14,great purchase! works as it suppose to!
8845,14,say word!  should have bought one.of these long ago
8846,9,way more fun and useful then i expected! i tried one and bought three more. love it!
8847,0,very intertaining
8848,10,"we never thought we would really use our echo as much as we have!  we listen to music, create lists, use skills.  it is so nice to have!  still discovering all it can do!"
8849,14,"it is truly amazing how well this thing works. almost any piece of music i ask for even odd stuff like delta blues and ""weird"" folk it seems to be able to fing"
8850,14,able to turn it up loud enough for those hard of hearing.
8851,7,"this echo is so easy to set up and use, playing music, converting recipes, checking the current news and weather.  the sound is pretty good too <f0><u+009f><u+0091><u+008c>"
8852,0,"i love the echo. anything i have asked of it, i have gotten an answer, i mostly use it for music. i just say the name of a song, (or sometimes just a line of the song) and it plays it. i am beside myself in love with this thing."
8853,14,"alexa is part of the family now.  you will be surprised at what she can answer.  quality product, and i was quite surprised at the richness and quality of the sound this little speaker makes."
8854,11,as many have mentioned sound quality is not as good as first generation also miss the volume control with ring on the top
8855,1,"fun to use, nice speaker for music streaming"
8856,1,"great look, nice sound"
8857,10,really enjoy getting to know alexa
8858,1,"great product. the quality of the sound is excellent, the music is very clear. it is amazing that alexa can hear me from any were. i love this amazon product."
8859,14,sometimes my second generation echo wil just quit in the middle of the sound machine or music for no reason. i also have a first generation echo that never has that problem.
8860,8,enjoy it
8861,11,love it. blends in my living room.
8862,12,"i¡¯m still learning, but i like it!"
8863,0,can not get it to connect
8864,5,they loved it!  perfect gift.
8865,0,"she does not talk back at me, i like her"
8866,11,good sound. not crazy about the cloth cover
8867,0,it does not permit you to do reoccurring events.  not sure yet what other things it does not do.  there should be a list of how to speak to this thing.
8868,9,good sound quality. have mostly used to play music.  it was a gift. plan on getting another one!
8869,10,great sound. plays more songs than i thought it would
8870,10,"a great help to turn on and off lights, get the news and weather in the morning and the question of the day.  it is nice to ask alexa to play music while i am cooking dinner. now i just need her to make dinner and i will be all set."
8871,9,"i bought this for my ""skeptical"" husband and he loves it! totally amazed by all it can do!  the music selection is perfect for us!"
8872,12,it is so much fun and i love it
8873,14,"great product at a great price.  i bought a sonos one, but it never worked. all i wanted it to do was let me use alexia and connect to pandora, but i finally threw it away and bought another echo.  really good sound quality and so convenient."
8874,8,we love it
8875,8,works well
8876,1,works great. great speaker.
8877,14,sound quality on music. least favorite does not always play or under stand takes a couple of tries. sometimes it is truely easier to just turn the radio on
8878,14,i placed it in a bedroom and am impressed with the sound.
8879,5,gave it to my 12-year-old grandson for his birthday and he loves it.
8880,0,i love that it can answer a lot of questions and i do not have to look it up. i love al the music but sometimes do not like that it  only gives a preview of a song.
8881,14,asked numerous times for a volume change and it shows on history when i opened the application.  alexa stated each time sorry i did not get that and did not alter volume until the last time .
8882,14,"excellent sound quality. disappointed i can not bring it outside or to another room without plugging it in somewhere. the other two i bought had a charging base, that was first generation. although one held a charge longer than the first."
8883,11,sounds great...but not all the functionality i expected.
8884,10,fun and friendly household virtual assistant. great for controlling lights and receiving answers to questions.
8885,9,great addition to the echo and dot
8886,9,loved this item for my in laws and they are enjoying immensley
8887,1,clarity is wonderful. quick response time is quite good
8888,11,looks and sounds great. i like that it is shorter than the echo plus and the silver color looks great in my home .
8889,0,"i think that the sound is great for music, but when it comes to answering alot of my questions, it has no answers. also when using skills , it.s hard to remember the connection callouts."
8890,14,have 2 .. ones great .. the other is dumber than dirt...
8891,10,"i love mine, and i love alexa. great room-filling sound."
8892,1,works ok
8893,9,how did we ever live without this? awesome
8894,14,"audio quality is excellent for such a small device.  microphone pickup is good, but i have to repeat my requests twice more often than not.  i consider her another child, since i have to tell my kids twice to do everything anyway."
8895,9,we received as christmas from son and daughter-in-law. we are learning new ways to use every day. love it.
8896,0,echo is over priced for limited functions and use it provides. alexis is knowledge base is poor and when asked a lot of basic questions cannot answer them or answer them correctly. technology needs a lot of work to truly become useful.
8897,10,"i like how easy it was to set up and connect with other devices.  i enjoy having any kind of music any time i want it without having to turn on all the sound system equipment and/or changing cd is, radio stations, etc."
8898,3,performs as advertised
8899,1,music sounds great!
8900,8,love it!
8901,10,it is fun!  takes used to having it around to ask questions but we are getting the hang of it.  i like that i can tell alexa to put an item on my shopping list.
8902,14,"we love the echo!  we were going to have a sound system installed, but after receiving the echo, we decided we really did not need to spend the extra money.  the sound is great and will play virtually anything we ask.  thank you!!"
8903,10,able to get weather instantly. not able to hear some music.
8904,0,"alexa is an amazing thing to have. however, it does lose connection to the internet quite often."
8905,3,i so enjoyed this
8906,0,having a great time with our echo.  it works through out our house.  i can ask her a question in one part and she will answer...we have a 2200 sq ft home. still learning a lot about it and i am sure we are not using it to its full potential.
8907,0,"i love my alexa!  a bit frustrating sometimes to set it up whn you move it to different locations and the recognition is not perfect, but it is a lot of fun and the speaker is great."
8908,0,other then music....most things i ask her she says she does not know.
8909,14,30 day trial of music lasted less than 30 days. alexa has trouble understanding some simple commands. hoping it will get better over time.sound quality and volume is very good.
8910,12,this item has amazing sound. a lot of fun with all the new capabilities.
8911,10,we are having a lot of fun with this product!  the grocery list app is the best!
8912,8,great sound love it
8913,8,great sound!
8914,1,works great!
8915,10,"i use alexa a lot during the day. music, weather, jokes, timers etc. the only thing i do not like is that she picks up commands off the tv."
8916,8,love it!!
8917,12,"great sound! lots of possibilities and more being developed and released all the time. i love having so much information, entertainment and automation available."
8918,14,i really enjoyed receiving the echo.  i have had several name brands in speakers and i must say this one stands out.
8919,0,set up on smart phone was a little difficult but it works great!
8920,14,awesome
8921,0,"for the most part i am satisfied.  the sound experience is good, not great.  there could be more datato work with. i am sure as time goes on they will broaden the data to include the answers to more questions."
8922,11,good improvement
8923,10,"i love this device. i have amazon prime and use it to listen to amazon music and add items to my cart. i call people when i am making dinner and dont have a free hand. my husband was very skeptical, but even he uses it on a daily basis."
8924,14,just as described although it is a little creepy with amazon always listening in!
8925,14,so far works as stated. spotify commands could use some bug fixes. great voice recognition . love the compatibility with other products.
8926,1,we love it!  comes in very handy!  nice speaker for listening to music!
8927,12,this is so fun... i like everything about it... :)
8928,11,"this is my second echo. this one was for work.it is in a spa, so it is great that anyone can activate it.and the new size and colors fit nicely with the decor."
8929,3,"alexa is fun, we¡¯re enjoying it!!  thanks!"
8930,11,the all new echo is a total gamer changer. i love the fabric and wood options. sound is amazing.
8931,10,i love that it is so easy to set up and to use. easiest access to all music and so much more.
8932,10,i¡¯m really enjoying this product great sound. alexa hears everything including her name on tv
8933,14,"great speaker, alexa is sus because she is always listening. more of big bro but that is our modern age. would be great if it were wireless, or if any amazon speakers were. but i love it."
8934,4,so simple to set up and operate!
8935,8,i love alexa!!!!!!!!!
8936,14,extremely easy to set up and get going! now just assigning automation to it! awesome!
8937,14,love this thing good sound quality i think its a little pricey but what is not these days.
8938,3,"we tried the google home and this is so much simpler and more device friendly. great sound, does more than expected will buy another very soon!!!"
8939,14,the sound is wonderful and alexa follows directions well.  she still can not play music by les paul and mary ford. :(
8940,9,easy to use with endless possibilities. i got it as a christmas present and absolutely love it!
8941,1,we love talking to alexa! the sound quality is amazing! it is our new speaker for playing music!
8942,11,the sound is so much better than the echo dot. i got this speaker for better sound quality. it is actually enjoyable to listen to music through this speaker. the bass and tone of the music is so much deeper and wholesome than the dot.
8943,8,"absolutely love this, great purchase!"
8944,9,"i love this my echo! my 2 year old daughter and i have dance parties in the kitchen every night when i make dinner, she tellls me the weather, i can set timers, love love love <u+2764><u+fe0f>"
8945,11,love my echo and the gray color is subtly sophisticated.  nothing not to like with this purchase.
8946,0,"it has great sound when playing music but alexa do not know the answer to most questions i ask. i have spent since christmas perfecting her ""skills"" but i give up no wits no more than a speaker for music. very disappointed.."
8947,0,"i got this from my husband for my birthday and i love it! i love that you can ask about anything, play music, etc. i really like the color as well! the only thing id like more, is if it charged so i do not have to keep it plugged in"
8948,14,absolutely love this. coming from an apple person i hesitated to purchase. since then i have bought other echos and signed up for amazon unlimited music.
8949,11,the echo is easy to use with great sound quality. i am very impressed with the bass you get from a small speaker. still learning all the features and possibilities of the echo. setup was easy with the app.
8950,0,does what it supposed<u+200b> to do
8951,8,"love it, love it, love it"
8952,0,i do not like it at all. the instructions do not explain how to use it at all. does not tell you what appliances is needed to make it work for the house i can not connect it to my daughters in the other rooms it was just a waste to me
8953,10,"still learning all the bells and whistles but live it so far. music, weather and news reports are wonderful"
8954,12,we are still learning but everything is great. the sound is really good and we are having fun with it. i would recommend alexato everyone.
8955,10,i love the interaction!
8956,10,i love it. it is nice to ask questions and listen to music.
8957,14,love the echo. i can not figure out how to link it to my fire stick and get alexa to find movies as she does music and audible books.
8958,10,"love the first echo so much, we got the new one.  great sound when listening to music.  keeps us up to date with our favorite sports teams schedules."
8959,14,"the sound is wonderful. as a teacher, alexa is a great resource to use for answering questions or playing music to complement the classroom."
8960,10,i love being able to choose my music genre!  but it is being able to add items to my lists and access them on my phone that i like the most.
8961,9,we liked it so much - we bought one for the upstairs.
8962,12,i am enjoying alexa and all she can do.  it is great and a lot of fun
8963,2,love it
8964,11,great sounding! not wireless.
8965,14,"okay for basics  set up not easy wont drop in without smart phone, must pay for amozon music to have it research music"
8966,14,excellent product.  i use it mostly for radio programs i can not pick up locally.  works very well.  i only wish there was some control over the amount of bass.  great for music but for speech there is too much base at higher volume.
8967,0,"love it for getting weather first thing in the morning. was very easy voting for nba sll stars. sometimes she randomly says things, guess she heard me talking and says things. creepy... guess she is sleays listening"
8968,1,great sound quality
8969,0,works and sounds good. has a hard time hearing you when volume is up but i guess this is a bit expected
8970,14,"works great, but the echo arrived in a box that would fit 6-7 echos with no paper or other filler so the echo just bounced around inside the box until it arrived.  poor quality control of packaging for an electronic device amazon."
8971,14,"i specially like its functionality in playing the music i choose. no big setup when i want to move it outside, no delay in connecting. love the sound. most of all, i am enjoying exploring everything it can do. quite entertainng :)"
8972,8,awesome love it
8973,0,we love our alexa.  only wish she knew a little bit more information.  you also have to watch how you word a question.  but we love it!!
8974,14,i enjoy requesting a song and its played. very nice sound.  still have to figure out how to play dot in one place and echo in another place at the same time.
8975,10,it was very easy to set up. glad i can ask alexa to play my favorite radio station. my grandchildren have also asked verification on some completed homework.
8976,14,you are in desperate need of an equalizer to make this an all around product. in games the voice is garbled in music it is fine. stop ignoring what people are saying.
8977,0,i like that i can ask her a question which takes less time than looking it up on google. i do not like that i ask her simple questions and she does not always have an answer. i thought she had all info that is on the internet or in the cloud?
8978,0,good product the only problem i have with it is there is no internal battery so it needs to stay plugged in unless you buy the portable battery to go with it
8979,10,"love it. the convenience of simply talking to alexa and having her respond with weather, music, news, etc. is incredible. also, that you can link her to the smartthings hub and control lights and other items in the house is awesome."
8980,10,i am having a lot of fun with echo.  i love using it to play my favorite music.  the sound quality is excellent.  i also use the device as a timer and to give me a weather report in the morning.
8981,8,just amaizing.
8982,1,great product and price
8983,8,love it !!!!!!!!!!
8984,14,"i bought three echo units (alexa) and the initiation books for my granddaughters in brazil.however we are not able to work in brazil, although speaking in english..some special recommendation for use here in brazil"
8985,12,love this item. so much fun and so much information. love the responses and everyday i discover something new. best thing ever!
8986,8,love it
8987,1,great....
8988,9,bought it for my wife for christmas. i never dreamed she would use it as much as she does. great speaker for music....so fun.
8989,10,i was given the echo as a gift and did not really know what to expect. my two favorite features are the music streaming and having alexa make a grocery list!
8990,1,love it for playing music.....great sound and ease of use.
8991,14,we used it to replace our radio in the kitchen and thinking about getting a dot
8992,11,so much better than the google model.
8993,11,very powerful and nice in this version
8994,11,"easy to use and set up dont really have any complaints. sound is excellent for the size of the speaker, would pay a little more for an echo with even a better sound."
8995,14,"read a lot and think before you go for this. realize you are going not only for echo but also for alexa, and alexa is what provides the intelligence. so far, alexa has been nothing but disappointment. nothing works well or seamlessly. the instructions are nearly non-existent and fairly unhelpful. you can only set things up using the alexa app, but somehow the alexa app is not compatible with my samsung 7. music playback is only from your amazon account, and it is very flaky. new songs appear in my account and yet it can not find the ones i know i have. good luck if you have two versions of the same song from the same artist. you will never get it to find both. or all three. it is nothing but frustration so far. as usual, ""customer service"" is not something amazon is particularly good at nor do they seem to want to be. i would be happier if i had not tried to go down this road."
8996,14,i love my echo!  it is so much fun and was relatively easy to set up. my only problem is it drops off internet easily and will not reconnect until i unplug and reset everything.
8997,1,the sound quality is very good .also it is quite easy to install .stilllearning all its usefulness .
8998,14,love everything about it. our 4 g signal is weak where we have echo (bathroom far end of house) and the music stops at intervals. trying to figure out  a better solution.
8999,10,love our echo speaker.  check everything with alexa and the sound is great when we play music
9000,9,2nd one  love them
9001,14,"it was a little difficulty to get it set up in my name due to my friend not checking that it was a gift, but the customer service was wonderful and it was taken care of pretty quickly. alexa is a fun addition to the household!"
9002,1,love it. the sound is great!
9003,5,"got it for my mom, she loves it."
9004,14,"it is ok, but keeps disconnecting from the internet. this is extremely disappointing,  because she has to connected to my wi-fi  to be of any use. i really hate that i have to keep setting up her internet connection each day. :'("
9005,14,third one i have purchased. could not be more satisfied!
9006,1,love the new size and sound
9007,9,the whole family is loving alexia and all of the cool apps we can play with!
9008,14,great device with terrific sound for such a small enclosure.  still trying to figure out how to get access to google calendar.
9009,11,the speaker on this echo is much better than on the echo dot. i am pleased with my purchase.
9010,0,i love the echo but occasionally she does not quite understand what i am asking.
9011,1,"nice, and the speaker is loud."
9012,1,has great quality for it is price and size. very responsive and looks nice! i would buy it all over agin.
9013,12,so happy with our alexa!
9014,4,"love it! easy to set up, easy to use"
9015,12,"i am really enjoying this and so are my kids. i am still getting familiar with what it can do ,but so far so good.one thing i hope they can do updates to make alexa for personalized."
9016,0,"i love that alexa feels very much like a person, amazon has the ai part down pretty well. functionally however, it is pretty limited. my google home is much more useful, i find myself getting much more use out of it than the alexa"
9017,9,"alexa is great, everybody enjoys her."
9018,0,"a quick accurate response with questions, great with popular music, poor with jazz and classical."
9019,14,"i think it is nice to have, but it is not extremely useful right now with an apartment i can see it being better for homeowners."
9020,0,"this little device is so cool, it dose so much more then i ever dreamed it would...! i am very happy with this little lady...!"
9021,10,i love listening to the music of my life!!
9022,9,"i have adult children who have had one for quite awhile .... so we get it ... we may not use it as much as they do, but love the alexa aspect & will get used to it... we¡¯re older & it takes time !! music is the most used......"
9023,1,great toy.  lots of fun.
9024,12,i am still learning all echo can do for me.  so much fun.
9025,10,very easy to use and setup  i love the music library.  i do not like that i have to purchase multi family access to get music to play on my echo and dot
9026,14,impressive sound. nice look blends in and do not know it is there until you ask alexa something
9027,10,that i can ask alexa to play pandora radio stations for me and that i can voice control my thermostat.
9028,7,there is so much you can do. i am still learning <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+008a> the only thing that i would love to see or i should say hear is having a better volume.
9029,12,i love the echo.i love that i can do so much with it.
9030,12,works great. fun trying to get it to do stuff.
9031,0,"i like the weather, music, news, word of the day, spelling bee, and language practice (spanish)"
9032,11,after the firmware update these sounded much better. the firmware update was automatic after setup. the new mic set up is a lot more accurate than previous model as well. easy to set up and they look great.
9033,3,great item. everything i expected.
9034,9,"i have got music. i have got echo. i have got alexa, who can ask for anything more!"
9035,9,"love the sound, ease of use and flexibility. first step to more home automation, but love how this fits in our main living area.  will be buying more for the home soon."
9036,0,my only complaint is that i have to pay extra to access music!  should be included.
9037,4,great price and works excellently
9038,2,love my echo!!
9039,9,loving my echo!
9040,0,"not great, can not look things up for you, when asked to order something provides the most expensive option, does not play the morning report even after it was set up."
9041,10,product was new to me. i like echo and it is useful for music choices and some household tasks. i really enjoy it.
9042,12,we¡¯re having so much fun!  still learning all the capabilities but enjoying having it okay all kinds of music.  the sound is really great!
9043,14,music was fairly clear and strong. alexa was fun to work with. however i also bought a ¡°dot¡± but was not able to sync both to play the same music at the same time.
9044,10,"i love my echo from the sleek gray sleeve to the hours of entertainment and assistance from my new friend, alexa! it is also easy to connect and use!"
9045,0,it is fun if you can find out what it does can not answer many questions including the? what can you do  it does tell chuck norris jokes and play jeopardy should come with a booklet to start you off
9046,10,"i like it and find very easy to use.  i did need help to set it up, from my son is girlfriend after that it has been great.  the sound is great also; i use to play music while do a daily watercolour painting and puts me in my happy place."
9047,12,i like everything about it and i keep discovering new things every day!!
9048,11,works and sounds great - more responsive then the echo show
9049,12,i love it! it takes a bit to learn proper commands. but very neat item
9050,12,am enjoying this very much.
9051,10,inspirational quotes are corny but enjoying our echo.  do not have a smart house and will not use it for purchases
9052,5,it was. gift
9053,0,she is not learning fast enough and as far as i am concerned she is pretty stupid will not let me do much of anything with her
9054,14,did not live up to expectations. good for music but not much else yet.
9055,9,love this thing!! did not think i needed it till i bought it and now would be lost without it.  well worth the money and it does so many things.
9056,14,great product and my kids love it! but now i want the one with the video...
9057,9,i absolutely love my echo! i have had it for about 5 months and i can not imagine not having it! i love to listen to music because the sound is wonderful! great product all around!
9058,14,it is ok. i use it most for shopping lists. what needs improving is being able to remove items from list without going to computer. nice sound but adding speakers is to expensive.
9059,4,this product great and it definitely exceeded my highest expectations. i definitely recommended it to everyone...
9060,0,"""alexa"" does not ""have an opinion"" on a lot of the questions i ask. also she does not know much. i think we would be much happier with the google version on this. it is just not as cool as we expected it to be."
9061,14,this was a suprise gift. i have yet to consider how best to use it.  so far it does tell me how the weather is and play my type of music
9062,1,it is fine.
9063,3,alexa is way dumber than advertised.
9064,2,we love our echoes!!!
9065,0,still not sure what to do with it. currently only using it to listen to iheart radio
9066,1,great
9067,14,never connects to wifi
9068,14,at first i was not sure if i would like it or not but now i am very happy with it.
9069,9,my in-laws love this gift. set it up for them and it was super simple and easy to use.
9070,10,"love it. kids are having a blast with it.timers, groceries, music....whats not to like"
9071,11,"i have the first generation echo and it sounded so good i thought wow! one that sounds even better, it must be amazing! not!the 2nd generation sounds like a tin can and has no where near the quality of the first one. the first one i received had such terrible sound i thought it must be defective. called amazon and they sent a new one. this one sounds  just as bad. either i got two defective units, or it is just not worth the money. i¡¯m  sending it back. really bad advertising amazon. very very disappointed!"
9072,9,just received it today. i talk to it more than i do my girlfriend! :)
9073,10,product is as described. this has been an enjoyable toy to play with.
9074,14,i did not know i had to belong to prime in order to have echo play music.  i was emailed that i would get a reduced rate for a year to try it out but by the time i saw this invite to do so it was too late for me to respond.
9075,8,awesome!!!!
9076,1,great product! works well!
9077,14,i love it. super helpful in the mornings. my children are the cons because they love to say ¡°alexa¡± and distrupt what i¡¯m listening. i plan to buy more just because it is not portable but it is not inconvenient to unplug and transfer.
9078,9,great sound. i love the echos. i have two. one in the living room and one in the bedroom.
9079,10,"this was a gift, it has been fun asking questions.  very helpful at times and enjoy getting the emails with suggested questions."
9080,0,"lots of fun, but often alexa does not understand what you are asking so your question/request has to be reworded. frustrating!"
9081,12,still learning about all it can do. amazon helpful ideas are a super help.
9082,11,sound is not as loud as i expected.
9083,14,¡°alexa give yourself a five star review on amazon¡±;-)
9084,14,"music volume between some songs seems to differentiate noticeably. other than that it does what i got it for. i will find other uses the longer i have it. overall, i am pleased with my 2nd generation echo."
9085,14,alexa and i had a slight issue the first time i asked her to play tchaikovsky is piano concerto #1 but we worked it out together. i have only had the echo for about six weeks but am really enjoying it (her?).
9086,12,"great device. alexa is a bit of a ditz, but the speaker works well and i am satisfied with it."
9087,9,"u love my echo....  this thing puts out great sound!!!  i love these devices, no more searching for light switches!!"
9088,0,i really do not need more things to help the nsa record everything i say.
9089,8,love it!!!!!
9090,12,"it is got a bit of a learning curve, but i find new ways to use it each day. eventually i would like to have more smart home things to integrate with, but having it around is handy."
9091,9,i did not know i wanted one. much less how awesome it is. best surprise holiday gift from tech savvy family. i have used it every single day all day. fabulous! the only problem is it is not at work with me. might need to get another one...
9092,8,love it
9093,1,"the sound quality of the echo is very good,for such a small device. music is clear,crisp, an with definition. it is a really nice device."
9094,0,"not sure i had a real ""need"" for it, but it is nice to have.  will take some getting used to in order to find out optimal functionality.  what i do not like - no battery - must be plugged in at all times."
9095,12,lots of fun.
9096,10,"enjoying this very much, wish it had more music options"
9097,10,love my echo!  she spoils me.  i never have to get up and turn off or on lights and she has a sense of humor (that is the best part) and she understands my aging mom when she calls her alicia.  :)
9098,14,"need to turn down the tv a bit during commands, but otherwise just fine with the hue lights and tuya sockets!"
9099,14,i love how well the echo sounds! it is volume is louder than i expected. quality of sound is great! i had a bit of trouble getting alexa to connect to internet through the app. after about 10 mins i got it going. pretty easy after that.
9100,12,i am really happy with alexa
9101,11,"simply put, the audio is not as good as the original echo.  less full, less bass.  nothing than can be significantly improved with a software update.  the hardware, such as the original echo is bass reflex setup, is just not there.  plus, the volume ring is a feature on the original that i would sorely miss.  that being said, the new echo is still nice, if you cannot get a hold of the original."
9102,10,i love being able to listen to all kinds of music and also being able to work in the kitchen and have alexa make calls for me or look up recipes...give me a news brief and weather report....easy & time-saver!!
9103,14,the functions are amazing. the sound is unbelievably amazing!!!was very disappointed that i ordered my echo 2nd gerneration on january 25 and paid 99.99 for it and about a week later it went on sale and still is for 89.99. <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0095>
9104,10,i love it. playing all types of music. just have to ask alexia. excellent sound and volume. great price!!
9105,10,i love this ..what i love about it most is that i can talk to alexa and she has a answer to all my question....even of im unsure of what im asking she still understand ...this is one of the best gadgets made to date
9106,1,"really surprised by the clarity of the sound,it is in our kitchen we love it!!"
9107,10,so far so good - grandchildren love requesting songs and animal sounds!!
9108,0,"we like the sound and her quick response.  do not like that it does not have a battery, must keep it plugged in."
9109,10,this device is very responsive! i love it. it makes things gs easier. i often have alexa to make a to-do list or play certain music. it is great!!!
9110,1,it has amazing sound!!!
9111,3,wonderful. it works as expected. it is louder than expected. great response time.
9112,2,thanks
9113,10,"very easy to set up once i had the app downloaded.  enjoy the functionality, it understands my voice commands with out any issues.  really enjoy the trivia and weather updates at a drop of the voice."
9114,0,i like the echo. i still do not feel the functionality is where i would like it to be. i wish it was more integrated with the popular applications. also can someone please tell me how to make her play a video not just find them.
9115,11,great sound but not so good at hearing me.
9116,14,"while it started out working fine, but the last few days, there have been some issues. cutting off or going in and out.dropping game while playing."
9117,14,"i like the sound quality. there is no phone number for customer service. i would shop amazon more often if there was a customer service representative to interact with, especially when it comes to answering questions and set up of amazon devices."
9118,9,i love my echo! so happy i got this great gadget!
9119,8,this thing is amazing
9120,1,it dose sounds good with good amount of base. i use for background music in my living room.
9121,10,"this was a gift, and i love it.  i use it for so many different things every day such as making my grocery list, setting a timer, weather, word meanings, information etc."
9122,1,marvelous..
9123,0,she is great for adding grocery items to my shopping list but sometimes does not understand what i am saying. she is also not pleasant at times. she does not learn quickly.
9124,8,awesome
9125,12,still learning about everything alexa can do but we are very happy
9126,1,love the sound from this speaker.
9127,0,i love it mainly for music and during cooking. there are quite a few times it does not even know what you¡¯re saying and sometimes can not even find a popular song. but it has cool features and keeps the kids entertained so it gets 4 stars.
9128,1,great!
9129,14,once it was hooked up i fell in love. it is great to just say what you want from music to turning off a light. looking forward to a long relationship with alexia
9130,14,"speaker sounds way better than i expected for playing music.as far as alexa, it is handy for asking about weather, and to tell me how many cups are in a quart, etc."
9131,10,still exploring but i do love the music and also able to get some radio stations. love alexa
9132,1,the unit works fine.
9133,1,great product
9134,10,love it.  finding new things it does every day.  music on demand and controlling lights with voice is awesome.
9135,10,love the echo. such a great device.really enjoy being able to get updates without having to go search for a phone. the echo is a great assistant to have available at anytime
9136,0,i like that the speaker is loudi least like that it has to be plugged in to worki also dislike that i have to have a spotify account and not youtube.
9137,11,great sound quality out of the unit
9138,0,it is very helpful when i need information quickly. what do not like is that i can not get alexa to answer me when i say alexa
9139,14,sounds good and response correctly about 90% of the time. the more smart house items you purchase the more opportunities that opens up.
9140,9,we love our alexa!!!
9141,14,some features work well.  could not link to my nest thermostat
9142,0,i like asking her questions and that i can have the music that i like. some of her jokes are funny. when i tell her good morning i get a fact that happened on that day. very interesting.  this was a gift so still getting used to echo.
9143,10,fantastic!
9144,11,sound quality is better than expected
9145,14,was working fine for the first four months but now the manual volume does not work.  the only way to turn it up is to ask alexa to turn it up. not happy that i am having issues with this after such a short period of time.
9146,9,my oldest daughter in college found this to be a great asset! i¡¯m glad i invested great gift.
9147,14,"the search function is incredibly poor.  alexa only seems to be able to search wikipedia.  basic questions get very poor responses.  without any home automation or other functions connected, seems like we should have gotten google home."
9148,10,"we do not need to load up our cd player to hear all the music we enjoy over the years.  there are lots of other features such as the time, weather, news, reminders, alarm clock, etc.  simplyh great to have around the house."
9149,10,my family loves this product. my kid enjoys the jokes and my wife love to play music while cleaning or cooking.
9150,10,"great sound, easy to use.  nice to be hands free for various apps, i.e. pandora, streaming radio stations, etc."
9151,10,we absolutely love the echo in our home! even our toddler loves asking alexa to play music for him to dance to!
9152,9,"this is great, we bought it with the light bulb and it is very fun and good quality."
9153,10,really nice and they keep coming up with new uses
9154,0,works nicely. does not play some songs and it says that it is premium that you need to pay extra for
9155,11,great sound quality but specked more
9156,14,"false advertisement  says you can play amazon music, does not say you need to purchase amazon prime or amazon unlimited music."
9157,11,"love the sound, lime unit. dot sound ok but not great."
9158,10,"i enjoy the morning greeting, it is like having a friend.  the music is great too!"
9159,14,works great i have two they work good together of course you guys knew that. they work as one but there is two in different places.gary
9160,10,i love to tell alexa what to put on the shopping list. when i notice something i need i tell her and then check the app when i am at the store
9161,2,i love my echo!
9162,10,awesome.
9163,14,working ok alexa seems to not be able to gather some pretty basic data sometimes. sound quality ok. not as good as my sonos  system though
9164,11,"i love it. do not listen over a 7 volume, but it is really good quality sound for a decent size room. i love how it can pick my voice up across my apartment. i am still learning all of it is features but so far its great."
9165,14,my first gen device filters background noise better and has better voice recognition.  sound is better than gen 1.  need to move this unit to a different location to get value from it
9166,0,"i like that it works so well at any location if it is conected to an outlet!what i do not is, it does not work if i disconect it from wall outlet!it is wireless capable? forgive me if i do not know this or how to do it!"
9167,10,i love using it and so does my family. the sound quality for music is wonderful! it would make a great gift for  anyone. it even helps answer  social studies homework questions.
9168,10,"i love my echo, i work from home and enjoy having the ability to listen to music, get weather and news updates and even an occasional joke from the same unit! very happy with and see another unit in my future!"
9169,14,this thing is amazing. totally hooked on using it. its one of those things that makes you feel like you are living in the future. explore the alexa ¡®skills¡¯ you can add for free to give it extra functionality.
9170,12,"i love it, it does so many neat things and i have not even scratched the surface yet."
9171,14,i paired this up with klipsch promedia 2.1 computer speakersand wow .sounds great and the base wow.play songs from amazon music all day
9172,7,nice toys <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0080><f0><u+009f><u+0091><u+008d><f0><u+009f><u+0091><u+008d><f0><u+009f><u+0091><u+008d>
9173,0,"honestly pretty disappointed about this product, i just like the fact that i can tell her which music to play but besides that she almost always misinterpret what i say or is not up to date on the knowledge."
9174,10,i helps me with my appointment and helps with almost any questions she gives u an answer she plays music and will help with alot of question and she is so much fun my kids have a ball also
9175,0,"it is ok, found out it does not know that much. a lot of ""i do not know that!"""
9176,11,most improved to me is the audio out which was not available in previous version.
9177,10,"really good sound.  wish it worked with more apps.  right now we mostly use it for timers, reminders, alarms and music.  for these purposes it has been awesome."
9178,14,"purchased this for my grandparents who 75+ years of age and they are amazed. the only thing i would change, is the ability to change alexa is name.. at that age dentures will not allow you to fully pronounce all words. lol..."
9179,14,i was able to connect to my iphone hit spot for a week then could not so it had sat on a shelf for weeks unused and there is no wsy to reset it or anyone to help me connect to my phones hor spot. do not use it for that reason
9180,4,"i love my new echo!!!  alexa is so fun, the sound is great, and it is so easy to set up and use."
9181,14,we love the echo but a major downside is i do not have a usa based address and so voice purchasing and the opportunity to take part in special offers (such as the special subscription for music unlimited) is restricted.
9182,9,my family loves alexa so much i bought a dot too!
9183,1,"the speaker is amazing.  good clarity, and good base...room-filling sound."
9184,1,fast shipping and works great
9185,0,"volume is good.  product looks really good.  but overall performance for music in terms of user friendly, voice recognition, ease-of-use is not impressive at all. it has a long ways to go before it becomes a really good product."
9186,10,love the interaction with alexa.
9187,14,i love it and i also received the firestick and i¡¯m looking forward to getting the other companion products that match up with the echo.
9188,8,absolutely love it!
9189,5,bought for my daughter and she loves it!
9190,14,"great sound, great price. still working through a few kinks related to controlling the fire tv, but overall really outstanding. i wonder where verbal automation will be in the next 5 years... keep up the good work amazon!"
9191,10,love it!!  love that she makes my shopping list for me & it is right on my phone and not home on the kitchen counter!
9192,14,the echo is so easy to use. it responds frim a good distance away.
9193,1,speaker sounds good excellent quality
9194,9,"very impressed! we bought 4 of them for christmas gifts,...and my husband received one as a gift from my son. (it is on my nightstand)<f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+008a>using it a lot more than i thought i would.  sounds great too!!!"
9195,12,still trying to figure how to use it.
9196,10,what is not to love?!?  the list of skills is awesome and new things are continuously being added.
9197,14,"hate it, it is hard to figure out......need to download an app...is it on wifi....blah blah blah!"
9198,9,purchased as a present seems to be working great
9199,10,"excellent sound. love all of the features like calling, games, timer and music. playing categories is so much fun when people are over. also, keeps us off of our phones as frequently because when we have questions we just ¡°ask alexa¡±."
9200,8,love it
9201,14,delightful experience!  size is good - sound is outstanding.  loved the super bowl cheer for the eagles although i am a patriot is fan.news coverage is very good. i like its portability - be with me in the kitchen or study..
9202,4,fun fun fun ****(
9203,12,i am very pleased.
9204,10,"good buy , enjoy it every day ."
9205,10,easy set up and so much fun for our family. love it and all her skills!
9206,9,"my husband and i love it! it is really better than having a entertainment center, takes up no space at all and can give you more than just music"
9207,10,love this product. easy to set up and very friendly. all of friends and family are surprised on how easily i can control my entire house with alexa. .
9208,0,"it sounds great but it does not have many of the songs i ask for, i am a little disappointed with it !!  i joined the amazon unlimited music and it still is not very impressive !! thank you; linda gormley"
9209,10,"love my echo! i use it more for music but still answers most of my question, gives me accurate information and i know i can do a lot more with it. i definitely will buy a couple of more for all my rooms."
9210,4,easy to setup
9211,12,the sound is amazing. still learning all the things it can do
9212,10,"i just love alexa.  she is my new best friend.  i had to buy a second one for my sister and she is in love too.  would highly recommend, especially if you just want to hear any genre of music, any time of the gay or night."
9213,14,"outstanding. great fun and excellent sound. alexa ap somewhat difficult to navigate. will extract all features , eventually, of this unit. keep improving this product, potential unlimited."
9214,14,alexa is not only smart but she rocks had about 30 people over for new years and everyone download alexa app and played the music they wanted to hear good time
9215,4,it is fun and easy to use i recommend it to everyone
9216,10,"received as a gift.  great speaker sound. responds well to voice command. no problems so far.  is a novolty, good for weather reports and music.  i do not have house set up to use for light control etc."
9217,1,great item. fast delivery at a great deal. thanks again.
9218,8,love it.
9219,9,"i got this for my son who is in college. it is working out great he has his lights set up, his vacuum set up, and i get calls every day from alexa. best gift i¡¯ve ever gotten him!"
9220,3,the sound from the speaker is averagei was overall underwhelmed by it overall. i do no use it as much as i thought i wouldi would like it a bit more if it was wireless plugging it in makes it mess and cumbersome
9221,1,very good product. easy to use and setup. work perfectly with my spotify i recommend it.
9222,10,i love this product.  i like listening to my favorite music and setting up shopping lists.  i am eager to learn new things echo can do.
9223,1,the sound is pretty good and the volume is also good.
9224,0,"still learning how to work with her. not too good with electronics. but learning slowly,"
9225,2,love my echo!
9226,8,love it!
9227,1,the sound quality is very very good.
9228,11,i love it. i am a music buff and the sound quality is way better than i expected it to be. it is clear and crisp. alexa is voice does not sound robotic. it is sound is comparable to my bose 321. great job.
9229,14,"i now have three of these and they are great! perfect for the office, home, or anywhere you spend time."
9230,4,easy to connect.  great product.
9231,12,the echo is so much fun and it is great!  still lots more to learn!!
9232,1,good
9233,8,love it!
9234,14,"first let me say i generally love amazon and their products, but i am finding the echo just does not make the grade. i had high expectations - maybe too high, but i found their product description and advertisements for this product slightly misleading. while you can do the majority of what is suggested - you better have a lot more money and everything else you need to go along with it (live in a very urban area or major city, buy all the 'smart home' devices and hubs), which most additional devices is pretty pricey. i have been using this product for a couple of weeks, several times a day and more often than not i just end up frustrated. here is a list of pro is and con is i have made of my usage so far:pro is:- will give me some silly saying / fact if i tell it good night, or good morning- will tell me the latest national news if i turn on that skill- will work as a kitchen timer- sometimes will tell me what is on my calendar- has a ton of entertaining 'easter eggs'- will play music that i want to hear (is excellent as a speaker!)- will set multiple alarms, kind of... not the best at this though- can tell me a limited view of the current weather- can convert things (i.e. pounds = ounces, etc.)- can tell me dates of major events- will work as a reminder; ""alexa, remind me in 10 minutes to ______""- will finally give me repeating reminders - excellent to set a reminder for something at intervals, so glad they finally added this.con is: - often hears me incorrectly- sometimes just shuts off in the middle of me speaking a command- can not use the 'smart home' features without paying a lot of money to get set up (obviously)- can not use google to 'google' anything (can use bing or wikipedia searches)- when using 'skills' you must use often lengthy command sentences such as ""alexa, tell _________ skill to _______"" just to get it to access the skill and then there is usually a lengthy monologue you have to listen to each time.- has limited 'on board' skills (must use 3rd party skill system like apps for it to complete most tasks)- is not good at recognizing individual voices, even after voice training it- many of the skills are not usable in a rural area (uber, lyft, most radio stations)- can not give you local news if you are not in a major area- must have another system in each room to use it throughout your house, (can not detect your voice through thin walls) which you can do if you buy more echo is, dots, etc.- when trying to 'shop' by voice will give you the most expensive optioni have heard it is better than google home, cortana, and siri - but i do not know about that. most of the above listed functions in the 'pro is' list i can already do on my smart phone. i will say they say that they are working on making it better and at some point it might be better, but for now it is just very disappointing in my opinion. so before buying it, i would ask myself, can it do anything my smartphone can not? do not do like i did and get starry eyed with the wowing advertisements.update:i have had this product for over a month now and will say that customer support is excellent! it took them a bit they do now have recurring reminders which upped the potential of this being a practical device a lot. i still think it has lots of room for improvement, but i am able to use it and they are adding to it all the time, so i assume this will become a valuable device in the months to come."
9235,10,got it and after some effort we are operational. lots to learn. need to grow our knowledge of how stuff is done. thanks.
9236,0,i love it you can ask anything and get the answer you can preview any new album before buying it for your ipod or listen to your favorite artist without  buying it  it is great it is small but with a great sound i highly recommend it
9237,10,<u+00a0>love it love it! lazy mood on!
9238,8,love it
9239,14,i liked the first 21 days when it played almost any music i requested.  i didnt like what happened after 21 days when it has a limited selection.
9240,10,my family is a huge fan of alexa! this echo provides hours of entertainment for all of us.
9241,2,love it.  it knows everything!!
9242,8,love it!
9243,12,"i have had echo for about a week & love it! so much alexa does, i am still learning!"
9244,12,great stuff use every day
9245,10,"simple set up, love that i can get music at the sound of my voice. i¡¯ll invest in the one where it can turn off all the lights etc next. love my alexa"
9246,14,"we already owned an echo dot, purchased last year.  since we use it as a music player nearly 100% of the time, i jumped at the chance to try a unit with ""improved sound.""  is it true?  yes!  the 2nd generation echo has waaaay better sound than the original dot -- more even frequency response and dramatically improved bass.  i did not do a strict comparison but the amplifier in the echo likely has higher output, too, although the dot is able to play loudly enough for casual listening, with similar quality to a portable radio.  we normally pair the dot with external bluetooth speakers (or a bluetooth input on a full-size audio amplifier) for higher-quality sound.  this echo can stand on its own, in terms of quality, and does not need those externals to sound good.  we also have amazon music service, and were surprised to learn that the subscription is tied to the dot itself rather than to our household... extending it to the new echo costs extra money."
9247,14,this is a great device and i bought it at a great value.... had some minor difficulties getting it to recognize my voice but that may be an accent issue too....
9248,9,had an echo dot. bought this one because of the better speaker. really good sound from my music on prime and radio stations from tunein.
9249,4,"quick delivery, easy to set up!"
9250,14,this is my second echo. i have not been able to hear music. it continues to ask for a registration/subscription. i did not have this experience with my other echo. a real disappointment as that is the main reason for purchasing it.
9251,14,"kind of hard to get used to if you already use a bluetooth speaker like me. you simply can not just stream it from your phone, everything has to be associated with amazon which is hard for some."
9252,10,"echo is an excellent tool for hands free listening and access to information, audio programming, etc. as a speaker, it also provides excellent sound quality."
9253,14,i love the echo. i just wish this one was portable. it was working until today it started giving me delayed responses and kept ending my music without a cue from me. i hope this does not continue. otherwise it is great!
9254,8,absolutely loved it!!
9255,0,overall i really like it. dont like having to repeat myself sometimes and it does not always know the answers to my questions but its usually great and definitely makes life easier.
9256,10,love it! wish it came with a guide. would be a nice add on for newbies. this has changed my life!
9257,3,does everything they said it would. works well
9258,0,"i love it,,,but,,not recognizing my voice,,, blue light acts funny at times and dose not work,,hopefully it does not break and keeps getting smarter!!"
9259,9,awesome loving it
9260,9,what i like best is how well they sound for their size.
9261,8,love alexa
9262,0,what i dont like about it i cant hook it up to my smart cast vizio tv other than that it works great
9263,0,i like the look and the sound quality the most and what i dislike about it is that too often it does not understand what i am saying and i speak with proper grammar
9264,1,it is fun and informative.
9265,5,love it best christmas present ever.
9266,10,great
9267,14,nice add to my home network. cons: 1.echo has a limited database and does not provide answers to a number of my questions.
9268,10,love having alexa at my beck and call!
9269,9,when i first received it as a gift for christmas i was happy and a couple weeks after having it she just started going off on her own even if we do not call her...i¡¯m thinking she might have a lil glitch but other then that i love it
9270,0,"better than siri is all i can say.  i love my echo and never have a problem with alexa understanding me, best gift i have ever received."
9271,0,"great sound, sometimes needs several commands."
9272,14,it was very hard to connect and she would like to jump in and out from time to time. overall the volume is great and service is clear. i have not attempted to try any of the other stuff they say she can do.
9273,10,"i love my echo!  it has great dolby sound quality for playing my music.  everyone in the family interacts with it for news, sports and weather.  and the smart features are very helpful!"
9274,10,very useful in the kitchen for my wife when cooking.
9275,10,"love my echo. answers my questions, plays music, tells me jokes, etc,etc.. so much fun."
9276,14,if i could give a -10. i would!! i will not recommend this product!! do research anything. it does remembered anything it plays before!! so dissatisfied and disappointed!!
9277,11,i am really impressed with the sound quality of the speaker.  now i want to go replace all my echo dot is with this 2nd generation echo.
9278,10,alexa is so fun to play with. she does anything we ask her. totally worth it!!
9279,14,does not know the answers or have information about current or forthcoming events such as dates where ncaa basket ball tournaments will be held.
9280,0,i have to repeat myself a lot for it to understand me and i wish it could do a little more
9281,0,love the multiple music
9282,12,"we love our echo. the sound quality is great, and we almost always have music playing. the endless amount of things you can do with it, is truly amazing. only disappointing thing about it, is having to have it plugged in."
9283,1,love the sound quality. works great.
9284,11,"its okay.  i feel that adding new skills could be easier and more efficient.  the device itself is a 4, the app would be 2."
9285,9,i bought one for a friend at xmas and decided why not buy one for myself.  what a  great gift to give someone and myself.  i love it!  its the best present i ever bought my except for my car.
9286,10,love the echo. bought it for my husband cause he can not spell & i was tired of spelling for him. it was great. it can do so many things.
9287,11,moving over from the first generation echo. sound quality is massively improved. alexa is voice also has a lot more bass and is more lifelike. music through bluetooth or streaming is excellent. even at max volume the music is not distorted.
9288,9,"not something i would have bought for myself , xmas gift....but if u take the time to learn what it can do, cool gadget"
9289,8,love it
9290,14,i took advantage of the pre black friday deal.
9291,5,it was a gift. they were very happy
9292,10,love everything about this echo!  the sound is amazing and the things it can do amaze me on a daily basis.
9293,9,the speakers are amazing for something so small. and now my wife is jelly over my relationship with alexa.
9294,10,this little device changed our life forever. now we ask alexa for everything -  from current weather to entertaining our 2-year old.  and it does a very good job!
9295,14,"very easy to setup and use;  versital and -  hope is that more features will be added over time, work with more systems, etc."
9296,1,great sound. very entertaining and informative.
9297,14,great device but need younger person to figure out how to load all the apps and what to buy to make turning lights on and off easy.
9298,8,great item
9299,0,"we have enjoyed this a lot, especially when linked to our pandora stations.  i love asking it questions so i do not have to google it on my phone.  it is very sensitive with picking up your voice in another room"
9300,8,i love it works great.!!!!
9301,8,love alexa!
9302,1,excellent sound.
9303,14,"she is good, however she wakes at 2:00 am in the morning, reading the book and no one asked her too."
9304,0,best part about it is that it usually only recognizes my voice and not my fiance is. i am just happy to have one woman in my house that listens to me.
9305,10,use mainly for music it is great
9306,0,"music wise is the best , with prime music.. anything else ,just ask with detail ..sometimes she acts up..but i love it and sounds very nice! i am always listening to music"
9307,4,easy to install
9308,0,sound quality is great. i enjoy listening to my pandora on it and playing the games offered. i do not know what all she can do though. i know where to find the skills but apparently there is so much more she can do.
9309,0,"it should have some google intelligence added to it.  it is very disappointing to ask a question and alexa can not answer it.  it is especially frustrating to my husband, whom i bought it for as a gift for christmas."
9310,9,"my girl love her gift, great gift to give love ones"
9311,10,love to get updates on weather
9312,9,bought as a gift for my 92-year-old mother who is legally blind. she is enjoying the prime music and everything else the echo does. sound quality is great. better then expected. easy setup. great product!
9313,14,i love my new amazon echo. best money i have ever spent. i will be an amazon prime member to get amazon music plus all the other perks prime customers receive with membership. sound quality is perfect for my small condo.
9314,11,alexa is even better than i thought
9315,10,what i love the most is the music it was a little hard for me to set up because i¡¯m 70 years old but my grandson help me it is great for reminders for example to take pills it is so nice to have all of that music at your fingertips
9316,14,i can not believe we lived life without alexa! i am not a huge technology fan but this is worth it!
9317,11,definitely love this product
9318,10,i enjoy having the music etc in the bedroom and think i¡¯ll get another one for study.  there is nothing i do not like about it. just another layer of convenience and enjoyment.
9319,14,it is fine.  nothing special and after a couple of weeks i realized i have not talked to it for a while.
9320,14,the sound from the echo is terrific.  the dot was fine but this is finer.  love it!!!!  also love the songs that are available from amazon for the great price of $4.99/month.
9321,9,the echo is very handy and i¡¯m using it a lot more than i thought i would.  i might buy another one for another room of the house. i recommend it.
9322,0,"love how responsive to commands it is,, wish it were cordless"
9323,14,"i like it is sleek design along with the ability to change the color of the sleeve.  most importantly, i like the fact that it also doubles as a wireless bluetooth speaker.  oh!, and we can not forget about alexa, she is so polite."
9324,14,"i most like that you can say the lyrics of a song or a possible name and alexa finds it. i least like that alexa only recognizes certain products to turn on lights for example, so you have to go out and buy new products."
9325,0,"everything i ask alexa she says ¡° i do not know!¡±  ¡° you can go to the app for that¡±!  if i wanted to continually go to the app for every question, why would i spend money on alexa??"
9326,5,what a great christmas gift!
9327,4,easy to set up. great speaker
9328,0,does not work most of the time
9329,0,great machine.  like talking to a family member that knows when to go home. if you do not want to talk she will not. interesting what all she can pull up instantly. also she does not have all the worn out family history.
9330,0,it is advertised that it can do a bunch of different things but when you ask it to it says.... you can have this function if you pay for it. i was lead to believe its functions were free.  very limited free options.
9331,10,"i love echo. ask alexa to play music, weather, facts, and she responds immediately. one funny response when i thanked alexa was, ¡°that is what i¡¯m here for.¡±"
9332,14,gave to my daughter for christmaswhen they try setting it up it has all my information stored in it and they can not input their info. what can we do??
9333,4,"simple to set up, works as promised"
9334,9,"easy setup. i¡¯m enjoying this fun new gadget for my household. loved the black friday pricing, i should¡¯ve bought more."
9335,9,"fun, fun."
9336,8,excellent
9337,8,well worth it. i enjoy it daily.
9338,10,i bought this as a christmas gift for my mom to kind of bring her up with technology. she loves it and uses it to listen to music and ask cooking questions. very user friendly and i would recommend this to anyone!
9339,8,love it
9340,10,this is our second one and like asking question but mostly enjoying the music
9341,14,the audio quality is wonderful. but i cannot select spotify as default music device...
9342,4,great
9343,12,"amazing! easy to set up, easy to use. nothing about it, i do not like."
9344,14,has some problem understanding. but overall great..
9345,14,awesome product. synced without any issues to both my note 8 and iphone 8 plus. kids loving playing around with it. i can not wait to get some more for the house. thank you amazon for a truly fantastic product. keep it up.
9346,3,i enjoy this more than i thought i would.
9347,10,we use it everyday. my four year old gets a kick out of asking alexa to tell her jokes and play her favorite music! very helpful with debates with hubby or friends and also can track my amazon prime orders!!!
9348,0,would be a lot better if it were rechargeable. she gets confused with the news. a couple of other things that would add to the experience.
9349,8,love it!
9350,14,fun
9351,14,this product does not work in other countries except the us. this should be labelled accordingly in the product description before international buyers try to obtain it. google home is a better option in this case.
9352,1,"sound quality is awesome , love it !"
9353,9,"best purchase in a long time, loveit"
9354,0,i enjoy the ease of use and integration.  range of information that it can provide is pretty vast and very convenient.  the sound is pretty decent when listening to music via spotify
9355,10,"absolutely love our echo, loved the santa tracker for my kids around christmas. we do not get the full benefits because we do not have a smart home, but we use it daily, from checking the weather or setting timers and reminders....."
9356,2,love it!
9357,12,"clear, good sound, responsive to commands. still finding out how we can use it."
9358,4,ease of setup and use! fun!
9359,14,great sound!! does not always contact to our phones correctly or play the music through pandora/amazon correctly. think connection is usually our problem...
9360,9,"worked very well, my husband  likes to listen to old music and it is great for him. i have only used it a few times but am very happy with it."
9361,9,i bought this for my boyfriend for christmas and he loved it.  sound is even better than mine from last year.
9362,0,can let you know about weather and listening to music. very picky sometimes.
9363,0,love it. only wish it could recognize and play music from my itunes.
9364,11,sound adjustments of bass and trebble are missing. sound is too bassed
9365,14,"its just alot more useful then you would think, and with amazon music unlimited, only being 3 dollars a month if you have an echo its worth it ,you can also stream amazon music on your phone in the car ,or wherever"
9366,14,excitement
9367,9,love it!!!
9368,10,kids love it and we appreciate the music
9369,11,sound is very good and a nice compliment to the dot. good size - not too tall.
9370,1,sound is great
9371,14,"excelent product!without having experienced any other similar product, and using it only, to listen music, echo met my expectations."
9372,14,awesome! use my echo daily! great price but if you really need high level audio and do not have a system to bluetooth into get the sonos one for twice the price
9373,10,"love the convenience of asking for flash briefing, weather, music ect"
9374,4,sound quality is good. easy installation. amazing device.
9375,0,very helpful when calling to set it up  wish i had more information on what i can do  the manual is limited
9376,1,"sound is great very crisp and clear. also very powerful, i love it."
9377,9,i thought about getting one for a long time and i finally did so happy with it i recently bought the 2nd generation dot for my bedroom and i love it as well!!
9378,2,i love echo!  my 2nd one!
9379,8,love it.
9380,14,"all i can say is wow. one reason i bought this is i am going blind, so alexa will be reading to me."
9381,1,great product.
9382,14,work as well as my echo but no screen.light is not as noticeable.
9383,14,great sound!  i have echo spot and this is 1000% better!
9384,9,"bought it as a gift for myself after christmas. love it more than i thought i could. sound is clear, music sounds great. i play my pandora."
9385,3,love it.  item as described
9386,14,it goes off with out me saying anything. i have to say alexa like 5 times in order for it to actually listen. has issues linking up with other echo compatible devices. maybe the one i got is defective?
9387,12,love my echo. use it more and more everyday
9388,12,great sound. so much fun to have.
9389,11,update makes it sound way better.
9390,14,the sound was great and it was easy to set up with assistance from help line!
9391,0,"being able to get info fast.  what i do not like is that alexa does not know where i live we have programmed her several times and she still things she lives in marysville, ohio"
9392,0,i like it very much.
9393,14,amazon echo 2 generation too amazing sound when i do listening so i thought i have to buy echo plus too i may be this summer. i still hope without tapping to requesting the next update for echo 2.
9394,14,it does everything expected. i am hoping for some updates that compete with the google device that will read me a recipe.
9395,0,it answers simple things like weather. does not have many music choices with amazon prime and is not user friendly with pandora.
9396,7,i love it! the echo alexa features are really user friendly. the tips <f0><u+009d><u+0091><u+00a8><f0><u+009d><u+0092><u+008e><f0><u+009d><u+0092><u+0082><f0><u+009d><u+0092><u+009b><f0><u+009d><u+0092><u+0090><f0><u+009d><u+0092><u+008f> sends you are also very helpful. perfect device for listening to music. can not wait to start adding some of the home controlled devices.
9397,0,"it is fun to play with, but so far i have not found it too useful. maybe as i learn to use it and add skills. it is nice for streaming pandora."
9398,9,awesome. everyone should own one. just too cool and fun!
9399,10,"alexa is a dream, there are so many things you can do with her.  she answers questions, plays games and music.  i do not know what we did without her!"
9400,0,"the sound is great. however, it keeps turning off by itself. today it kept saying: can not play right now, come back later........"
9401,8,simply awesome!!
9402,14,gets even better with time
9403,2,alexa is literally my new best friend!! i love her
9404,0,ease of use and in linking up to system.  works really well. only complaint is that you can not name it what you want.
9405,14,"i love it!! what can i say, respond quickly and efficiently of course if there is something alexa does not know, she will tell you..lol.. listening to smooth jazz is a treat!! the bass can be felt in my desk chair."
9406,0,works pretty well.  it takes a little while to learn how to speak alexa so that she will understand exactly what you are asking.
9407,0,"i did not like anything about it. it did not meet my desired requirements.. sometimes would would, sometimes would not work.. very frustrating!!!"
9408,1,amazing amazing product. alexa is very helpful in my smart home.
9409,10,"amazing sound, extremely useful....makes me want everything in my house connected to alexa"
9410,10,i love my echo (2nd generation).  alexa works like a dream and there is so much more alexa can do that every day is a learning experience. thanks amazon.
9411,8,love this gadget!
9412,11,"no hands operation, voice control is the best!"
9413,9,great gift. love the way it simplifies my life.
9414,8,its awesome i use it everyday
9415,8,love it
9416,9,"i never thought i would like having an echo in the house, but my sister and brother in law bought it for us as a house warming gift andwe really love it."
9417,1,great product..great sound...love alexa
9418,14,so glad to have this in the home.  plan on adding a few more to the home.
9419,8,love it!
9420,0,really loved the sleek look of the product. a little disappointed with alexa. it is difficult to get alexa to understand what you¡¯re saying. constantly having to repeat myself.
9421,12,having so much fun with this
9422,14,"works well with the other echo products and integrated flawlessly. speaker quality appears similar to 1st generation, despite the claim. overall statisfy!"
9423,12,love alexa! still learning all that we can do with her!
9424,14,"music - of every decade, style, that you possibly want."
9425,11,sound quality after the firmware update adjustments greatly improved. much better than first gen echo but in a more compact sizeand at a bargain price.
9426,0,"it is great and very responsive but when speaking to it in spanish it does not get a single word, plus i wish for it to be able to sync with apple music instead of using pandora, soundcloud and etc."
9427,14,"echo requires a mobile app or computer for installation. without a smart phone, and with only a chromebook, you are out of luck."
9428,8,love it
9429,14,i really enjoy the amazon echo. i am working on setting it up to be able to run things in my home. high quality speaker. would say learning how to ask questions is the only difficult thing about it.
9430,0,"when we alexia a question on current events, it does not have an answer.  so far very disappointed in the performance of this product.  does not have the anywhere near the search engine capability of basic google."
9431,10,i love my alexa is. especially the feature play everywhere.
9432,0,it is everything i dreamed of! i most definitely recommend using amazon music with it because you can ask it to play almost any song and it will! i am very pleased and i love the color! the volume and bass are amazing!
9433,12,we are still getting used to alexa but so far i am very impressed with what she can do.  certainly a good value for the cost.
9434,1,the sound quality is great .
9435,11,worth getting this one over the echo dot. speakers are way better more volume. excellent product.
9436,1,excellent music quality
9437,0,fun to use.  some music selections not available without a subscription to amazon tunes. this is annoying!
9438,0,"very helpful, but also fun to use. no problems or negative opinions"
9439,14,"i love the amazon echo 2nd gen. it can do just about anything i ask. it plays all of my favorite songs, but it lacks only a couple songs i have asked to play, which all in all, is not a bad thing at all."
9440,0,she seems to never have answers to any of our questions! siri is much smarter ;)
9441,14,"i love it,  makes a great addition to my home  network.  very easy setup and when used with the phillips hue lighting system it makes it even better!"
9442,14,fantastic audio n it is like being mr spock talking to the starship enterprise computer- sci-fi artificial intel is here with alexa.  love it
9443,0,pretty neat. i like to wake up every morning and ask ¡°what time is it?¡± connects bt to my phone but i wish i knew how to do more with it. other then that it is a great device to have!
9444,14,it has been hard to train and i am disappointed in that it has a hard time giving correct answers. i bought one for each person in my real estate office thinking it was a great idea!
9445,8,love it
9446,10,i love this product! it is amazing what it can do. and so easy to operate!
9447,14,yes
9448,10,it makes life so easy. it is automating down to the smallest tasks
9449,8,i love alexa!!!!!!!
9450,10,"we love alexa. music, weather, movies. super bowl information! orders! endless!! we are still learning!"
9451,1,great price and sound.
9452,14,love this product. listen to music from my iphone or amazon music. the sound is great. have also used it as a speaker for my audio books. very happy customer.
9453,11,i like this much more the dot.  better speakers.
9454,10,"i mainly use it for traffic, weather and playing music to sleep."
9455,9,yes. very good. enjoying it as well as the first echo purchased. have one in the den and one in the bedroom.
9456,9,"this was my second echo i have one in the kitchen one in the lr working on getting more smart lights,switches, ect"
9457,8,love it! sounds great!!
9458,8,love alexa!  great product
9459,14,i¡¯m impressed that they have really good sound good for you if you live on apartment
9460,14,after amazon exchanged a defective one with this one everything is better than expected.
9461,9,very good
9462,4,very easy to set up easy to use also very helpful i would definitely recommend this to everyone
9463,10,we are enjoying have information just a question away.
9464,10,we are really enjoying this addition to our lives!
9465,14,i like the echo because it plays what i want to hear. the worst thing about it is that i had  difficult time connecting to my wi-fi.
9466,0,"most of the time she tells me ""i am sorry, i am having trouble understanding right now.  please try later.""  it is really aggravating, so i find i do not use her as often as i would."
9467,0,my alexa is awesome . she plays what i ask her to most of the time . the only thing that i would change is when you ask her to play am artists first album . she does not seem to understand that .
9468,9,"i love my echo. it was a christmas present and although i use it less than i would like, it does absolutely everything i want it to! good, clear sound, understands all my commands and the app is easy to use. love it!"
9469,14,great when it stayed connected. disconnects often and it sets right beside my router. constantly drops connection. very  irritating so i do not use that much anymore.
9470,11,would be 5 stars but i miss the rotating top volume adjusting ring on the older models  it was handy for quickly adjusting the volume manually.
9471,9,"this is just an amazing thing, i talk to alexa more than my wife lol, great product thanks"
9472,10,"the most i like about my amazon product is waking up having a cup op coffee discussing the day and news of the day, its like having a clean smart room mate that says thank you, and guides me through the day , i absolutely  like"
9473,14,our echo was a christmas gift and after about 2 weeks the low frequency bass sound starting distorting like the speaker is damaged.  not sure of the cause but will need to return this for repair/replacement.
9474,14,"actually a great speaker!  not as smart as google in terms of random questions, but perfect for playing music and adding things to my cart."
9475,12,i am enjoying it daily. i have not been able to use all of the options yet.
9476,0,fun to use.  too many extras that cost money to really make it worthwhile. some extras should be included.
9477,14,can not open the app on my ios. might have to send back if i can not access the app.
9478,12,do not use it much.
9479,5,mother in law and sister in law love them
9480,14,awesome!!! it is all already been said and is all true. great sound and awesome device. i have it paired with amazon unlimited music and it is pretty terrific.
9481,11,the sound quality is not as good as i thought it would be. on the fence about this purchase.
9482,14,really like that alexa knows everything .  had to call customer support to get help to get echo hooked up to wifi.
9483,11,"definitely like the 2nd generation over the 1st generation, better sound quality.  this is smaller than the 1st edition, the plus is about the same size and shape as the 1st generation"
9484,10,love how easy it is to set alarm and timer.  i use it in my bedroom so i can fall asleep to music.  if volume turns out to be too loud alexa will adjust with my request.
9485,10,"it is everything and more than i thought it would be.  i love that alexa starts my day with ""news briefing"" and ""local weather report"" daily.  there is nothing i do not  like about my echo and dot.  love my ai."
9486,9,"enjoying the sound quality, and having a lot of fun with friends."
9487,3,works just as i would hoped :-)
9488,8,loving it.
9489,11,pros -smaller and somewhat better sound. con- preferred the volume ring on gen 1 as opposed to the 2nd gen + - button
9490,14,"quality sound, serious upgrade from echo. music selection pretty limited without subscription."
9491,10,works great and easy to set up. now we want more!
9492,14,yes it is working well
9493,10,the best device i¡¯ve ever had. eco is my bff now. highly recommend this device. each home should have one of this. super smart and take all kinds of accents.
9494,10,"we really enjoy having the echo and alexa in our home!  we play jeopardy, she keeps my lists for shopping, to do is, etc.  i know the weather before i head out for the day and i can have any kind of music i desire!  love it!"
9495,0,"i expected more out of it. an occasional answer to a question would be nice. an answer besides ""i can not answer that at this time"" would be great. so i have gone back to using siri for quicker more accurate answers."
9496,1,awesome speaker. sometimes laughs creepily but a solid smart speaker
9497,5,it was a gift
9498,8,love it
9499,9,it is great!
9500,1,perfect device for my kitchen!
9501,9,there is nothing i do not like about my echo. i was given a gift certificate for christmas and this was my choice to purchase. i am very happy with it!
9502,10,"easy to set up and use.  get a daily ""laugh"" from alexa is corny jokes.  great weather info.  really love it!"
9503,14,have two echos and love them! great if you have prime because you can listen to music along with the many other functions!
9504,14,sounds are great!  lacking documentation and instructions on how to use it. product manager should take to a focus group and get feedback.
9505,14,does not play music on both echo is at the same time.........i thought it would.
9506,14,pretty good. has limits i did not expect. still learning and exploring.
9507,0,i really enjoy my echo.  i do have to remember that alexa takes requests to literal so i have had to learn to ask for exactly what i want.
9508,4,fun and easy to use.
9509,9,i mostly ask alexa to play music before bed and when i wake up in the mornings - this unit delivers excellent sound. plus at this low price i am considering a second one for my downstairs studio.
9510,10,"echo has exceeded my expectations. can play games with it as well as listen to all music genres, get time and weather, and listen to it is corny jokes! fun."
9511,12,i love it but have a lot to learn about how to use it more fully.
9512,11,simply the best and now i want the new dolby version!!!!!
9513,14,"i really like the design, much nicer. looks good on my counter. does not answer a lot of questions but that might be something to do with the setup. i do not have an account. we got it as a gift."
9514,14,great voice recognition capability.  performs numerous helpful tasks. great addition to helping automate my home.
9515,5,super fast delivery. sister inlaw loved it.
9516,1,works great
9517,14,has very nice sound for its size.  i have echo and sonos and wanted them to play nice together and that does not happen.  they both would benefit from this ability.
9518,5,aok
9519,1,this is a nice product
9520,0,"love this for timers, alarms and for a dictionary. still have not figured out everything it does but it is a fun tool."
9521,0,the speakers on it are amazing and it can get very loud. sometimes it does not hear perfectly which can get annoying. also it has to stay plugged in all the time and is not very portable. other than that i would recommend!
9522,10,"a very cool gadget. fun, games, facts. controls all wi-fi in the house. works as whole house intercom with echo."
9523,0,easy for listening to music. need to use it more to figure out all the features. sometimes hard to understand me
9524,1,great sound! works great.
9525,11,"i liked the music feature the most. to much bass in the voice, i liked the least"
9526,14,i guess i had higher expectations and am glad i got it on sale. alexa is not really that smart
9527,14,"quality sound, smaller size and easy installation. recommend it as an initial purchase. it has far more functionality than i will utilize as i am retired and have no intention of automating my apartment with other devices."
9528,0,i love alexa but i¡¯m slightly disappointed in the song selection of her memory. most of the songs i ask her to play in bluetooth mode is not available she only would offer a ¡°preview ¡° of the song which sucks
9529,14,connecting with my earlier version in a separate floor of my home is awesome!!
9530,1,an amazing little device.  sound quality is just lovely.  great product.
9531,10,absolutely love this device. i spend a lot of time in the kitchen. it has great sound and having voice control is great.
9532,14,"still exploring the capabilities but it is definitely ""the future"" - excited to start to get connected with other items in the house (time to purchase some!),"
9533,1,it is an amazing piece of technology .
9534,12,love it. still learning what it can do.
9535,0,bought this for my lady and she absolutely loves it! i still think the government is listening tho haha... overall it is a really good device
9536,8,love it!
9537,10,my husband is in an electric wheelchair & not able to do many things but he is able to use echo & he really enjoys the device. it helps to entertain & keep him occupied for great lengths of time
9538,5,got this as a gift. love it!
9539,0,i enjoy the variety of music i can request.i do not like having to pay for that cloud option.
9540,3,does everything it says as more!
9541,10,this a wonderful device. very convenient and my kids love the jokes and games. convenient while moving around the house and she picks up your voice very well. i highly recommend
9542,0,we love it but it turns off out of no where and when we ask alexa something she says that she cannot find it. she worked very good in the beginning but now she is not working as before
9543,4,so awesome to use!
9544,14,"some days she is flawless and others, she spin without responding to commands. love the sound from the speakers"
9545,0,"i really like it!  it plays the songs you tell it to  play. i can tell her to give me the weather forecast, and she does. it is a great thing to have."
9546,5,the best gift i received. i love it i use it everyday. my friend jane outdid herself with this gift and i hope you will try it and love it as much as i do.
9547,3,everyone will say this is a life changer....love it
9548,14,exactly what i was not expecting. this thing has changed my daily routine for the better.
9549,2,i love my alexa!
9550,1,awesome product!
9551,2,the best!!!! love it!!!
9552,10,"the sound of the speaker is very good especially for the size, i get weather stock and news updates very fast, the hands-free part is so nice when you are doing things in the kitchen and need some information"
9553,10,alexa is voice is soft and clear.  it is taking me time to relinquish my habits of finding all i want on my computer.  good for music.
9554,0,"i love playing jeopardy with this.  but music seems limited, wish i could play my mp3 is through it."
9555,14,given as a gift but was far too difficult for us ¡°older people¡± to operate.  the gift was returned.
9556,10,great sound system to listen to music. enjoy getting my daily news briefing i set up each morning. use the timer feature when cooking doing laundry etc. i need to use alexa more have not tried more things she is capable of.
9557,11,so much better sound than first gen
9558,0,nice having a new toy. givers great information and plays all the music i need.only problem is i live in one city and it does not recognize it. always gives weather for an adjoining city.
9559,0,given to us as a gift but if you do not have compatible devices there is no reason for this
9560,14,"i am very happy with my ech9, however, it can become frustrating when trying to get it to read particular pages from my kindle. but, i am still learning."
9561,11,sound quality is vastly improved over the 1st generation echo
9562,11,the sound is fabulous!  i also have an echo dot and having stereo in my house is awesome!
9563,1,excellent sound and alexa is knowleadgable
9564,14,"pros:it is small (more compact than i was expecting)alexa works great! (same as the echo dot) she is basically my new best friend!they are adding more and more things every day to what she is capable of doingreally love using it with smart home devices (christmas tree lights, lamps, thermostat, patio light etc)saves me so much time (alexa set an alarm, whats the weather, wake me up, tell me the news, i ask what time it is 10xs a day)cons:only 1. i was using a dot and had it connected to my big jam box via bluetooth but if i did not use it all day i would find that the connection would unpair every day by the end of the night, this annoyed the living crap out of me so that is why i bought the echo as it has it is own speaker.  the dot alone i could never hear but thats the model that roped me in so to say.  so the big negative of the echo is that the speaker really plain ol just stinks. my big jam box is just a tad bit bigger but wow the difference in the quality and richness of the audio is night and day difference. my suggestion to amazon is to add another version of the echo, call it the echo pro or echo audiophile. i would pay $100 more for a better and louder speaker. if you are not that into music it might not bother you too much, but for me, who has a big jam box in 1 room and a bose in another room, this just sounds pitiful in comparison. it distorts at level 10, level 9 is not the max level that i would like a speaker to have.  there is zero bass, too much mids, and not enough treble surprisingly enough. you can really clearly tell that the speaker just does not cut it, i do not think people would mind a larger unit if that meant a more enjoyable higher end user experience. like i said if giving it a bigger better sound adds to the price-point, then i would not mind laying down a little more dough for the model up version. i can see people enjoying this model just fine also as long as their expectations in sound quality are so high.conclusion:it is a great little device but it needs to have a bigger speaker that is more powerful with a bold rich sound to it, fix that and i would think that every person on the planet should have one of these.note: this is my opinion and based off of having already upgraded to the latest firmware sound fix. i will upgrade my stars should it ever get near the quality of my big jambox or bose."
9565,11,"i like the new compact  size, and the updated sound."
9566,12,fun to have
9567,0,i love it
9568,10,a delightful christmas surprise. she knows my favorite songs! and we are getting better at jeopardy.
9569,3,more betta alexa
9570,0,love this product. have most smart devices connected to her and can control everything with voice commands. and even better i can tell alexa to play whatever i want to watch on tv. how did i live without her?
9571,9,did what i bought it for!!
9572,8,love it!
9573,10,"i love my echo dot! i love the weather, music and other features. amazon is good about sending updates on new functions. i am still learning all it can do. i wish it played all songs for free is the only downside!"
9574,14,"the sound is great. love that i can use other music services like iheartradio, although amazon music is not too bad either. i also like the smart home integration. overall, very happy."
9575,14,love it!!! works great and my kids love it. however i wish it had a rechargeable battery in it so i could move it to a different location for a short period of time where there is no outlets.
9576,3,great product
9577,11,"imho, the speaker and its wifi reception is not as good the first generation echo."
9578,12,"for one speaker, the sound is really good.  lots of capabilities - we are still learning and only use a limited amount. prompt delivery."
9579,12,love  this echo.does so much stuff.
9580,1,great
9581,14,"first the bad news---setting it up is challenging!  the good news---love it!!!  sound quality and amplification are better than we predicted.  in the short time we have had it, we have really enjoyed it!"
9582,14,"overall, i am happy with the device.  however, when asking a question that alexa does not know or a service not available, a suggestion would be greatly appreciated on what to link to to get the result."
9583,10,the echo is such a time saver. it took me a few days to get used to not having to run to my phone or mack book every time i needed information. now all i do is ask alexa. my whole family uses the echo.
9584,8,great!
9585,5,was a gift and they really like it
9586,14,"love it and i will say that i am very happy that i did not listen to those negative reviews. some people are just so negative and picky. also keep in mind that these are not $500 perfect speakers. these are very good speakers that are splendid and do an excellent job for what they are meant to do.if you want to run expensive speakers then buy the dot and bluetooth connect them.if you want to save money and absolutely enjoy a solid speaker then these new 2nd gen speakers are excellent, especially if you buy a 3 pack (while the special is still running).and yes, i do own an extreme sound system for my music and movies that has around 3000 watts, 3 (800 watt subs), a 1500 watt center speaker, 4 rear speakers and 2 tower speakers. complete overkill. so..., do i know good sound?! yes!that is why i rate these small cylinder speakers excellent for what they do, which is a lot!the music is clear and concise, meaning not muddled, and alexa is voice is strong but not overbearing, but very pleasant.most times i am asking for the volume down as i do not need it any louder.we mostly use alexa for instant information, room filling music, news, and book reading.we have these around the house for instant exercise music, relaxation music and we use the room to room speakers for an intercom system which works excellent!!!we also love making group of speakers play the same thing in a certain area which sounds awesome!we use it for recipes too! and we love how quick alexa is!even on loud volume everything is clear, including using the drop in intercom system and when someone is talking too loud it does not disrupt the speaker. it is absolutely clear. our teenage daughter has an issue with shouting into the mic. uh we hear you sweetie. lolall in all, again it is sad that there are so many negative people that love to be negative.on a scale of 1-10, for the money, these are around a 9 with 10 being perfect and there are not many perfect things in this world except the perception of perfection, which amazon has done a darn good close replica of that word!!!! thank you amazon!!!and yes, i paid with my own money for all of the speakers, amazon did not give me any money or deals to write this. i honestly was just mad at the negative reviews. ;-)enjoy!!!"
9587,0,i enjoy using it for music and news however most questions i ask can not answer. i was unhappy it does not control my smart tv like i thought it would.
9588,10,i like that all my favorite music can be played within seconds of my thinking of it.  i can ask what my schedule is and what the weather is like as i eat breakfast.  i have a lot to learn about the other abilities of alexa.
9589,0,"makes listening to music and getting the weather forecast so easy.  there is probably a lot besides asking alexa questions like turning on the tv, but i do not know how to do any of it.what is product link?"
9590,5,bought this for my 94 year old mom for xmas. she loves it!
9591,10,"love being able to ask for music, sound is great and adjusting volume.  love that i can make shopping lists and then it is on my phone at store.  thanks for the reminders of other things alexa will do."
9592,4,great product.  easy setup and easy to use!
9593,5,inc was a gift.
9594,0,it does not do what the ad says it do
9595,1,finally got an alexa and love it. it works every time and is perfect for the kitchen. it looks good too :)
9596,0,so far we love alexa! got it for christmas so still trying to learn what all it does. it has gone off a couple of times on its on but other than that no problems!
9597,14,it came packaged and exactly as described. had problems with my first order (got lost) but problem was immediately rectified.
9598,4,great quality!
9599,2,love my alexa
9600,0,hesitant to review as i have not utilized it extensively. great sound for music playlists.  not a technology person.  but am enjoying the music and random questions answered.  will use more as i learn more.
9601,0,so far i like everything just have not learned what it will do. it would be nice if directions came with it. since a lot of senior people are not computer savvy. it is taking me a lot of time to figure it out
9602,8,it works great.
9603,10,love my echo!! do not know how i lived my life with out her!!
9604,0,wish this was more interactive.  of course that means it would cost a ton more!
9605,8,love it
9606,10,"love it! still becoming familiar with all the skills.  i have mostly been using it to check weather, leave myself reminders and turn on and off lights, as well as listening to music. decided one is not enough, so i bought a second."
9607,1,"love alexa. the sound is great, the shipping was fast!!!!!"
9608,14,"good sound, alexa knows a lot."
9609,14,what i really like about the echo is the sound and clarity when playing music. alexa is super responsive to questions and commands. it is working quite seamlessly with other enabled devices in my house.
9610,14,"overall happy with it, but it definitely has some bugs to it. i get some random commands delivered when i have not even asked it."
9611,11,"great sound, durable, stylish and smart! i mean, it is alexa!  i wish it had a battery for portability but overall a great speaker and terrific value."
9612,8,great product
9613,10,i recommend it. keep up with its updates and you can continue to use it in new ways. i love the shopping list feature. you can see the list on your phone at the store. so i love my alexa in my kitchen/living room
9614,4,"great, very smart and fun to use"
9615,14,love it now to get the add ons for the house
9616,9,too much fun!!!  our whole family loves it!!!  we are learning a lot!
9617,14,great sound from this small speaker but can get some distortion with songs having more bass. integration with smartthings seems flawless as with my other echo dots.
9618,4,very hard to setup.
9619,14,"the sound is amazing and works amazingly with smart devices like plugs, thermostats, and front door cameras. everything was shipped perfect and it works smoothly."
9620,10,i love this echo. it plays all my music and answers my questions professionally. excellent product.
9621,10,"i love my echo.  she is not so great yet at playing 20 questions (my parrot is better at it), but she is learning."
9622,1,love the speaker quality & simplicity of use!
9623,10,"excellent! echo sound is clear, the device responds very well, we have found echo and of course alexa to be a wonderful compliment to our household."
9624,12,this fabric echo is actually pretty! love everything about it.
9625,9,great gift that i got at christmas
9626,14,got echo as a gift.  use it mostly for music.  fairly good sound.  like the tips and ideas emails.
9627,10,always a pleasure to use one of them.
9628,14,"this device is amazing, do not understand why i waited so long to get one - very happy with it, out of the box and functioning flawlessly in minutes."
9629,14,i like that it has voice controls.  wish it would pair with music on my phone. good speaker. sometimes it seems to turn itself on.
9630,11,sounds great. it would even be better if it also had bluetooth
9631,11,"love it, works as stated. worth the price compared to the echo dot."
9632,0,"i like the fact that you can ask it questions and it usually has the answers.  i am not thrilled with it because it does not have a lot of the songs i request, which is the main reason my husband bought it."
9633,9,it was a gift and the person l bought it for loves it. the sound is very clear.
9634,10,"i love this. .. especially the wide variety of commercial free music. i am sure that i will not be using every feature,  but i really appreciate the weekly emails telling me about new and existing features to try."
9635,0,alexa was very easy to activate. especially like the find my phone. speakers are great. we use it a lot. still learning how to use her. great buy
9636,0,great device sometimes difficult with understanding but overall great
9637,14,"great sound.  when you ask it to play a song you should ask to play it from spotify the first time you ask or you will have to ask again more times than you want to.  good for a news ""flash briefing"".  every flash briefing is from fox news and includes the words...  i do not use it to turn lights off and on.  it is no good for sports and will not give you a point spread no matter how many times you ask.  if you already have spotify and you can turn off your own lights...i am sorry i spent the $99.  they have obviously made this with a lot of flaws so you have to buy the newer version in 2018.  i only buy products with 5 star ratings  from amazon so i have never had to write a one star review before...this is my first time.  sports news is not available at the moment.  if you think you would love hearing that 4/5 times a day, alexa is for you!"
9638,14,"worst purchase of my life, the echo has been nothing but frustration since i took it out of the box.i wanted to use it at work, a university with strong 802.11 b wireless coverage. the echo says it works with 802.11 b networks. i bought the echo, because i have no reason to think it will not work. as soon as i try to set it up, the device is unable to connect to the university is wifi. i spend time trying to figure it out myself, and i am unable to. so i finally call customer service, and have one of the most abysmal customer service experiences imaginable. the first representative is rude, clearly lacks knowledge about the product, and transfers me to the returns department. so clearly they just want me to return the device? i talk to the woman at returns, and realizing whats happened, ask to speak to a manager. the manager does nothing but offer to transfer me to tech support. while i wait for tech support to come onto the phone (33 minutes and counting) i am writing this review.do not waste your time by buying this useless product. amazon does not care about it is products, and it does not care about its customers."
9639,14,"very intuitive and user friendly. totally worth it. even my 2 yr uses it to scream ""alexa-play moanna"" and it recognizes her voice. subtle observation but cool nonetheless...buying another one for multi-room use."
9640,5,"it was a gift to my sister, and she seems to love it!"
9641,0,very cool device to connect with home lighting.sometimes its a bit difficult remembering the exact terminology to get alexa to do certain things.
9642,14,"compared to friends that have echos and dots,mine seems to have some malfunctions .. for example, it never can understand what i¡¯m telling it,along with a lack of song selection and my drop ins do not sound clear either ..."
9643,12,excellent item for every home - outstanding sound quality - just learning its many uses
9644,14,awesome.  i really like controlling my lights and thermostat via voice command.  would like an app for vizio tv though.
9645,8,love it!
9646,14,"i want to add other items that work with the echo, light controls, echo dot, and thermostat controls."
9647,14,not worth it. i bought and used for 2 weeks and never feel the urge to use it again. i can better search and het the exact songs i want. it still needs to improve a lot before being used in mass
9648,10,love it! music in my kitchen! love the ability to make a list for shopping and hands free calling.
9649,0,"fun to use.some answers or lack there of are because of political correctness.  for example ""what is the population of south africa by race/ethnicity.""""the population is very diverse"""
9650,10,it is so handy in answering various questions. love the aspect of being able to call through echo and speak to family members. just plain fun to have around.
9651,9,they are awesome and loud love it
9652,3,works great just like advertised.
9653,10,not for me...
9654,9,"love this, will buy another one for our second home"
9655,0,"we love the echo!! it is sensitive to pick up the name, and it plays exactly what ask."
9656,0,as expected. do wish it would keep its attention on the conversation instead of continually having to say alexa then the question
9657,12,we love our echo and use it all of the time.
9658,5,graduation gift for my son.  he loved it.  adding new apps to it everyday
9659,14,"i love this product. i bought it during the black friday sale, and i could not be happier. this is my fist smart home related device and it works perfectly. i love how it is coopatitble with my tp link plug"
9660,10,i like the speaker sound  and she knows the weather and find anything in the internet
9661,10,"i just love it, weather, fun facts and music. just had to have it."
9662,10,"love the echo 2nd generation.  music is great. shopping list, everything."
9663,14,"what a cool device.  the sound goes through the house like old school speakers.  wish it could automatically connect to slacker. until then, i just play slacker on another and bluetooth the sound to echo."
9664,10,excellent addition to the entertainment room. easy to set up and start using it. all sorts of fun and educational games for kids. buyers remorse free!
9665,14,"bought this echo new (not refurbished). about a week in, i opened up my ipad (which was now linked to the echo) to amazon.com to shop and a stranger from a completely different state was logged into amazon my ipad!"
9666,1,excellent
9667,14,it never works properly
9668,9,bought it as a christmas present for my wife and my entire family loves it. other people have even bought themselves one after seeing mine. i love alexa
9669,0,very practical. now i can have music all the time by just speaking to it!
9670,0,"too many ""do not knows"", sound quality good, more a toy than a useful instrument"
9671,10,gift for my family on their anniversary.  hope they like it??
9672,10,"easy setup. very functional when you figure out the right way to ask her questions or the right way to tell her to do things. my favorite features are the shopping list, audible (audiobooks) function, and alarms/timers."
9673,7,love <u+2764><u+fe0f> love <u+2764><u+fe0f> this! got it for my husband to use in his garage and it is absolutely amazing!!!!! perfect gift for christmas!
9674,9,i love everything about it. the sound is awesome but the size is not.to big. just bought another one for upstairs.
9675,14,"the easy connectivity to my devices, the ""knowledge base"" of the device, and the wonderful sound quality."
9676,11,"the gen 2 is smaller but sounds better on the mid and low range.  missing though, is a manual volume control."
9677,9,why did i wait so long to get one. sounds great and so easy to use! buying another one for my bedroom.
9678,14,"terrific piece of electronics. liked everything and disliked nothing. now, if i could just get this playlist thing done i would be rolling!"
9679,14,"i like my music, but it is difficult to connect each time to wifi. i have to use verizon jet pack to connect, i do not have a local server for my home and it takes several minutes to connect."
9680,9,my brother and his wife received one as a christmas gift and i was testing theirs. i went home and purchased one the same day. i love it.
9681,10,this was a gift and we are enjoying having music so readily available not to mention the weather and instant information!
9682,0,it is a lot of fun.some trial and error figuring how to best to speak to it.but all in all a great product.
9683,0,i am still getting to know all of the things alexa can do but it was well worth the money!
9684,1,excellent sound quality for a small device.  excellent features.  i am truly enjoying it and use it almost daily.
9685,12,more than what i expected. i use her everyday to learn about history and to listen to music. she is very helpful
9686,14,so far so good. speaker can fill the room. alexa sometimes does not understand. could be the app.
9687,4,it is was easy to set up and makes retrieving information seamless.
9688,9,absolutely love it! it is a pleasure! if all alexa do is to find my phone then i got my money is worth! seriously it has become a business tool for me as well so the receipt is safely filed in a business folder!
9689,4,easy to set up easy to use would work better if i had and amazon music prime
9690,10,i love that i can listen to music from the 60s till now i love that i can get the weather forecast and the top new daily i think it is one of my favorite things i ownit was so easy to set up and start using took me like 15min
9691,2,love our echo!
9692,1,great sound quality and nice looking
9693,10,we love our echo. we have it set up to control the lights and makes it very easy to clean. home and turn the lights on. playing music is easy. we love it.
9694,11,speaker is not clear enough i have an alexa and it works fine this one must defective  i guess ..
9695,10,"easy to set-up, fun to use. alexa is in my kitchen. i love to cook & bake, so she keeps me company. great way to listen to my favorite music without the hassle of finding a cd. wonderful sound!"
9696,0,does not hear commands very well. i have to repeat myself at least 3 times before it either hears the command or does the correct command.
9697,14,"first tech device that exceeds my expectations. i do think alexa should come with ears that perk and a tail that wags, for when she hears her name called she is as eager to get going as my dog is when he hears his name."
9698,0,i am loving my alexa<u+2014> just need to know more on what all she does!
9699,4,"love it, use it often!"
9700,10,we like the music and we do not have to get up for the time. we were hoping to get rid the alarm clock but the alarm does not wake us up in the a.m. it it is great in giving you the nfl updates. love it.
9701,5,my daughter loves this
9702,4,works great.
9703,10,"i actually enjoy this device. i think every household should have one, even if its just to listen to some music."
9704,14,"like the sound, size, cost. easy to set-up. have original echo plus dots and taps and show, like them all, use them all the time. given many as gifts."
9705,14,like the tones of the music sounds besthow do you turn it off without unplugging?
9706,10,love my echo!!!! play music all day and any information i need is instant!!
9707,4,"easy to set up, great sound"
9708,11,the color is just gorgeous.
9709,10,"i use the it m most days for different lis5 and lao in cooking.  it,has been very helpful so that i do not forget things."
9710,14,it is a pretty good product but i need to get the echo dot or echo show i want to see recipes and make video call
9711,0,"we enjoy the product and are glad to have it but other than asking how old a person on tv is or occasionally asking it to play music, it is more novelty than useful."
9712,1,amazing sound and really fun...you will like the ¡°new¡± alexa!
9713,14,tried to hook up voltson smart wifi outlet had several try to do it no luck.  computer man was here and did it advertise was very misleading and costly would never buy again  feel like you owe some blame for allowing advertising
9714,11,"sounds better than i expected. i am glad i did not pay more for the sonos one. i wish it was a little more intuitive, like google on my phone, but works great at this price point."
9715,14,seems like i have to keep  reboot it twice a week to get it to act right. i do not use it that much but it keeps locking up
9716,11,"great fun and reasonable. can not go wrong, sounds beautiful."
9717,13,better purchase than my microwave or air fryer!
9718,0,i really like the echo.  it is great entertainment.  sometimes it is hard to get it to play a particular version of a song.  but i love it
9719,4,great sound!
9720,5,as promissed
9721,8,love it.
9722,9,purchased for my sister who is blind and in assisted living and she loves it - the higher quality sound is great. for every person living alone - it is awesome.
9723,14,not as easy to set up as they advertise
9724,14,"with the latest software updates, very good sound.  reliable recognition of commands overall, although some intermittent issues with ihome skills."
9725,8,love it!!!
9726,0,"i am still getting to know how and what to ask, but i will get there."
9727,12,great item lots of things you can do/learn with it.
9728,10,"easy set up, she has a personality during games"
9729,0,the sound is surprisingly good by it being small.... but what i didnt like is that it has to be plugged to the wall at all times. i was hoping that it was still operable while unplugged but it does not. =/
9730,4,the sound quality for music is great. very easy to use and link with your smartphone.
9731,1,alexa is amazing! good deal of cost! i love alexa!
9732,10,this is the best for our family! we¡¯ll always tell alexa to play music and it brings the family together in the kitchen every night!
9733,14,"look at the one star reviews, these really are not ready for prime time. if you have used a dot or tap you are not going to like this.  i had this device, to go along with 5 dots and a tap, for about a month. during that time i could never get it to stay connected to the internet for any extended period of time. even when it did connect to the internet, the response to my commands to anywhere from 5 seconds to never responding. i tried different wifi networks, giving the device priority on my network, deregistering, restarting, everything. eventually, because there really is no diagnostic support for these like you would find in any other electronic product, i just gave up and sent it back. i will be using an echo dot with external speakers in the future."
9734,0,"it is ok, but i end up googling questions because the echo does not know the answer a lot."
9735,1,love it!  wonderful for a quick question as well as a barrage of quick questions with fiends for entertainment.
9736,10,"it great give you info, plays music, play games, helps you spell words, recipes, you can talk to anyone on the phone and lots more."
9737,14,amazing piece of technology with impressive sound quality. you will not be disappointed
9738,0,what i like the most was how easy it was to set up and when playing music how good it sounds. right now we are only using it for information or to play music but i know that it can be used do more.
9739,0,"not sure about this yet, might return it as alexa was very frustrating to set up and she does not seem to know very much, for example ""alexa, what is the name of diane keaton is brother?"" answer - i do not know that information. hello, michael keaton is an academy winning actor too!! her music choices are limited and there is just too much she does not understand or do. also, while chatting with each other alexa often chimes in with ""i do not know that"" despite the fact we are not talking to her. we think we might have a dud, might return and replace, we will see."
9740,10,"we love our echo! for music and audiobooks it is fabulous! also use if for compiling grocery list (sends to the app on my phone). also love using it as an intercom! so much more she can do, we are still learning."
9741,0,"the speed at which the device works to return info. the least, that device often requires exact info or will not recognize request."
9742,0,a high percentage of questions i ask echo cannot answer.
9743,11,it is a step up from the echo .better sound.it is nice having alexa in another room.
9744,14,"the ease of saying what you want on your grocery list, instead of having to find someplace to write it down and then leave the list at the house, is  great.  set up was a little more complex than it should have been."
9745,1,excellent
9746,0,i love using it to listen to music and set reminders.  i do not like that it thinks i live in a different city and state then i do! i have emailed and followed all the suggestions given my help desk but nothing works.
9747,10,we enjoy being able to play whatever music we are in the mood for.  fun to ask echo questions or play a game
9748,1,excellent sound quality
9749,10,"love being able to get such information as an outside temperature instantly, all the way through being able to play games with alexa. mild annoyance of having to say ""alexa"" before each request."
9750,8,i love this
9751,11,better then the first units.
9752,1,love it. awesome sound quality and fun apps.
9753,14,"nice little device with reasonably good music quality.  limitation is that it does not play music from other major sources, such as itunes, napster, etc. which limits its practical usage."
9754,14,the sound quality on this is fantastic. love listening to music. one complaint is sometimes she has a difficult time finding songs in my library but has no problem finding them on amazon.
9755,12,it does what it is supposed to do!  still lots to learn!
9756,0,alexa talks to us! there is a lot she does not seam to know about!!!
9757,14,"i do not recommend this product due to the poor sound quality. i pre-ordered the 3-pack with the discount planning on giving them as gifts. i was embarrassed by how bad the first one sounded upon setting it up for my mom who i gave it to as an early christmas gift. gave her one of my echo dot is instead and am returning all three 2nd gen echo is. i love amazon and buy stuff from them whenever possible, but this is a big disappointment."
9758,9,was a christmas gift from our kids. it is wonderful. and very easy to use.
9759,14,when i wake up in the morning i ask alexa the time and temperature. i do not turn the tv on or get my glasses to check the time. i wish it used bluetooth so i would not have to pay for streaming.
9760,11,awesome!!! the volume is great and the echo is just the right size. it fits well with the decor in the room. it has a variety of functions and is compatible with several other electronic devices that i currently have.
9761,8,i love it!!
9762,10,it was easy to connect and we are enjoying using the echo to listen to music .  we also like the sound quality.  we would recommend this echo.
9763,14,"great, i used this as a cheaper alternative to sonos by placing them all through my home"
9764,9,i bought this as a gift for my aunt and she loves it! i won the 1st generation echo from my leasing office. she likes that she can call me from it.
9765,8,love it!!!!
9766,14,"sound quality is great, easy to hook up as well. have bought to dots to link up to it as well and am getting everyone i know hooked on the echos."
9767,0,easy setup. voice very clear and almost always knows the answer.
9768,9,"i have 2 echo dots, so i am obviously a fan. great sound."
9769,11,sound quality is a fail.  i am returning as this is not better than my echo tap.
9770,3,works so much better than siri
9771,12,i am really enjoying my new echo. it is taking me a while to learn all the things alexa can do.
9772,10,"easy install and user friendly. whether it is the weather forecast, the joke of the day or your favorite music, alexa does not disappoint!"
9773,12,awesome stuff. thank you
9774,11,it is got an amazing sound quality. better than the amazon tap! i just love the way it looks and how it blends in with my decor. i will be getting more for other areas of the house. i love amazon alexa!!
9775,4,totally love it1 recommend it for all households.
9776,10,love it. use it mostly for music and speaker is great. when i¡¯m super bored i¡¯ll have alexa tell me a joke - she never disappoints!
9777,1,great quality speaker!
9778,0,took a little bit of time to figure best way to get to information or music i wanted but now love it!  thanks.
9779,0,i have no problems with echo...has answered a lot of questions of information we needed.........have also had a lot of fun asking different questions.  some of the questions were about alexa herself.....well educated
9780,1,great sound!
9781,14,i had alot of trouble keeping it on line.  what i didnt know is my wifi wasnt fast enough and i had to get an upgrade to my modem.  but alast its up ans running.
9782,14,very nice follow up to the original. wish they would have kept the dial control for the volume.
9783,0,the sound is good but it does not always respond to commands - and fairly simple ones.  i find this perplexing.
9784,1,more compact--great sound
9785,1,alexa is a lot of fun and the music is great
9786,10,"being able to play radio stations through the device, the quality of the speakers is really superb"
9787,10,technology is amazing.  can ask alexa anything.  would be especially great for elder generation not so computer oriented.  love it.
9788,12,i love my new echo ( 2nd generation ) ! it sounds amazing and it does so many things !! i used amazon support to to help me set it up and the gentlemen was so patient and helpful ! i highly recommend this product !!
9789,8,we love it!!
9790,1,great !
9791,14,"most: ease of operationleast: can only hear a partial of the song requested and secondly, used too too too much as an advertisement to purchase something..ie. a whole album of the one song requestedaaa"
9792,9,"i like this product a lot! great sound! i have one upstairs and one downstairs and my family loves alexa. i do wish they would merge siri, alexa, and google to make her know pretty much anything you ask her."
9793,0,"it is nice, very sensitive with clarification. and randomly thinks you are talking to her, which is annoying. it is convenient though. i am happy about the purchase."
9794,1,perfect!!!!!!
9795,0,love it. work everything in my house as long as you have the right product that it program in to it.
9796,14,"i love talking to alexia, music quality is good, and the range was surprisingly good. it picked up several rooms away."
9797,14,easy to use and it feels like someone just moved into my apartment!
9798,10,"love the way it will find music i like to hear or change to another artist!also, the convenience of getting up to date weather, changing the tv station, and the list goes on!"
9799,0,i like being able to play my pandora stations through it. her search features are pretty bad though. even basic questions the response is generally she does not know or is still learning.
9800,0,fun to use! great song selection!
9801,8,love it!
9802,14,"update november 16:the device has received no updates since the one mentioned below, and it is still really lacking. the bass is louder than when the device first came out, but the higher notes still sound muffled. even the alexa voice sounds bad compared to the original echo. i am going to listen to it for another week -- and i really hope they release a new update -- but otherwise it is going back.update november 4:i received a software update (592452420) yesterday, but it is not much of an improvement. the bass is slightly more pronounced, but the treble remains muddy and high notes distort at high volumes. overall, the speaker still sounds cheap and tinny. amazon promises to keep working on this, so i am going to give it some more time before returning it, but i am fast losing hope about this device improving.(kudos to amazon for reaching out. i have received several calls about the concerns i raised in my initial review.)original comments:amazon should hang its head in shame over this device. the audio, which was supposed to be ""improved,"" is awful -- it is like a glorified dot. it is not nearly as good at the original echo or the tap. the bass is almost non-existent. the treble sounds tinny, and it distorts at volumes over 60%. although the original echo could have used more bass, it had a fullness and richness that made it a decent speaker. this new echo lacks that completely. even the alexa voice sounds annoying through this device. mine will be going back; i will spend my money on a refurb original echo. seriously, amazon, pull it from the store --you are just hurting your reputation with this."
9803,14,the whole thing works great. only thing i would warn people about is the the voice control for music only works if u actually have a prime account or a spotify premium account as far as i know
9804,8,love this!!!
9805,14,junk it never worked and the customer service guy from amazon hung up when we asked him a question.i would like to send it back but it was a gift.
9806,14,"sound is good, nice control of fire stick tv and the plug-in that bought with it. do not care for ""learning"" too hard to remember how to activate all the different commands. overall like it and it will get easier."
9807,14,many times the echo starts talking which is quite spooky.  no other noises in house and it starts speaking............
9808,8,love it
9809,14,"upgraded from the original echo because the 2nd generation claimed to have better sound ...  which is false.  imo, the second gen sound is not nearly as good as the first...  bass is barely better than a cheap $15 bluetooth speaker; there is almost zero resonation inside the new, smaller frame.  at least the higher frequencies are not as tinny as $15 speakers...  or i would be furious and send it back.i miss the spin volume control, another cost saving measure.smaller size does not matter to me at all...this pretty much only matter to a middle manager looking at cost.  the new fabric outside is ok, but not good enough to hide the obvious regressions from the original.there is a few reasons why the 2nd gen is worse than the original---  and all of them are a result of some middle manager  or worse--  consultant-- trying to cut costs, with zero understanding of what made the echo great.  shame on top management for allowing these cheap cost cutting measures...i am just going to use one of the options to send sound to a better speaker...  which i could have done with the original.  i regret upgrading."
9810,14,"it is great, except mine came all scratched :("
9811,11,"very happy with the purchased. am quite surprised by the level of sound quality, very impressive. cannot think of anything negative. glad i made the purchase."
9812,11,"full rich sound, better base and treble than the dot fo sho, stylish look"
9813,10,i did not find the sound to be very high quality.
9814,9,these make the perfect gift!
9815,10,the echo is everything i had hoped for. answers my questions and plays the music i have requested. highly recommend it.
9816,14,it sounds great!  i gave it four stars because i wish it was portable like the jbl.
9817,12,i like it. i have been enjoying it.
9818,10,i had picked up the amazon echo for my wife for christmas and she loves it very loud and easy to used
9819,14,"alexa reacts & responds quickly, sound is fantastic. the least i like is the alarm. i actually prefer alexa saying words to remind or wake me up, instead of the alarm sound, to make it different from an alarm clock."
9820,11,the style and height. the improved sound
9821,1,works great and has great sound
9822,14,easy to use and the volume and clarity of sound was great. it does not have all of songs requested and unless you subscribe to amazon prime or some other music platform.
9823,0,i dont teally thing it as good as i thought it would be. maybe there is just a learning curve.
9824,0,i like the timer settings when i cook and getting the weather. i need to learn to use it more.
9825,3,works great i do not know how we survived so long without it.
9826,1,poor sound quality!
9827,14,sound quality is excellent.  alexa can be exasperating at times. i wish she could play the mp-3 files on my computer. amazon music will not allow uploads any more.
9828,14,"the echo works fine and sounds great.  unfortunately, it cannot ""find device"", specifically a smart plug we ordered with it."
9829,1,very happy with my purchase of this echo!
9830,14,i just wanted something to listen to music in the house and this definitely does the job.  the sound is good!
9831,1,lots of fun
9832,11,great!!! i got the echo spot too!
9833,14,i love the concept but i can not get my music going. amazon says there is already an account and they can not open mine??? can not figure it out. will keep trying
9834,14,my wife has prime and i do not. i bought echo as a surprise at christmas. we both buy through amazon. turned out to be a problem when setting up echo. please fix this problem.
9835,14,does what it claims at a lower price.
9836,0,"this is a fun gadget to have around and pretty easy to set up. i am not impressed with the sound though, a lot of bass and there does not seem to be any way to adjust it that i can find."
9837,9,fun interactive speaker. pretty good quality when using as a speaker for the cell phone. will order a second one for myself as i gave for a gift and the family has loved it.
9838,0,i like it would have given at 5 stars but for some reason keeps disconnecting from the internet and i have good internet connection but other than that i like i like a lot
9839,9,"i bought like 7 of these for myself and grandkids. they love them they each have in their rooms and their parents want them. i use mine to control music, alarm and hvac system with ecobee. great item."
9840,1,very pleased with this product.  the sound quality is excellent.
9841,1,sound is great on this speaker. good quality overall.
9842,11,great sound from this unit. wish it had a battery!
9843,0,its a novelty. love it
9844,4,easy to use. very convenient. smart home tech is awesome!
9845,0,loud and clear sound.  i like alexa answering all my questions.  i wish more free stuff would be available...
9846,1,good sound quality
9847,2,love my echo!
9848,1,"love it, loud, clear and awesome!"
9849,12,i just love the echo! awesome quality! i¡¯m having a fun time with her!
9850,11,have really enjoyed this device
9851,4,works great!  easy to set up!
9852,14,great sound quality. super responsive microphone. integrates perfectly with my philips hue smart lighting. only down sides would be price and sometimes background noise causes alexa to not (hear)/respond to commands
9853,0,alexa understands my commands easily.
9854,9,the 2nd generation echo is even better than i had anticipated.  after a friend showed me how well his worked i know i had to have one.  this is one great product.
9855,9,"the amazon echo has been a great addition to the family, my kids and grand kids all love talking to alexa when ever they visit, we love it we¡¯re amazed every time we ask for something, great buy i recommend it"
9856,10,"everything, jokes, music, weather updates"
9857,14,the sound quality is great. i did not realize it was the smaller version of echo plus instead of this model. (but shopper error.) also i assumed i would not need a plug-in cord to use.
9858,11,i love the look and think its cute. just a little disappointed that it does not go as loud as the first generation one. but otherwise it picks up my voice very well and does everything i expected it to!
9859,0,i love alexa. i have not figured out how to use her with my tv but we love music and she is right there when we want to hear a song or get the weather. it is a great investment.
9860,10,i love alexa and so do the kids. i play music all day on her and the kids play their songs and games like 'simon says'.
9861,8,love this thing!!!
9862,10,we love our new echo especially to access the variety of music available through amazon music but still trying to figure out what words to use to get what we want from alexa.
9863,9,it has been great so far. we all use this as the main source of music in the house
9864,12,received as a christmas gift. still exploring all of the functions. definitely looking to automate some of the things in my home!
9865,1,sound quality is excellent.alexa is fun and informative!
9866,11,i like the convenience however the set up was not a easy as expected.
9867,3,"it is great to have it, you do not know it until you have it"
9868,10,"i love my echo. i use it everyday to play music , check the weather etc..."
9869,0,this is not what i expected it would be. it does not remember who you are by voice. you have to reprogram it over and over.  not impressed at all with it. i am think i should have bought the google one instead. thanks
9870,10,very happy with the echo.  love all the music stored on it.  my husband uses it everyday while walking on treadmill.
9871,7,you¡¯ll love alexa
9872,11,rich sound and sleeker design.
9873,9,i love her
9874,8,works great i love it
9875,14,i love the quality of the speakers and the vocal control
9876,10,fun and easy to use it is like having a very smart friend in the house
9877,12,so far i am loving this
9878,4,we love alexa.  the device was easy to hook up and easy to use.
9879,2,"love it, it is the greats."
9880,14,"such an awesome device. wish it would sink to my smart tv, guess samsung is not supported yet. but overall very cool."
9881,14,"i like the quick response from alexa; however, i am somewhat baffled by trying to make a phone call through my echo."
9882,14,this is our second. first worked great. this one will not play more than a song or two at a time and will not play podcasts at all. very disappointed. maybe time to try another smart speaker.
9883,9,love it ordered 4 echoes and one echo show wife put a stop to it lol that what she thinks but they all work great
9884,0,i love it but it does not recognize my voice but about 99% of the time it does tho
9885,10,my very favorite news friend.  alexa
9886,0,"so far so good, works as expected however, sometimes it does not understand the person giving commands."
9887,14,"i did not think i would like this. i do not like to talk much at all. i never used alexa on my fire tv or siri on my iphone. however, it gets lonely around here in the day and it was nice to say something. alexa is upbeat and corny. she has useful skills. mostly, she plays my amazon music. (it will not play spotify unless you have a premium/paid account.it is not perfect; there are flaws. the speaker of the echo is good, but not great. i did not expect bose for $99, but it is not what i thought. it is better than the echo dot which i upgraded from because of the speaker. the ring lighting confused me at first. google that to find out. i got a green ring that would not go away (that is a message). you have to figure out how to play and delete those before it goes away.also, echo is always listening. it is like some black mirror plotline stuff! it is big brother. it is all those things, but i do not really talk much anyhow. you can mute it, but then you have to look at the red ring on top all the time. echo never sleeps and is always on (unless your wi-fi goes out). since she is always listening for keywords, she can not not listen. the company says they do not use it to retarget products to you, but it is hard to believe that they will not do anything with all that awesome data. to test this theory, i am going to say random things (without saying alexa to wake her first). tomorrow i will say armadillo or corndogs a few times all day. i will see if i start seeing ads for those things online. i know, paranoid!overall, there are lots of uses. i think it will get way better. i turned off the shopping and reordering stuff though. that i like to see first hand!"
9888,1,very helpful and useful
9889,5,got this for a friend.  she loves it.
9890,10,"alexa is my new favorite daughter, she does not talk back answers all my questions and plays my favorite songs, i m putting her on christmas card next year!"
9891,3,everything it is advertised
9892,0,works ok but alexa does not understand lots.
9893,1,great product with excellent sound quality. just the beginning of a new wave of home services.
9894,10,"great sound, learning more every day on everything alex does."
9895,5,i actually bought it for my sister in law and she loves alexa
9896,4,loving the echo! very fun and super simple set up. sound is great for such a small unit.
9897,10,exactly what i was looking for.  love the charcoal fabric look too
9898,9,all i can say is we love it! everyone should have at least one of these...
9899,10,great devise
9900,8,love alexa!!
9901,12,music sounds good. i am still learning
9902,10,the echo is on demand when you ask her for music to ordering stuff on amazon. we love using the echo . i would recommend this device to everyone!!
9903,0,poor performance. apparently i do not understand what you can do with it. every time i ask for information it refers me to amazon on line and ask me to subscribe to amazon for a fee or in not compatible with apple.
9904,10,"love it! bought it as a joke after my toddler daughter watched commercials and started to give imaginary alexa commands. question of the day, amazon music, weather updates i could go on and on! sound is excellent!"
9905,8,love it!!
9906,10,"it is great-love it. occasionally she forgets about the music selection i¡¯ve picked, but, it is perfect for my varied musical taste."
9907,14,i¡¯m not as pleased as i thought i would be. since i set it up i have had charges to my bank account from amazon that i do not know what there for?? and i downloaded the alexa app and amazon music and it does not work.
9908,9,"our son, who has 4 echos in his home, got us ours for christmas as a gift!  it is our first and we have been having fun just talking to it and asking questions. great product, easy to clean."
9909,0,the commands i do not like the sound of her voice
9910,10,"i love alexa, my husband just getting use to it."
9911,0,it is a lot of fun.  picks up speech  even from the other room but you have to speak slow and clearly.  i like the amazon shuffle play selection of music.
9912,9,i like how i can now make calls with the second echo i have upstairs. i also like the new material it is made out of. so far i have had no problems with it. i love it!
9913,12,i like it and still in awe with everything it can dovery pleased
9914,14,love it. only problem i had was changing internet provider i had trouble. resetting it cured the problem.
9915,0,how quickly she answers you
9916,0,"i¡¯ve had mine for about 2wks and i¡¯m very disappointed. it is so overrated, do not waste your money. so far all mine can do is play music and tell me the weather."
9917,0,works good . still learning all the features. would have rated 5 stars if it came with a battery to make it portable.
9918,10,"alexa is great. i play music and use it for recipes and trivia , my kids use it to help them spell check things. it is an everyday usage kind of thing. definitely getting our moneys worth"
9919,4,fantastic item.  meets all my expectations and more.
9920,14,another great product from amazon. impressive sound. connects easily with dot and other compatible devices.
9921,1,i like the look and feel of the device.  sound is great and alexa is helpful.
9922,14,works as advertised and i look forward to installing additional alexas throughout my home.
9923,10,"like the echo, use it all the time for music, time and date and whatever info that i need."
9924,1,"it is a great product at a decent price,"
9925,14,not enough information for an old fart like me i am 55 years old trying to learn new technology and if you would put something more about it in you know what you can learn off this and stuff i would really appreciate it
9926,1,"works perfectly, the sound is good and delivery was speedy! recommend!"
9927,10,excellent purchase. we use it numerous times a day.
9928,9,i have really enjoyed my echo. so informative and fun with all the capabilities. can not wait to try new ones. three echos were given as gifts for christmas in my family.
9929,0,can not get enough! we love this device
9930,2,love my alexa.
9931,11,the sound quality is excellent. music is clear and the volume can be turned up quite loud. this echo is very responsive and a lot of fun to use.
9932,10,it changed my life but can always use more updates.
9933,2,this product met all my expectations
9934,11,"love it. i got the echo dot first, which i really like. however, the sound of the music being streamed was not the best. with this version, the sound is amazing."
9935,0,my kid and i love this product. sometimes do not recognize words but overall. it is excellent.
9936,10,"i love my echo! it is so convenient, fun, and helpful. i use the echo for lists, music, knowledge, and games. there is still so much more i am learning about the echo. my kids love playing with the echo, as well!!"
9937,0,"love our new alexa - did not know how much ch we would use it, but talk to her multiple times every day!  would definitely recommend"
9938,14,"initially was somewhat disappointed at the extent of it is options, but since setting up so many new options are available.  i hope they are here to stay and not just trial questions."
9939,0,"do not like that it has to be plugged in.  also, wanted to listen to a particular song... neil diamonds ¡°sweet caroline¡± and alexa said in order to do that i would have to pay 3.99 /month.... bad!!!"
9940,10,i love my echo it reminds me of my daily tasks also tells me weather news and other things also she has a great sense  of humor
9941,11,i like the look and the compact design but it seems slower to respond than my 1st generation echo and my echo dot.
9942,14,"love it to use even for alerting me as a kitchen timer, alert to add softener in washing machine. hey, i have a korean, samsung washing machinethat i hate!  alexa makes for a smoother ""wash day""!!!!"
9943,0,some questions she should know the answer to and does not however the genus questions she can give answer right away.. needs a little common sense
9944,10,love love itso cool to ask it the weather or play my local radio station
9945,14,"i liked how easy it was to set up and start using for weather, integrating into wireless music in my house but disappointed the temperature control has not worked with my nest thus far"
9946,1,alexa works very well
9947,10,"love my echo! always able to find or suggest the things i am looking for when i ask. great games, fantastic sound quality, and even a couple of jokes that round out the great experience of owning an echo!"
9948,14,"the echo would¡¯ve received a 5 star but because it can not be personalized to one person  voice it gets a 3. it would be nice if it can only recognize the owners voice, anyone who say alexia has control of the device."
9949,11,very happy with this overall.  only issue is false positive responses and audio quality is good not great.
9950,4,"great addition to the kitchen, fun,easy to use."
9951,14,a gift device without a remote...no batteries. great concept. limited music. but it quit working after a month. it is now back in your hands for repair or replace.
9952,14,ordeal to reconnect.  gen 1 you unplug echo and plug in and it will reconnect automatically.  gen 2 you have to go through all the steps every time.  use your phone app.  set up gen 2 echo.  search for wi-fi.  then find echo gen 2 and reconnect.  then it broadcast some amazon3 signal you have to sink with then password your wi-fi.  argggggg.  sending back.  gen 1 refurb would be better by far.  plus at&t dsl sucks and the router does not like the echo.
9953,1,love the sound
9954,11,i already have echo dots. bought this to finish my network. great sound. very responsive. new colors help it to blend in.
9955,14,"this is my second replacement in a week with the same problem. the voice locating led ring points in the same direction every time no matter where i stand. it is in the middle of a quiet room. it would not bother me so much if it could actually hear what i am saying. i asked it to ""locate hue lights"" and it responded, ""okay, playing music."" i did the voice learning enhancement where you read ten sentences, but no luck. this second one came in a plastic bag around the box unlike the first one. i thought this would fix my problem. nope. the light ring just points to the side where the power cord comes out. i have tried different rooms and different outlets with and without a power strip. did a firmware update on this one. also spoke with customer service who forwarded me to technical support. technical support wanted me to exchange this one as well. that would be number three. no thank you. going back for a refund this time.  i am really disappointed. i wanted this over the apple homepod coming out soon because it is so much cheaper. i think i just learned that you get what you pay for. i am really disappointed."
9956,1,good sound. good microphone. would recommend.
9957,12,she is great ! so much fun
9958,9,"i like the quality speaker. i like the easy access to pandora, bible app, my favorite radio stations. i am not very tech savvy but the echo is so easy to use! plus, alexa is helping me learn more <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+008a>."
9959,9,best purchase 2017 right here
9960,10,i received it as a gift and had paid no attention to the product.  i enjoy discovering new uses for it with each new notice about what alexis can do. its  a convenient tool.
9961,5,love it.  it was a girt for christmas and the best gift ever.
9962,7,i love it <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+008d>
9963,10,"love to have alexa make animal sound to get our dog, buddy, howling along. and the jokes, the weather reports and her sweet voice keeping me company is a big plus for alexa."
9964,11,gen 2 is even better than the original!!! love the echo. this one has better pick-up when calling alexa. the sound quality is better and it is more aesthetically pleasing!
9965,10,love my echo. easy to install and we use it everyday mostly for music
9966,5,it was a christmas present from my sn.  i love it!
9967,10,i love alexa
9968,2,my wife and i love alexa..our new best friend
9969,10,i enjoy this product and am happy that i can use spotify with it and listen to radio stations.
9970,1,love the sound!  great quality!
9971,14,"it is not was clear how to connoother devices. it is difficult to remember all of it is capabilities.  not remembering them means they are not used, reducing the value of the device."
9972,13,best money i ever spent
9973,12,so far so goodjust getting used to itgreat item
9974,1,great piece of technology. my wife loves it in the kitchen.
9975,3,love it i do not know how i made it without it thanks amazon
9976,11,impressive audio and superb bass from such a little speaker. poor audio quality at first but much better after 1st update. good volume level for a main room or large space such as kitchen/living room.
9977,0,available information is limited.
9978,9,purchased this as a gift for my boyfriend and he is can not stop using alexa. great product!!
9979,9,we are obsessed with our echo. it works really well and looks great!
9980,8,just love it and it is perfect
9981,8,it works great.
9982,14,great device.  i wish i could create my own wakeup name.
9983,14,"overall sound is great. still training alexa to understand commands. also having issues with music stopping unexpectedly.other than that, this is an amazing device for the home and i would highly recommend it."
9984,0,"i am disappointed,  says sorry not sure. sorry ,i do not know about that one. i wish she was connected to internet."
9985,14,"my boyfriend purchased this thinking it was going to be wireless but it is not <u+2014> it has to be plugged into an electrical outlet.  also a lot of the questions asked, are not answered."
9986,0,i thought it would be able to answer many more questions
9987,3,the sound quality is not what i expected. but overall it worka well.
9988,1,great product
9989,0,"great sound, with an immense amount  of functions. can not think of anything i did not like."
9990,10,i love this speaker. the sound is great and the fact i can tell alexa what i need is so cool.
9991,9,echo is great. keeps me company. i live alone.i may purchase another one.
9992,10,"great product! you can connect to the internet with your voice, which makes it fun for the entire family."
9993,10,great device. i do not need an alarm clock anymore and love getting the weather for the day immmediately.
9994,14,wish it had a better instruction guide with a large list of voice commands that can be used to help set up and a step by step guide to use with it and do the final setup with the app
9995,9,"love it, makes everything easier in my apartment.  use it as my tv speaker as the sound quality is awesome.  have a dot in my bedroom too."
9996,10,it very helpful when you have a nagging question. i am amazed that it has so much information on hand an how fast it answers the qustions.  i also like the music appt
9997,9,this is a great product.  the sound was perfect for us with a big open concept house. my kids love to use it too.
9998,3,works as advertised.
9999,14,"i started my echo experience with a dot paired to a bose soundlink 2.  it sounded fantastic.  i then ordered a standard echo (gen 1).  it sounded fantastic too.  the dot still sounded better but its more convenient to have alexa and speaker in an all-in-one.  this year i bought the new echo (gen 2) after reading all of the reviews and sitting on the fence for awhile.  truth told, i would not have bought one if they did not have a fantastic christmas season sale.  turns out i was pleasantly surprised.sound:  most of the reviews online i read said the gen 2 did not sound as good as gen 1.  so the first thing i did was did a non-scientific test.  i put gen 1 in one room and gen 2 in a second room and sat between the rooms.  i wanted to see if they filled the rooms.  i am not an audiophile and for reference, alexa sounded the same on both generations.  i ended up going from room to room and started with music groups so each room was filled with the same music.  what hit me first was that amazon has done an impressive job and syncing the devices.  as i walked room to room the music sounded only slightly better on the gen 2.  it sounded fuller, but not by much.  i still give the edge to the dot paired with the soundlink.aesthetic:  the grey one looks fantastic and, as advertised, fits everywhere.  it does look better than the gen 1 because of its shorter and decorative exterior.  it also looks tons better than the dot with the soundlink.good purchase?  with this purchase i have filled out all of the corners in my apartment.  it is sitting in the bedroom and wakes me up every morning.  i am very satisfied with the gen 2.  if i had a choice between doing the dot thing again, the echo gen 1, or the echo gen 2, i would definitely go for the gen 2.  it is a really good deal price per performance.  will i be buying a second one?  the other two are still doing fine so i doubt i will be ordering another gen 2 anytime soon.  but, if i ever find myself needing a gift for someone or to fill out a newly purchased home, i would not hesitate getting another one."
10000,10,"was a surprise kind of gift at christmas, but now i absolutely have the freedom i have always wanted while working around the house.  alexa helps with everything!  awesome technology and the sound is super clear."
10001,10,"this is so cool.....listen to any music you want to hear. news, sports, weather......she has it all!"
10002,1,great
10003,10,great music
10004,10,alexa is amazing!!! the questions you can ask her and the music. the speakers are really good
10005,11,"the sound quality is not as good as the original echo, and i miss the volume dial."
10006,10,i love it.the the sound quality is amazing .so much sound from a  6-8 inch cylinder .it plays any music i can think of from the past .the grocery list is cool .it answers most questions that i have .
10007,8,"love it,"
10008,12,have not figured out how to use??
10009,10,makes my life so much easier.  provides me with so much information.  i just have to ask.
10010,1,"lots of fun, useful, good sound!"
10011,9,i love it!  i bought for my husband for christmas.  we use it about everyday for checking weather and music.  would absolutely recommend it!
10012,0,"enjoying the question of the day ! also news. there is alot i can not get alexa to do ,not on prime but only get social security very limited on funds.would love for her to play some music."
10013,10,"love it!  we have a lot of fun with alexa.  the sound is great and even basic questions and answers are extremely handy.  when i am cooking, quick conversion questions are a frustration and time saver!"
10014,9,"this is the first time we had echo.  we enjoyed it a lot for world news, information and music.  it is light and  convenient to carry anywhere."
10015,9,i just love my echo. it is so amazing and fun to use. i love how you can play games with alexa  and you can play music and everything. the best christmas gift i got.
10016,9,it took getting new wifi in order for my echo to work.  she works great now.
10017,0,not as impressed as i thought it would be .  it does not do that much. i am sure i am supposed to know how to go into an app and adjust things and make it work better but i do not know how to do that
10018,3,love.
10019,10,totally enjoying this.  best sound quality imaginable.  alexa keeps getting smarter too.  love this little cylinder!
10020,9,i received this as a gift from my children and was told by mygrandchildren needed alexa as a friend and my music.  so precious of them and it is awesome product. my friend alexa.  thanks
10021,9,"we have had it about a month and a half now, and my whole family loves it. even my 2 year old can operate it and asks it to play her favorite songs. lots of neat features."
10022,1,sound is incredible
10023,1,awesome lots of fun
10024,9,had my doubt about the echo. after a easy setup and playing around with alexa i love it. would highly recommend it to who ever my have doubt is about it.
10025,5,given as a gift and thanked
10026,11,"more compact, nice textured finish"
10027,14,fantastic life changing gadget.. now if i could just get my 4 and 5 yearolds to stop asking alexia to play the sountrack from moana when i want to listen to the beatles and relax...
10028,11,i love the new echo. the sound is amazing. i even bought the dot to use in other areas of my house.
10029,14,"i can get the unit to play music, but it always turns itself off-why?"
10030,2,alexa is awesome
10031,8,i love it
10032,1,perfect fun
10033,0,we¡¯re not the most tech savvy of people so i was a little worried about set up but it turned out to be extremely easy to install and use. we¡¯re enjoyonh it very much.
10034,12,"just what i expected, and very quick shipping.  still learning about its uses and capabilities."
10035,8,love it

10037,9,my father got this and has not stopped listening to music ever since great product great sound
10038,12,love what she has done so far - i still need to learn more about other items she can do
10039,1,works great
10040,0,"the only good thing it can do is play music, and that does not even work half the time. very disappointed. always have to unplug to restartwont wake up does not understand... just a poor product!!"
10041,9,i love this echo. it is amazing. love listening to music from hard rock to tune from broadway shows. bought another one for my summer apt
10042,14,"this echo did not work for us at all. once in a while it would here us ask for something but 99 percent of the time it would not  even do anything. i called customer service and they responded with a flavor like "" we see all your request and you had no problems . they had me un plug it and plug it back in and ask what time it was and it worked perfect . then when i got off the phone it was not responding at all. moved it all over my house no luck. it was a pia.  it might be a cool item if it worked. we were just checking it out. it seemed like another electronic device to mess with and i do not need anymore of those.  i will just buy a blue tooth speaker and play music that way.  good luck to the rest of you hope it works out"
10043,10,works great love the features that make routine tasks easier.
10044,14,"we ordered this along with several echo dots throughout our home and it has made everything easier from working lights, to using it as a intercom. i feel like george jetson. i only need that dog walking treadmill."
10045,11,nice product - but price dropped right after i bought it. poop
10046,0,great device.
10047,10,"i use it in the kitchen to play music. once in awhile i¡¯ll ask a question and most times, get the answer i¡¯m looking for. i am enjoying this gift i received from my children!"
10048,10,the music is absolutely awesome.  i have just subscribed to amazon music unlimited and i am already thrilled with it !!i have not found any faults with my echo  !!
10049,7,<u+2764><u+2764><u+2764> it and easy to hook up
10050,14,seems to do all the things they advertise. have added a couple of lights. it is fun to work with.easy to set up and connect to wifi.
10051,3,i received alexa as a gift and absolutely love it! i just wish she had legs!!
10052,10,"so excited that she plays any music we want, great sound, easy to understand."
10053,12,getting used to alexa.  so far so good.
10054,10,awesome.  get one!!
10055,1,"great for entertaining, love it"
10056,3,i do not know why i waited so long!
10057,10,i love my echo! it is like having a built in secretary helping me with all my reminders! & of course so much more!
10058,10,i have enjoyed having music playing as background.  sound system is very good.  alexa is also very responsive to questions.  it will be fun to watch her grow and also our ability to use her skills more effectively.
10059,5,gave as a gift. recipient very happy.
10060,10,"the sound quality is excellent.  i find myself listening to more music and like the many different free features (weather, grocery list, trivia games, etc.)"
10061,4,"easy set up, groups works great. good sound."
10062,8,love it
10063,14,i love everything about this item except it does not let you use skype through it. this is an important feature trying to reach out to far away relatives and is very disappointing to find out after purchase.
10064,11,have owned first generation echo for 2 years and it is still working great.  added 2nd gen echo in home office and am loving it.
10065,14,appears good but we are unfamiliar as to how to use it other than just asking questions.  is there a customer service rep that could help us?  someone that i can talk to in person.  i am technically challenged.
10066,10,loving alexa even though she answers back
10067,14,was not a big fan but my kids talked me into using it and it is great. have not found out all the things it can do
10068,1,"great, as usual"
10069,1,great product
10070,14,novelty at best! constantly stops playing music for no reason! do not waste your money until maybe 4th generation...
10071,1,beautiful case with amazing sound and response!
10072,1,it is fun!
10073,9,i bought the echo and love it so much i bought a second one to out upstairs.  very easy to set up.  very sync!  love it!
10074,10,what i like mostly about echo is how full of knowledge it knows and the music is awesome. i like using my voice to hear different songs instead of using a remote control.
10075,14,i do not have a clue why i waited so long to get this. use it all the time - everyday. it is playing the music i want right now - added an additional bluetooth speaker too.
10076,14,"add another echo to the household!  #4.  and now, operational on my phone/in my car.  what a trip!"
10077,14,"because i live in a remote part of mt w/limited data, the use of alexa made me go over my data limit & doubled my bill after only a week of use. it has since been put back into the box & tossed in the closet."
10078,1,echo is a lot of fun as well as being very informative
10079,14,i love being able to listen to music and have fire tv hooked up to the echo!  bought a total of four!
10080,10,"great finger free product to get information, fun trivia, songs, and so much more! alexa has become part of the family!"
10081,10,"awesome device! lots of fun and very convenient for music, info, shopping, etc."
10082,9,bought this for my husband for his birthday. . . he likes it and the rest of my family loves it too.  sound quality is awesome as is the range.  can not wait to explore all alexa has to offer.
10083,10,really enjoy what you can ask. it is sound is good without having to connect to speakers.
10084,1,excellent
10085,10,alexa met all our expectations and more. can not imagine life without alexa. can not wait for the next generation to make life even more enjoyable
10086,0,i find myself asking alexa more and more...what a time-saver!
10087,14,the entire device is fascinating. i am amazed with the sound that comes from such a small unit. i like the shopping list. the down side is the timer/ alarm is too low to be heard even if the volume is raised.
10088,0,"i like all the new features and it is really good at recognizing your words (much better than siri).  but, it still has logic problems.  when i ask for a sirius/mc channel, it always takes at least two times."
10089,0,did not like it at all at the time she does not understand what i am saying and it is not cordless i have to unplug it and plug it back in wherever i go around the house i can not even take it in my car and use it
10090,9,great sound! purchased this before christmas 2017 and wish i have had it sooner. i do not use it for ordering but i do like to track my packages. mainly i just use it for music and it is nothing short of awesome!
10091,3,works great and recommend this . would buy another one! d. gamble
10092,7,"my first echo, i gave it 4 out of 5 because it does not change color on the philip hue lights <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+00a9><f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+00ab>"
10093,14,power cord did not work after a few days!!!i had to buy one somewhere else!!!
10094,0,i did not like that it does not recognize most commands. you have to learn commands rather than just talk to it like you would siri. also having to program every aspect of it via phone takes too long.
10095,10,"it is entertaining from time to time until the new wears off. best feature is daily weather, news report, and playing music on queue. beyond that, this thing has a long way to go."
10096,12,love it. has decent sound. still playing with it. going to use it to make a smart home.
10097,10,i like listening to my audible books and asking her questions. wish i could get the sound from my tv to play through  echo.
10098,10,variety of music and information.
10099,10,"alexa is entertaining, plays music from any genre and tells jokes...helpful; know what the weather has in store for us for the day, so we know how to dress! i would like to see her operate my vacuum cleaner."
10100,14,"had difficulty getting it to connect to my internet service.  had to get professional help.  have not yet discovered all that i can do, but working on it.  enjoying the music i love."
10101,1,sounds great and it is fun.....buy one!
10102,4,so easy to use and has great sound
10103,1,sound is great. i am really happy with it.
10104,14,love my amazon echoes...i have three creating stereo throughout my home!!!
10105,9,i purchased the exho for my other half as an early valentines day gift. we love the sound and setup was pretty simple. the next step for us will be to add a few echo dots around the house.
10106,14,the music!wow!
10107,9,christmas gift for my husband . its set up and ready to go. can not wait to see the look on his face.
10108,10,fun to play around with.
10109,1,great sound. great product.
10110,1,love having access to alexa.  this speaker has a really nice sound.
10111,9,this product is amazing!!! sound is wonderful!!! best thing i ever purchased!!!
10112,14,i really like this device.  but the web site has different options that the phone app.  need to be able to use your on alarm sounds.  needs to be a little easier to program.
10113,14,i like the music and the ease of operating. it took me along time to get it working with my ipad and wifi and felt the directions could be made easier for a sr. who is not too tech savvy.
10114,14,the speaker is really good. so easy to ¡°ask¡± for music and there it is !!!  for once not struggling to connect some bluetooth device  and scroll through some music app to find something !
10115,8,i just like it
10116,14,"it is convenient and and sounds great, but we often have to repeat ourselves and many nights sounds that we supposedly have on loop quit in the middle of the night."
10117,3,i do not know how i lived without my alexa!
10118,14,this is the first time i have used any type of these systems.  it has exceeded my expectations.  the sound is very good. lots of fun!!
10119,10,i¡¯ve had my echo for two weeks and so far i have one word- love!!  there are still a lot of features that i need to utilize but i¡¯m enjoying getting to know alexa!!
10120,8,love it! great sound!
10121,10,just get it!!! you¡¯ll love it!
10122,0,good stuff
10123,10,everything - wonderful to play whatever music you like at any time and have questions answered - my daughter loves playing games on it - she is great addition to our household :)
10124,14,"i am held ransom to get any real use out of it. buying prime, spotify, etc....."
10125,14,i bought two of these to play my music around my house for my kids shortly afterwards amazon ended the ability to upload music and have not found a better way that does not take 5 commands to play a song.
10126,1,excellent product. high quality unit. lots of fun. everyone who tried it loved it.
10127,14,"ask alexa to play a specific artist is songs (ie. bon jovi) and she does! the flash briefing is ok, but would like the option to designate the news source or sources , (ie. fox instead of reuters)."
10128,10,we enjoy alexa - i feel like she is underutilized though. also she has great sound when playing music.
10129,9,i am really enjoying my alexa. i like having information at the sound of my voice and love all the music offered on amazon radio. i even ordered another one for my office and an echo dot for my bedroom!
10130,14,"as cheesy as it may be to write this, our echo"
10131,4,easy to set up and begin.  pics up on my voice easily.
10132,12,works well mostly use to listen to music. do not have smart home do not sure what else to do with it.. still happy with purchase
10133,3,she does not now as much as google does
10134,8,i love it
10135,10,i love to be able to listen to music whenever i want and whatever i  want to hear with the amazon unlimited music for 3.99 a month.
10136,10,it has been wonderful to learn all the things that alexia can do. we start the day with the weather and then listen to a joke. she keeps my grocery list close and loves to play games!
10137,12,"great product, lots of fun, still learning how to use it, it is like jeopardy you always have to say ¡°alexa¡± first lol"
10138,0,"i like it for the basics music, weather and funny jokes. but i do not find the echo smart.  i get allot of i dont understand basic questions and maybe it is the boston accent :0)"
10139,0,i love listening to music and the sound is great!  i do not like the repeating of songs so very often and christmas music included!
10140,11,"could have better bass, otherwise it is great."
10141,11,love the sound quality.  its better than gen1 if you ask me
10142,1,i like the new color and the sound is greatsuch fun
10143,10,"has a very good speaker, sounds great. makes getting the news and music you want to listen to simple."
10144,10,i like alexa when she can give me answers to my questions. when i asked her for the temperature in different foreign cities she was stumped.
10145,10,"it is small but has such a powerful sound. love asking questions and am,amazed of the quick responses."
10146,10,"we enjoy our echo very much. she is the first machine i have ever seen that plays music, makes shopping lists, tells jokes and plays games. she has a sense of humor as well. we did not expect that."
10147,14,"it was a lot easier to program than i thought.  sound is great.  i purchased an echo dot at target for my bedroom, the volume on that is not as loud as it could be.  had a gift card for target."
10148,0,i do not like the fact that it does not work when it is nt plugged up i feel like it should have a charger and can become fully charged  not connect to charger all the time and the cord not long enough
10149,11,"i like the textured cover. the speaker is just as loud/good as my first generation echo, but this one blends right into my home because it is not as large."
10150,10,everybody in my house like it. a lot of fun!
10151,0,learning  more everyday about questions that can be answered and tasks that can be performed
10152,11,fabulous blends right in with my decor love it love the sound and control
10153,0,ok for the most part.. sometimes it just shuts off on its own or does random talking even when i do not active it.
10154,10,i love my new friend alexa!  she is company for me & informs me of things i need to know & things i am just curious about. alexa lights up my life!
10155,12,i am having so much fun with alexa i can not stand it. love it
10156,4,i adore my alexa!!  it was very easy to set up and connect to the wifi and this small unit puts out great sound. i absolutely love it!!
10157,10,love this! very easy set up-hours and hours of fun! not sure what we did without this and it is only been a few weeks! highly recommend!
10158,11,i love my alexa!
10159,11,"works well, sound quality is nicer than expected at the price point."
10160,14,i only have one thing to say ! why did i wait so long to buy it .its awesome
10161,10,"the amazon echo is amazing.  we ask what the weather is going to be, played trivia, endless music.  we love it!!"
10162,1,works great! sound is perfect for our large open living room/ kitchen.
10163,14,i love the echo. so much that now i bought the echo tower.
10164,0,still having a hard time programming
10165,14,sound is good but alexa is garbage compared to google assistant. i only use it in the kitchen for a bluetooth speaker. and do all the smart home things with the google home.
10166,2,i love my echo the sound is amazing.
10167,10,i mainly use this for music only. it is a great speaker with excellent sound.
10168,9,it is everything advertised and more. we use it mainly for music and the sound quality mixed with bass sounds awesome for such a little tube! i bought one for my mother and one for my son amd they love them
10169,0,"alexa is so cool. i am still discovering things she can do. especially like the news, jokes and weather. sometimes she does not understand what you are asking her but find if you reword it she eventually does."
10170,0,i think i it is really good but it does not always recognize weekday your saying and it know general information about a lot of things but it does not know very specific information about most topics
10171,7,"she makes the ""italian"" a little bit jealous i think<f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0089><f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0089><f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0089>"
10172,10,very so please with it. the best part is that i use my outlook calendar on computer to set date and bills due.  all i say is alexa what is on my calendar and she tells me. love it..
10173,14,i do not find this to be the great time saver/ helper that they lead you to believe it is in the commercials. it was a gift so i¡¯m fine with that but i would never purchase one.
10174,14,love my echo! i was kind of against the whole idea of this thing but i have to admit i am 100% on board the alexa train now.
10175,1,the quality of the sound is terrific.ease  of integration with my other devices was  simple. we are really enjoying this purchase.
10176,0,"we all love it, i was surprised how well she understands what you are saying"
10177,9,got this for our master bedroom and we absolutely love it.
10178,14,can not believe that amazon does not offer a free 3-month subscription to amazon music unlimited. this is a giant speaker.
10179,14,nice quality for a smaller size speaker.only wish it was able to be used w/o having to be plugged in 24/7.
10180,11,i¡¯m very happy with the echo
10181,12,"i love alexa, she is so smart and helpful"
10182,12,i love my echo! it is fun learning new stuff about it every day.
10183,14,"i have been able to connect my sonos sound system, and lutron light system to my echo device, and can walk into the room and tell echo to play my favorite musical c with the lights turned down low!"
10184,0,"great sound, responsive to requests, not liking that you need to hook up with amazon music to play specific artists or music"
10185,10,love that i can get the weather or listen to my favorite artist in a snap.
10186,1,"we love our echo.  very nice sound from speaker, great speech recognition."
10187,3,great product as you advertised!
10188,0,"you need to say some words exactly right or alexa does not recognize it or she rambles on about something totally different. speaker is excellent quality, better than i expected."
10189,12,love everything about the echo. support is wonderful and easy to learn all of it is capabilities.
10190,1,sound is amazing.
10191,8,super convinient product!
10192,11,the sound is really good compared to the echo dot.  i really like the woodgrain finish.
10193,10,i love being able to hear any song i ask for.  sound is good...alexa is funny!  i love the suggestions that are sent to me on different things i can ask her.  best thing i have purchased in a long time!
10194,5,it was a gift
10195,8,great product
10196,10,love alexa.....it fits perfectly on our table without taking a lot of space.....has a great sound with music....easy to use and set up
10197,0,"i love that i can use it to remind my husband to do things.  i wish it were preprogrammed.  i would like to use it to listen to music, but i need to figure it out and i do not have time and i hate doing it."
10198,14,"the amazon echo is way better than the google home assistant that i had previously, like night and day."
10199,14,it works so good and the sound is so clear that my wife annoys the crap out of me with it. can you make one with a head phone jack?thanks
10200,14,still have not gotten connected
10201,8,love it
10202,0,an impressive little performer it does everything advertised.it songs and answers questions.
10203,11,love it!  my first exposure to ai and it is working as designed.
10204,14,love the product. it is really easy to use. i am still working with support however to fix my issues with spotify
10205,12,very happy with alexa but still learning how to use it.
10206,12,"the sound is great, what it can do is great and we have not even scratched the surface of all the things it can do.we love it"
10207,14,a great bang for the buck. i am a self admitted apple fan but the price to performance ratio can not be beat. between the smart home integration and the multi-room audio i¡¯m a happy customer.
10208,14,"positives: speaker is good, songs are numerous if you have amazon prime. easy setup and install.negatives: alexa just is not very smart. she knows about 1 of every 4 questions."
10209,14,there are no parental controls. my kids were listening to a song on it that we had heard on the radio before. we had no idea it had bad words in it. alexa does not edit or have clean versions of the song.
10210,5,family loves it.
10211,0,liked that i could order up a radio station and tell alexa to tun it off in a  hour.
10212,10,"i have had my alexa for a few weeks now, oh my gosh does she make life easy! i love her, money well spent!"
10213,0,"found it hard to set up , once we did it wanted to run off our spotify music and not my prime account, still can get to play random music as it needs a specific artist list of songs to play!?"
10214,14,"i like most everything, but especially the reminders that can be set so easily. it still has some improving on its database of knowledge, but overall a great piece of technology for the home."
10215,0,"love the sound, i play my amazon music through alexa in the morning. i like the information when i ask.  some things you have to know ¡°how¡± to ask, but overall it has been a great experience!"
10216,0,"the device it is good but honestly i was expecting more from it, and i¡¯m having a hard time getting amazon unlimited music it does not let me get it"
10217,0,we ask her everything...lol
10218,3,it was bought as a gift and it arrived in a timely manner. it works like advertised. it is in use and was not returned. that must be a good sign!
10219,0,it is a fancy radio.
10220,14,i like it because it tells the weather and news by just asking but. i guess its not fully functioning because its not hooked up correcly hooked to  our internet provider. idk why that is. buy im not satisfied
10221,2,i love alexa
10222,0,"a nice piece of electronic is for the household.  not only the music but the related apps that help to remind me to do things, relax and improve proficiency."
10223,14,"i have a google home which i love, but got this for my dad for christmas since i heard the amazon one might work better with his stuff (apple).  i tried to set it up for him and had a ton of issues trying to get this setup - first it had trouble just connecting to the wifi.  i had to do the same setup multiple times and restart the device a few times before it finally connected to wifi.  once that starting working, i then found out that just to play music (the reason i got it for my dad), it seemed like my dad needed a music subscription - no free ad-supported version like with the google home.  i tried the amazon service, and even amazon prime did not seem to allow you to play music on it - needed a separate subscription.  then tried spotify, and after signing in there, you can not listen to spotify for free on the amazon echo with ads - why not?  finally as a last ditch effort to get it working, we grabbed a sonos speaker that my dad already had and hooked that up in an attempt to use the sonos account that my dad has for the sonos speaker.  i managed to ad the speaker to the amazon echo, but it could not use the sonos account to play music (not even on the sonos speaker itself).  we gave up and just played music on the sonos speaker through the sonos app which works perfectly fine.  packaged this up and returned it - i got my dad a google home instead since i know that works."
10224,10,i like the sound.  i like the ability to time stop playing  and i like the ease of setting the alarm.  i look forward to selecting the music genre when i buy amazon music or prime.
10225,10,"i am amazed at what alexa is capable of. i use it every day for pretty much anything. timer, music, laughs, weather, information etc. i¡¯m so glad i received this item for christmas! i absolutely enjoy it!"
10226,4,very helpful.  fun to use. sounds great.
10227,1,great sound!
10228,11,awesome!!!! love it!! can do so much and has great sound with the music. would recommend to anybody looking for great sound and can hear it all over our house!!!
10229,10,i love my echo. i just do not know how to use it for all it can do. i am also a senior and got it as a gift from my children.
10230,0,"it is very easy to use. sometimes though alexa randomly says things when i do not say anything or does not hear me clearly, but that is technology for you. otherwise, it is a very convenient tech tool to have."
10231,0,i bought it for the sound which is not the best.  it also has to be plugged in at all times which is inconvenient.
10232,0,not what i expected. most often she can not answer my questions. more often than not i am forced to pull out my phone so i can google my question. mostly i just use it to check the weather and listen to music.
10233,9,the whole family loves alexa!  my girls treat her like a friend.
10234,9,it is now my good friend !
10235,14,just a amazing device i have it programmed to a tp link smart plug. allows you to turn on or off any device via phone or voice command. will do everything you ask.
10236,1,great sound and amazing technology
10237,1,great speaker!
10238,9,my husband bought the echo as a christmas present &  enjoy it tremendously.  there is nothing i do not like about it.  great product.
10239,0,love how she can find my songs and play all day for my cat. some things she has a hard time finding and playing. but overall experience is great. i have not used her for orders yet.
10240,9,i bought 3 of these for my married kidsand they all love them the grandkids rock out with the music its great
10241,12,it is doing what we expected.  no problems.
10242,14,the search engine capability is actually very limited compared to competition. i was expecting to engage in a dialogue once i asked a question related to a given topic or event.
10243,10,"amazing!  alexa recognizes everything i say, creates a shopping list for me, plays my favorite music, tells me jokes and is fun to have!  highly recommend!"
10244,4,"very loud speaker easy to use , love amazon products"
10245,14,love the look. do not like that i can not just reach over and turn the top for volume. i know i can tell her what volume number but enjoy the turn of the top on first generation.
10246,11,sound quality is superb. only thing i would improve on sound quality is the range of bass notes the speakers can reproduce
10247,14,"received the echo as a christmas gift, love it. with prime i can listen to unlimited music, very impressed with the sound. being a dish network customer i synced it for hands free control of my television."
10248,3,works as described.
10249,10,some patience to set it up
10250,10,works great. use it to adjust thermostat and turn lights on and off. also the occasional question.
10251,2,i love my alexa
10252,10,"my kids ask questions to it all the time, i have it set up for my commute in the morning for work and it is pretty loud for that size of a speaker"
10253,9,worth every penny. my two year old loves playing with it. sound is a lot better when it updated.
10254,3,love itbetter than google home
10255,14,"the device works fine upon wake up i have not used the plug in hub yet and i have not tried calling or messaging, i love that i can listen to videos from my phone and music messages, so far so good !"
10256,9,love the sound and how i can connect the entire house!!
10257,8,love it!
10258,11,"great sound, way better than first gen."
10259,4,ease of set-up. sound quality is great.
10260,0,i can not figure how to connect it.
10261,10,"love it, has great sound, everyone has fun asking questions"
10262,12,we love it and learn new things to try with alexa every day
10263,9,santa brought just what my son asked for!
10264,0,it has great sound and is fun to have. it does not seem too smart but they say it will improve.
10265,0,"we are enjoying it, however,  i asked to play some music by floyd cramer and she did not know of him - a well known pianist. that was a surprise."
10266,8,love this
10267,14,it was everything and more that i could imagine once i got home i really did not like the cover i thought it was gray and it is blue other than that i love it where can i get another shell?
10268,14,great !  get one !
10269,3,everything i wanted it to be.
10270,14,loved the unithave 2 in my home disappointed they do not link nor play at the same timeshould not be charged for 2 units if they cannot both be used at the same time
10271,10,"i love my echo. there is nothing i do not like. sounds to sleep by, weather immediately in any town i wish, music anytime with any song i request, and all of my questions answered. who could ask for more?"
10272,12,so easy to set up and has so many features.
10273,1,love it love it love it.  best sound quality ever. would absolutely recommend it.
10274,10,like having information at my fingertips.....just ask alexa!!
10275,14,does not run right. it runs but not right.  this is the worst piece of electronics i¡¯ve ever owned.
10276,0,good sound but not a lot of answers also for music directs me to amazon music which is pay for very disappointing.
10277,4,super easy to set up! speaker quality is great!
10278,14,alexa is like having a silent person in the house who only speaks when spoken to...love it!  especially love the music
10279,10,my son loves that alexa can turn the lights off and on and he loves that she gives him kid news. :-)
10280,1,the sound is great.  responsive to voice commands.  all around impressive.
10281,10,"impressive.  wide variety of music access.  good sound quality.  wife is using it a lot for kitchen recipes and help.  start my day with news, weather and other content is great.  easy to setup. great value."
10282,12,i am loving this so far and unfortunately so are my kids!  does everything i need so far.
10283,14,"it is great for a person who can not read the clock, see knobs, etc. every once-in-a-while it just does the unexpected-turn off or on."
10284,14,"syncs with our front door lock, door bell cam and hue lights.  the whole family enjoys playing hanes with alexa daily."
10285,0,i love that she listens to me and tries to do as i ask ; the challenge is having to go back and set everything up on the alexa app; it is not a problem it is just that it can be time consuming.
10286,0,the sound quality is very good. my biggest problem is figuring out what it can do.
10287,5,my grand children love it
10288,10,"alexa is so easy to access. love the music, weather, and the knowledge."
10289,14,impressive wealth of information readily accessible. does not always have the music we want to hear nor the insight into what our taste is (yet).
10290,14,i thought there would be more functions and when i ask for some songs i get amazon samples instead of my spotify. bottom line i like it.
10291,0,"it is different but tends to go down with no reason.  also, i can not move it to a new location without having to reprogram it.  the only thing i like abou it is the music from amazon prime."
10292,11,i like the size and look; i do not like the volume setting of positive and negative button. i preferred the turn dial.
10293,10,i found many things echo did to make life easier. it did have a bit of a learning curve.
10294,2,we absolutely love alexa!  highly recommend!
10295,12,sounds really good when playing music.  does what i expected of alexa
10296,12,this is amazing and still a work in progress. but once you figure it out its amazing.
10297,14,works good if the internet connection is good.
10298,0,"wish she knew more things that i ask her, but overall her sound quality is great and the linking to smart lights is really helpful."
10299,10,love this speaker and alexa!  it is so much fun and informative.  my favorite thing to to stream music and ask alexa to tell jokes.  this is the best thing ever!
10300,0,great voice recognition and sound as well.  does a lot of different things!  awesome echo!!!  can not believe i did not get this before now!
10301,14,would be nice if i could play my music from the computer on the echo instead of uploading to amazon cloud
10302,10,"it is fun and convient. i dislike that you have to add things to a list one at a time and sometimes it can not give answers, i hope with more usage that will change. but even with that, it is great to have"
10303,0,"sound quality is good, it is easy to use. my greatest disappointment is that i am unable to use my apple music and itunes songs. at least i have not figured out how yet. otherwise i have enjoyed the echo."
10304,1,love it. speaker is amazing!
10305,12,we are still learning all the capabilities of the echo but so far it has exceeded our expectations
10306,0,we mostly got it for the speakers. it does great at that aspect. everyone in the house is connected to it. alexa is not that good at answering questions or understanding what we say.
10307,10,"these are just awesome, works great with spotify, wemo switches and nest thermostat.  so many fun apps, weather, bible .."
10308,0,"just one more item tomake us more lazy. lol.alexa does almost everything you ask of her. too,bad she did not do housework darn i hate doing housework."
10309,14,impossible to set up for this computer expert.
10310,0,this is a great product! it is very informative. sometimes it does not know everything but it is very knowledgeable. i will recommend it to anyone who is interested and do not know about it.
10311,3,better than i ever expected!
10312,9,a new family member to our home in alexa!
10313,10,i like that i can listen to all kinds of music genres all day and night by voice activation. the speaker quality is fantastic
10314,10,"currently, i am just having fun, and ask alexa new questions every day."
10315,9,this item was purchased as a gift and was well accepted by the person receiving it!
10316,9,recommend everyone to have a echo
10317,10,i love listening to music without tuning  the radio and being able to have the sound louder or softer but words alone
10318,0,"i love this echo! the music quality is great and it is easy to control. sometimes if there is a commercial for alexa on the tv, my echo will do what the tv says so just do not put it too close to the tv."
10319,0,great device. very useful and fun to use. we learn new things that its capable of almost everyday. worth the money without a doubt
10320,1,item is awesome.
10321,7,bought for my friend whose name is alexa....i have no regrets <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0082> it functions very well and it is fun to use <f0><u+009f><u+0091><u+008d><f0><u+009f><u+008f><u+00bc> would probably buy one for myself next time in the future <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+008a>
10322,0,this is more a curiosity than particularly useful.  more hype than value.
10323,11,i am definitely enjoying my echo
10324,4,crystal clear & easy to use
10325,11,love the sound on this one! you can hear it loud and clean on the entire main floor of my house!
10326,0,can do anything and everything. money well spent
10327,7,i love that i can just ask alexa to play music <f0><u+009f><u+008e><u+00b5> i do not like how precise your questions need to be and i do not like that i can not ask ¡°how are the belt parkway and staten island expressway?
10328,1,"neat little piece of equipment. the audio is very nice, and the use is very easy. i have really enjoyed my echo (2nd generation)."
10329,10,"i am really happy with my echo. i can hear my news, music, traffic reports, and many more other things without much effort. it works really nice."
10330,14,immediate access to music at a very good price.  no need for susciptions/monthly charges.a little difficult to set up with android phone.
10331,8,love this item!
10332,1,works great
10333,12,love alexa .  still learning all she can do for us.
10334,14,i like how quickly it response and the sound. if it does not know answers to questions it tells me to use the alexa app witch hardly helps at all. i am still learning any feedback would be appreciated
10335,9,bought for my son. should¡¯ve kept for myself
10336,5,we love it! best gift ever!
10337,10,i love alexa she is great for last second questions on recipes helps with spelling and music is right there when i want it... not to mention i can call people with her connected to my phone.. i love it
10338,10,"the echo has been a fun addition for my house. it can update weather forecasts, play music and answer all kinds ofquestions that arise throughout the day.  a lot of fun!"
10339,3,got exactly what i thought i would. when i thought i would for what i agreed to pay. it works just fine.
10340,0,"it is fun and entertaining, but not especially useful. good for some games. not real current."
10341,9,shipped quick and great to give as a gift.
10342,12,we love it!
10343,3,as expected.....
10344,14,totally enjoy it. at this time i have nothing negative to say about it. it is been a useful & joyful tool to have in the house. planning on purchasing another one for the house soon. thank you.
10345,14,"it was fun and easy to get simple news from alexa, disliked it because its hard to wake alexa up with background noise, you have to basically tell alexa for it to hear you and yell the commands"
10346,1,everything is great
10347,1,love using it. have it setup with my smart home system and it works great.
10348,11,"great device! i feel sound quality is a little better than first generation, which i also own. smaller size is nice and having multiple colors/finishes to choose from is cool."
10349,1,"very fun to have around the house, pretty helpful too!"
10350,14,i love this product. however i wish they would/could come up with a cordless model. that way you can just move it whenever you need to.
10351,9,yes one of the best inventions ever! we have been throughly amazed at the alexa. our daughter uses it everyday from questions and games to alarm clock. would recommend this to all of our family & friends.
10352,3,great sound and price.  it is made my life easier and more satisfying.
10353,10,love alexa! still learning what things i can use it for. love the music sound and that she can hear me when i am across the house in bed to ask the weather before i get up.
10354,14,sound is great. sometimes you have to get creative on how to ask for a certain song but other than that i am very happy with it. i also gave one to my sister who loves it.
10355,9,"nice for home use, i use it mainly with amazon music."
10356,9,"great little machine sound is really good ....., my mom has it now she loved it so much . i¡¯m buying myself another few."
10357,9,love it paired with smart outlets and calling capabilities.  especially love unlimited music i added as well
10358,14,alexa is easy to use and understands your requests. the sound in music is great! just cant get echo too far away from modem for internet connection.
10359,9,"i love this item, given to me as a christmas present. the color matches my grey walls and being able to say alexa play something is so awesome!! i do not know how i have lived with out this."
10360,10,works great and she responds to almost all of my commands!!
10361,0,"she is a great digita assistant but in order to use her full potential, you must have a lot of smart features, but she is fun and easy to use.  i love her jokes and flattery."
10362,0,"it never seems to be able to answer my questions, alexa is unsure most of the time"
10363,0,"well, it is lots and lots of fun; however alexa has difficulty with my accent (boston) when it comes to performing certain skills."
10364,10,"i could get some of the older music, music of the 60s without any hesitation. i could even get radio stations."
10365,14,this thing is a piece of crap. constantly trying to reconnect and wont turn on. totally not worth the time or money.
10366,10,"pretty amazing piece of gear. have not even begun to access all the talents of alexa, but she amazes me every day."
10367,2,i like the new design
10368,10,"this thing is so much fun, it was worth the cost just to listen to my 3 yr old grand daughter try to have a conversation with alexa"
10369,14,wont answer phone unless another amazon echo  wont call unless in my contacts.  most music wont play unless i pay more.  does not answer many questions that google routinely does  a real disappointment
10370,10,"we love it! use it everyday for info on the weather, timer, question of the day, play jeopardy, ask questions,love it!"
10371,0,it has a very good sound system to be so small. the least alexa start talk when she hear the commercial on tv she start talking and scared me. but i¡¯m still learning what is all it does.
10372,10,just what i expected.  enjoy having it in the house!
10373,14,i thought i was upgrading from the dot.  music is not my thing. so that part has no effect.
10374,10,i am enjoying the music on echo.
10375,10,i love the answers she gives me and how well informed she is. the stories she tells are very interesting and the jokes are so corny that they are actually funny
10376,4,"love, love the sounds.."
10377,11,not quite as good as the original. does not recognize my voice as well and the music quality is not the same. for the price it is not a bad deal but the original is definitely work yay extra money.
10378,14,love it! the only thing i wish it had was the ability to lower the volume without giving a verbal command
10379,14,amazing thee things it will do. we are novices at this kind of thing. just glad she likes the green bay packers!
10380,10,"so far i like how i can listen to my xm radio through this unit, and using the flash breifing, and shopping list functions.i dont care for how you have to speak specifically when you talk to it."
10381,14,it still has the same problem as the first generation. have to repeatedly reset it to get it to work. does not like to play on livingroom group with our dot.
10382,11,echo (2nd generation) has very good clear sound that actually can be played at a loud volume. the skills that it is able to do is very impressive. i love it.
10383,9,i love it.  it answers my quick questions and plays my music.  best gift i have gotten in a while.
10384,14,"terrible sounding speakers, do not know what is dolby about this. google home sounds much better in comparison. bought it in indian store, but they are not letting us to write reviews, so writing here. not worth the price."
10385,12,this item is great.  i am still learning all the things it can do.  the sound is excellent!
10386,12,better than i expected it to be. so easy to use as well. my kids are constantly using it as well. a great party pleaser.
10387,10,i love alexa!!!  i love the music the most. so far i can mention her name in the room.  the funny thing is she comes on when the tv commercial on alexa is on.
10388,1,nice sound
10389,10,the music that is available just by speaking was my favorite part.
10390,9,love my alexa. gonna smarthome my apartment with it.
10391,10,my grandkids are having a blast harassing alexa with weird questions!!!  the music is great and we can all listen to our different kinds of music.  the sound is fabulous.
10392,0,"it plays music ok. for general questions and answers i here ""sorry, i dont no that"" a lot."
10393,14,stopped producing sound over a whisper after only using a few times. hard time getting a prompt refund after returning.
10394,10,"we love our echo.  it has been easily integrated into our lifestyle.  it is mainly used for timers, weather, news briefs, music and for answering simple questions."
10395,11,got a great deal on this and the echo dot.
10396,1,great sound.love the color and the lights. works great with alexa
10397,14,"i love it.  it goes outside with me on the deck, while enjoying the pool and garage while working on projects."
10398,3,i love it!  does more than my sonos....
10399,10,"love it! i use this everyday. alexa has replaced my alarm clock, is my number one music device and news information. no issues yet she is full of fun and skills a plenty!!"
10400,1,best money we have spent in quite a while. love it!
10401,11,"the first generation had better sound, why would you offer a newer model with less sound quality it makes no sense."
10402,0,sha comes on sometimes without me calling her name. she does not turn over unless she is told two or three times. i hardly ever turn her on since she has a mind of her own. it is almost scary.
10403,14,excellent product; much more versatile than its competitors if you are willing to train ir program it.
10404,9,just received my echo and i¡¯m so in love!! must buy !update: i¡¯ve ordered two more after the first one. amazing
10405,3,i love the echo. just what i needed. great deal to.
10406,11,love the sound - much wider bandwidth than the original echo  including some bass
10407,10,"most of the time does not ""understand the command"". good for time, temperature, setting a timer, celebrity birthdates, other nominal inquiries."
10408,12,echo has met my needs so far but i have a lot more to learn and try before i can adequately rate it.
10409,9,i love the ability to listen to music.  i have one complaint.  we have a smaller echo in the family room.  why is it we cannot play both simultaneously in order to listen to the same music?
10410,14,works great!! drop in feature is awesome and i should be able to drop in on every echo at once
10411,9,love the hands free. sounds great where i have it.company loves it.  everyone wants one.
10412,8,absolutely fantastic product!!
10413,12,it has surpassed my expectations!!! easy to use out of the box and fun to try and master. love how it inigrates sonos.
10414,14,far better sound & understanding than the dot we have.easy to take on vacation - unobtrusive in the family room - an item we use every day.
10415,0,does not work outside usa.
10416,0,"i like the fact that you can ask it or request something of it and does what it needs to do. the only downside is that if a television commercial about alexa says the name, it will answer most times."
10417,14,"i was skeptical at first but when connecting it to spotify the affect i really fun in the house, music whenever you want without hasslealso i started buying smart home things afterg"
10418,14,very good sound.  response to commands mostly very good. linked to my personal music collection easily but commands to access specific tracks a bit clumsy.
10419,14,"beautiful product, was able to fulfill all my instructions and tasks and music requests.one thing i would note is that it does give a hard time with responding to hard-pronounced bands and music songs."
10420,11,i was very impressed with the sound that was what i like the most there was really nothing i had like the lease about the system
10421,8,love
10422,0,i liked the easy set up and the range of questions alexa answers. i dislike that alexa sometimes does not understand music selection in non english titles.
10423,14,the voice pickup works from across the room and is able to understand most commands. speaker quality for music is decent. i suggest if you plan on fully using the device you might want to consider prime.
10424,10,"easy to set up, great sound, lots of fun, a lot of product for the money! highly recommend and i am 68. grands love to use it and i do not have to worry about touching and breaking bc it is so easy to use."
10425,10,alexa gives us the weather and the news the first thing in the morning.also it is great to ask alexa to play music of almost any style.. we love alexa.
10426,8,great device..absolutely love it
10427,14,the equipment is fine. sound quality better than expected. but we are still learning each other is ¡®skills¡¯. not as user friendly as it seems.
10428,11,"love alexa!  my parents have the 1st gen, and it is very clear that major improvements have been made."
10429,14,"i like the concept, but it seems to have trouble staying connected and you have to learn how to use it"
10430,11,"its ok not much different than the first echo, just a little more bass, not much though..."
10431,9,handy now have 3
10432,14,"i programmed it and it still does not work..i got it for christmas as a gift..me, my brother and son tried to  get it to work and has not been able to so it is been in the box since new years.."
10433,10,i love it! it is the assistant i¡¯ve always needed! love the ease of use and how clear the audio is. great sound quality.
10434,14,"absolutely love this so far. thee only issues i have with it so far is1.  the calendar sync is not very good. i have several subscription calendars like football schedules and arbiter (referee assignments) that are pushed to the synced calendar. the app shows these subscription calendars are to be included (they are checked to be included), so it recognizes they exist, but they are not included. so if i ask what is on the schedule for tomorrow it will not include any subscription events. so for me it does not really work.2. no directv control, which i guess is not amazon is fault. seems almost ridiculous that directv does not interface with this. i know there are builds you can use and i have tried that but no success in teaching my echo a ¡®new skill¡¯.the call feature is actually very nice. i can now ¡®drop in¡¯ on the echo from work or anywhere. so basically it is like calling my kitchen and whether my wife or kids are in there i can communicate with them.update;  i quickly found a work around on the subscription calendars. i just used my gmail account and all of the subscription calendar events are now announced when i ask. apparently this is (for me at least) an issue only with the icloud calendar, not google. so i have 2 calendars synced and alexa notifications induced but now, including subscription calendars on google."
10435,9,"i was hesitant to purchase this, but i am so happy that i did.  it took a few minutes to set up, but now the whole family loves it."
10436,14,"super fun for a party, especially if you hook it up to your sound system!  if you can not use your hands its voice call is very nice."
10437,8,awesome
10438,14,nice speaker for playing music. app commands are cumbersome to remember.
10439,0,music selection and quality very good.  some problems with word understanding!
10440,2,i like everything about my echo!
10441,10,"i love it, i love everything, music, weather, time, news, etc"
10442,10,works great. love that it connects with sirius/xm radio.
10443,7,love the speaker and alexa! <f0><u+009f><u+0099><u+0082>
10444,14,what is not to like? very entertaining and useful. hook up some smart plugs and voice control your whole residence. do not let it access your phone.
10445,12,i absolutely love this echo! it has exceeded my expectations and i am very happy to finally have one!
10446,11,great product that needs improvement.  the sound system needs to improved including the interface with alexa. overall it works well
10447,0,i was expecting a lot from the echo but it does not respond correctly. it takes 7 or 8 times to get it to play the radio and sometimes i have to manually turn the radio off. it is really not that great.
10448,9,i love everything about my echo!!!! it is awesome!!! i received it as a birthday gift from my son and have had more fun with it!! she knows everything!! ;)  it really is amazing!!!
10449,14,this small compact model is awesome. a sirprising feature is i can make a call to mu children
10450,3,just what i thought it would be.  very good sound for music.
10451,14,"fun and entertaining for days. also functional. my kids love it however, alexa confuses easily compared with siri."
10452,14,have alexa turning on and of both tv and lamps. very hard to correct to devices to accomplish both of these tasks.
10453,9,so fun! we love it for music and info.
10454,0,amazing took. very convenient. the only problem is that i have to say ¡°alexa¡± multiple times to get it to respond.
10455,1,very satisfied. the sound is magnificent.
10456,12,"just learning to use alexa,  it seems to work simply and well."
10457,3,works great
10458,10,we love it! sound is great and we find this very useful for a multitude of things.
10459,9,it is been wonderful we have several echos and we have incorporated some of our light switches
10460,8,love it!!!
10461,14,"it works as one might expect an alexa thing to work. i use it to check the weather in the bedroom, as well as for relaxing sounds. very nice."
10462,7,the most playing songsthe least  playing games
10463,0,alexa can hear her name very well and usually has an answer for us.
10464,14,"not a huge fan of this. only hears me half the time and half the time it does hear me say ""alexa"" it does not understand what i said to it. thinking i may switch to the google home."
10465,4,handy and fun to use.
10466,1,nice device.  works with my smart home apps.
10467,14,i love this product a lot...looks great!! and even my 6 year old is in love with it...she asks lots of ?s which is fun to hear.the only thing i hate is that is so hard to connect to the wifi
10468,1,loved the more compact size. sound quality is very good.
10469,13,this is one of the neatest gadgets i have
10470,9,this echo has such great sound and it is perfect for the fun moments and the quiet moments. i use it every night to put my daughter to sleep with lullabies. i am so happy i have this!
10471,1,the sound is amazing for such a small device! it is worth every penny.
10472,14,"this is a great item for listening to music. the sound from the speakers fill the room.,  if you want a real laugh ask alexa to cut the cheese."
10473,11,"the new (2nd gen) echo is a great value. the responsiveness has improved significantly since gen 1, responding more quickly and more consistently to ¡°alexa¡±. the sound quality has also noticeably improved."
10474,9,when my son bought this for us i thought that it would never be used. wrong i use it all the time especially for music. love it
10475,10,"i received this as a gift, still trying to figure out all its functions.  love that it plays my radio stations"
10476,9,"the sound is wonderful for such a small device.  still learning,  as me in another 3 months"
10477,9,i absolutely love my amazon echo. i wish it was wireless but other than that it is amazing. i am such a techie so having my echo is amazing.
10478,2,so far we love our new echo. the sound is amazing.
10479,12,i love my alexa.  such a fun thing to have.  there is so much to lean and try.
10480,14,big disappointment. capabilities are far fewer than my phone.
10481,14,great sound and design. some features can only be used with certain upgrades but overall a very enjoyable device with lots of features and possibilities.
10482,8,luv it
10483,0,has nice stereo sound. but she does not know everything.
10484,14,"terrible! not mobile. have to have it plugged in to use it, unlike the tap. you cannot play music from your own library of songs. setup a disaster, as they have a glitch in the system."
10485,14,"it works really well. the only hiccups that i have seen so far is when i have some sort of music playing and it cannot understand me, but the alexa ecosystem has been really nice to use."
10486,10,love my alexa!!!
10487,11,nice to have it!
10488,9,we have thoroughly enjoyed our echo.  it is a great product and a lot of fun.
10489,9,"omg, the echo is so amazing, the sound, color, one of the best presents anyone could ask for. my wife fell in love with hers, she talks to alexa everyday and is loving it."
10490,14,initially started off fine but then stopped playing.  i called and was told it needed updating after only a few weeks.  i turned it off as instructed and have not been back to its location to test it.
10491,11,"the size, look and sound are much better."
10492,11,love the new design!! the sound quality is outstanding!!
10493,9,"this was my second echo.  liked the first so much i had to have one in the master bedroom.  i use it for hue light control, music and ambient noise in the bedroom."
10494,11,echo works well fabric is very durable
10495,3,"incredible! i expected a lot, but this i s way beyond expectations"
10496,12,very pleased with our echo took a little time to set up still learning the different functions very pleased with the sound quality thank you for prompt delivery happy with everything
10497,11,"the sound quality is amazing, rich and full bass and treble throughout the room and the voice recognition is spot on."
10498,14,i look me the questions answered trivia etc. alarm also nice. haven figured out how to play a entire album and get error code not compatible with 11.1 i think that is what it is.
10499,14,fun in home gadget! would recommend for smart home owners and people who use siri or cortana a lot for assistance.
10500,9,"we are using the echo in our baby is nursery and he loves it! although it is small, it has great sound quality."
10501,5,it was a gift. we love it. we r senior citizens and love the oldies that are included. very pleased with the sound quality as well. a gift that keeps on giving!!
10502,11,it sounds great without being overpowering.
10503,9,we love the echo!  everyone that comes over wants one.
10504,0,i cannot get this dumb thing to work and do not use it.  it will not connect to my wifi and i do not have help with it
10505,10,"having music, news, weather and information with a simple command is nothing short of miraculous. sorry i waited so long to purchase one! easy to set up."
10506,0,i like it but needs to know more
10507,4,my three teenage girls absolutely love this!  the sound quality is amazing and it is easy to set up and use.
10508,0,"it is got good sound, more than expected, and i like asking it for a song, or a question, what i can not find in the app is how to lower the voice, it is too loud! thank you"
10509,11,still not comparable to boseneed to improve speaker and sounds
10510,8,i love it
10511,14,i absolutely love my echo.  the price was excellent.  i have always been pleased with the products i have purchased from amazon and will continue to buy in the future.
10512,0,dont know what i do without it
10513,14,the sound is great and it seems to pick up my voice more easily.
10514,0,great product!!! sometimes alexa gets it wrong but that is fine.
10515,14,a little better than gen #1 the volume response seems sometimes a little sluggish and will just cut off if something unknown to it instead of telling you it does not know otherwise great...
10516,10,"amazon echo is a great addition to our home. the sandstone fabric finish is beautiful. we mostly use the echo to ask alexa questions, set alarms and play music. we enjoy this device daily!"
10517,5,it is amazing! bought it for my mom and she loved it!
10518,9,need help
10519,5,received as a gift! works great !
10520,0,"does a lot of unusual things, but speaker is difficult to understand."
10521,8,great
10522,10,so far so good. learned how to set up a group and like listening to a variety of music.
10523,1,the 2nd gen echo sound is awesome. its absolitely amazing crisp loud sound its perfect!
10524,14,"it is what i was hoping for but it really needs a chargeable battery in it. not being able to move it around without a plug is a bit of a let down. sound is good, features are elegant."
10525,14,i wasnt sure what i signed up for i didnt want to get into a monthy price  dowell thanks any way  i didnt even use it i probably would have loved it if it wasnt for that jackie bosley
10526,1,great!!
10527,10,"i love the feature of turning on the lights, controlling the ac and playing my favorite music. i dislike that alexa is always listening and has unexpectedly made phone calls for me. jajaj."
10528,2,love my echo
10529,0,i found the echo could not answer some simple questions.
10530,1,"great sound and very useful, i love it!!"
10531,9,i love my echo.  do not know how i survived all these years without 'alexa'.
10532,10,love it! great for listening to music
10533,10,"there is many question it don,t know"
10534,10,"good sound quality, great reception to voice and easy to setup. blends in with my bedroom, and can setup stuff like alarms and music very easily through voice commands."
10535,9,this is so much fun!  i got it for my boss for christmas and we have been having fun with it ever since.  great price for the product!
10536,1,"this thing is awesome!! sound, look, quality!! love it."
10537,1,very happy with alexa
10538,10,"sounds great!  love listening to music on it. love listening to the bible app read to me. some of the fabric is unraveling on the back seam, hope it holds up."
10539,9,"it is a fun gadget, sound quality is nice tooi can not wait to get the nest"
10540,11,understands command i dislike the sounds a little bit bad
10541,14,it works fine but i do not like the fact that it was $15.00 cheaper a couple of days after purchase.
10542,10,have not made the best use of it.  we get a lot of i do not know that.
10543,10,great purchase.  alexa can hear my commands clearly from any room.  i also like the sound that comes out of the speakers when i play music.
10544,1,the sound is excellent.
10545,10,my husband and i just love it!  can not belive we waited this long to get one!
10546,9,"my husband loves his gift, listens to music on it all of the time. great sound."
10547,9,so far love everything about it need to learn more things that it can do....sound is so strong and clear..best gift i ever got in a long time thanks to my daughter and her boyfriend
10548,14,"i am changing my review to five stars - first, for the product itself (buy the echo, you will not regret it), but also for the outstanding customer service by amazon.i am keeping my original review for those who might experience a similar issue, so that they know how to solve it. at first, i gave the product one star due to sound (see below), and amazon immediately reached out to me to offer tech support, or to replace if defective. after the product was reset (over the phone), the sound is now very very nice. it is like night and day, the difference is amazing. so it looks like  the problem was due to my particular unit is software, not with the product itself.i have now listened to my echo for a couple of hours - trying out different kinds of music - and i am happy with it. it fills the room with rich clear sound, and it is definitely better than the dot (which i also love).kudos to amazon, for coming up with a great product, and for outstanding customer support.__________________________________________original review (please note this is no longer valid - if you experience similar issues, call amazon and they will solve it, this is not normal for an echo):this review is for those who are considering ""upgrading"" to an echo from a dot. unfortunately, going to an echo from a dot turned into a severe downgrade in audio quality. i received my echo in january 2018, (i.e. after the software updates to fix the poor sound) <u+2013> the sound quality is still awful.first, about the sound quality of the dot:  i have owned a 2nd generation echo dot for about a month, it is in a smaller room, and i am very happy with the sound. the dot sounds very crisp and clear, and quite rich for such a tiny speaker - from piano solos to vocals, from jazz to pop and rock and blues, from latin/salsa/cuban dance to classic opera - it is all good. the dot does not fill the room, but for a smaller room it is perfectly fine, and the audio quality is very nice. i enjoy music on my echo dot.however, since the tiny speaker of the dot can not handle a very noisy environment, i ordered the full-sized echo in order to listen to music in my kitchen. i fully expected the echo to sound not just louder, but also better than the dot. unfortunately, the quality of echo is audio is very very poor!maybe i got a defective product? the echo is sound is beyond disappointing: it is muffled, muddy, flat, and plain disgusting. if you like listening to good music with clear rich vocals and detailed instrumentals, look elsewhere. listening to the echo is painful. my old alarm clock radio by sony sounds much better (more rich and clear) than this piece of crap. volume up, volume down - it is all bad. it is just bass and muffled sounds.as an avid music lover, i enjoy listening to my echo dot playing in the background - but i can not bear to listen to music on my new echo! the audio quality is that bad.i am debating between replacing this echo outright with a dot (and getting an external speaker for the kitchen), or maybe at first trying to exchange it for another echo, in case i¡¯ve got a lemon. but i have read so many reviews about the horrible sound of full-sized echos¡¦ i wonder if the disgusting sound quality is due to a major problem with design.i give it one star because of very bad sound, which makes it unusable if you like music. (otherwise, it is a five star product - responsiveness is great, alexa is smart, amazon prime ecosystem rules).why, amazon? alexa in particular, and voice-controlled ai with music in general, is such a great product - but what good is a speaker if its audio quality is crap?"
10549,14,i got this as a gift.  music sounds great and it was easy to setup using the amazon elexa app.i still think ai is creepy...probably the antichrist.
10550,11,"loved the 1st generation, but this one does not not respond as well and does not always understand what i am saying, the 1st generation worked much better."
10551,11,"mmmm so good! actually understands when i call out ""alexa"" even from like 15ft. sounds really good for the price too."
10552,10,we are having so much fun playing music & dancing! plus my girls are getting more organized with reminders & wake up calls ;)
10553,2,alexa is my new best friend
10554,10,we really like it and enjoy listening to music before we sleep.  best is to drop in on the grandkids.
10555,0,enjoying it except for the fact that it intermittently shuts off for no apparent reason. i have to unplug it plug it in again for it to start working again
10556,9,"the echo (2nd generation) was easy to set up, having a great time using it too!"
10557,10,i love it. you can tell it to give you reminder and it will. so many things! you will love it!
10558,11,the amazon echo is great. i have no complaints
10559,0,so far so good. only complaint is that sometimes it will activate without command word.
10560,0,"really starting to enjoy, but i think i need more to learn. does get set off by television a bit"
10561,0,i ask it to do a simple task and it says. i do not know that.
10562,0,echo does not integrate with youtube is a big disappointment
10563,14,i steel can make to hear me i been follow all the reset i have a first generation and works great sorry to give a bad review but i need help.
10564,3,i like it for what ever i want it is there very happy
10565,9,we¡¯re best friends. she gets me.
10566,2,loving it. she knows everything!
10567,14,"i love it, i only missing the spanish version for alexa, and it will be the perfect companion for listening music."
10568,11,i already had an echo and have enjoyed it but 2nd generation is better except for the volume buttons rather than the dial. it makes it difficult to operate in the dark or in a hurry.
10569,9,my family thought i was crazy when i bought this & now they can not live without it! we¡¯re getting the echo dots for all our rooms next. alexa is absolutely amazing. the speakers fill the whole room.
10570,12,fun and interesting . takes some getting use to! looking forward to finding more uses.
10571,9,"this thing is awesome. it is very inexpensive for what you are getting. a good assistant, and great sound quality. good job amazon."
10572,11,really love the device. sounds better then expected. has great volume also
10573,10,we love our alexa and use it daily.
10574,5,gave as a gift.  daughter loves it
10575,4,the sound is amazing and very easy set up..i love it:)
10576,1,great product. sound is pretty good as well for music.
10577,9,the sound is good for such a small speaker. still learning what all it can do. everyone that sees it wants one.
10578,1,"love the sound quality, especially the base."
10579,14,works well does what i ask it too. i will say if you live in a smaller home and have the echo and a dot they sometimes clash with one another.
10580,9,"this was a christmas gift and the recipient loves it.  it is a lot of fun, very responsive and i highly recommend!"
10581,14,great for a blue tooth speaker.  i do not otherwise keep the device on.  do not trust the company.
10582,10,"great device! wonderful sound. alexa has so many cool features. games, music, trivia, news, bedtime stories, alarms, etc. my whole family loves it!"
10583,14,"the sound from such a small device is awesome. however, having to pay a fee no matter how small to play music from my computer which i have already bought is a huge disappointment."
10584,0,give you what you ask.
10585,10,"responsive, easy to figure out.  it can do a lot more than i have it set up to do.works great for hearing music even from somewhat obscure bands."
10586,0,it is a good speaker with nice sound but it sometimes has connectivity issues but it also might be my internet connection i have not figured it out yet.
10587,10,great addition to my home.  love it!
10588,14,the quality of the sound is outstanding. i do not have a prime membership but i did subscribe to pay 3.99 a month for the music.
10589,10,we love it - alexa makes our kitchen more fun!
10590,3,everything i hoped for.  i love how it controls my smart home.
10591,9,love my echo! lives up to the hype! really easy to set up and so addicting! i already can not live without it. time to get another one for the second floor!
10592,7,love it!!!<f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+008a>
10593,9,love u alexa! just connected u to sirius radio u rock
10594,2,i love alexa
10595,10,"i ask echo to play christian music such as quiet, inspirational hymns, or instrumental and she has no clue how to find them.  what a joke! is this what amazon prime music?"
10596,9,"was skeptical about these at first, but i love it!  so useful in ways you could never understand until you have one."
10597,12,"so far, so good.  learning new things everyday, learning more about the echo everyday."
10598,10,"it is the same as using my cell phone. i do not see the benefit, for our household. the only thing we¡¯ve really been using it for is to play music while we¡¯re cooking."
10599,10,this helps my son with school and the jokes and puns are great:)highly recommend this product!!!!!
10600,8,awesome sound.  enjoy it everyday.
10601,9,i love my echo. i wish more people had them so i can call and text them through alexa. i also like alexa to read my books from my kindle app... the echo was a awesome christmas gift...
10602,14,"we are enjoying , little surprise what is not known"
10603,3,"alexa is not as ""smart"" as i was expecting."
10604,3,as advertise
10605,5,gave it out as christmas gifts and everyone that received it loved it.
10606,10,i got this for christmas and i love it! i use it all the time and the sound quality is great for listening to music. it helps me stay on top of my things with the reminder feature
10607,1,great!
10608,11,in my opinion the 1st generation has better sound.
10609,1,it is great
10610,3,as advertised. love it!
10611,0,i like the ease of use and setup do not like how some times it comes on without being prompted but generally works as advertised and makes doing household tasks easier
10612,4,easy to set up and works as advertised.
10613,9,great sound! did not know i wanted a second one. glad i got this one for the bedroom.
10614,8,great product
10615,11,"wow this thing sounds amazing, the sound is much better than the previous gen echo.  would recommend to anyone.  thanks amazon for  another great product."
10616,5,got this for a christmas presents for my wife she loves it
10617,1,amazing sound...
10618,14,i can not get echo to connect to the internet
10619,14,i got it as a gift and i like it! nice volume and bass. but alexa need to recognize more salsa artist when they are being requested.
10620,9,i know own three echo.  one in the bedroom one in the open kitchen/living room concept  and now my home office.  i love them!!!
10621,9,best new technology around! so much fun to stream all my favorites.
10622,11,sound quality is the same as first generation but max volume is much lower. because the reduce volume you do get  alexa is ability to hear you much better. be me not a major win but more of a loss.
10623,1,"great sound, bass loud and clear!"
10624,9,"very happy with alexa, she is the only one in my house that listens to me."
10625,14,"a great fun device.  great music, speller, current weather teller for most us citiesand good sound quality.  we got an outlet so alexa turns our lamp on or off at a command."
10626,0,i enjoy alexa!  there is nothing that i like least
10627,14,exceeded my expectations on this device. i¡¯ve never owned anything like this but siri on my apple phone. sound quality is awesome.  i love the different  materials they come in. i purchased the dark brown
10628,12,love it! still trying to learn all i can do with it.
10629,14,"warm, deep, clear sound. volume all i need and more. sometimes she can not find certain songs, even though i subscribe to all songs for $3.99."
10630,1,great product
10631,0,"i am not happy that it does not have spanish options...it is fun, but i still need to learn more. maybe at a later time i will have time to play with it some more."
10632,0,"when unplugged for any reason - we had to reset it up.otherwise it works as expected and desired.it has a nice sound, and responds quickly."
10633,14,worked perfectly right out of the box.  the app has a multitude of skills to teach her.  my favorite is ¡°pull my finger¡±
10634,1,lots of fun great for music
10635,11,speaker sounds crystal clear just as good as a previous bose one i had and new fabric design looks sleek n modern...love it!!!
10636,8,love it
10637,10,we love echo! especially at night to turn off all the lights in the house by voice command.
10638,10,so far i think she is great.  hands free operation and easy set up
10639,12,pretty cool so far.
10640,14,"in progress to learn the system, take sometimes to get all system connected and important i have to find the way communicate with alexa."
10641,14,"even if you like hard rock,metal this little one has big sound. fill your space with quality sound and can get you information quickly and hands free and alexa does not back talk! haha"
10642,14,"i have already submitted my discuss with my echo.... amazon only solution is to buy one of their ""books""! ... i would suggest all prospects do your home work before buying..."
10643,11,works great. a definite improvement in sound quality over the 1st gen. love the smaller form factor too.
10644,14,"i can already use these features for my galaxy note 5 and galaxy note 8 .i can use it to control my sprinklers bluetooth surround sound, and even more etc with the help of google"
10645,8,i love it
10646,11,sound is more muffled than the original and alexa takes longer to respond.  perhaps the the muffled sound is from the increased bass.  just not as nice as the original.
10647,10,i love that i can listen to any music i am in the mood for. i also love that she will make my grocery list for me. i know longer have to find my list & write it down!
10648,10,this is so much fun to own and the quality of music is amazing! learning many more  things to ask alexa each day!
10649,14,only issue is my kids are fighting over it and we will need to buy another one! (or a dot)
10650,0,"disappointing, everytime i ask it to play music it asks me if i want a 30 day trial on something. that sounds like i have to pay to get music soi say no. thats what i got it for."
10651,9,"just learning how to use with the app. got this from our daughter and granddaughter for christmas. the sound for music is amazing to me, great sound. alexa is voice is very clear."
10652,10,"absolutely the most entertaining device, alexa reminds me of appointments and shopping items, current weather conditions and much more.  can not think of anything i do not like"
10653,9,echos are the best. constantly evolving and improving. fun for the whole family
10654,10,device meets all expectations! does so much in making any requests simple
10655,14,"at 1st it linked with my spotify acct but then does not anymore.  it insists i open a new spotify acct by redirecting me. so no, i am not happy  plus  alexa does not answer a lot of questions"
10656,1,"loving it! great sound, and a good price!"
10657,11,"the speaker performs very well with a great sound and much more bass than i expected, which i am happy about. it is responsive, convenient, and overall a product that i would recommend to anyone."
10658,5,"bought this for my son who is in a wheelchair, amazing!"
10659,14,very hard to add anything to echo
10660,9,i love my echo.  i have two. one for the kitchen and one for my bedroom.  use them all the time.
10661,14,finally got it set up and it is not functioning properly.. too late from return.. go to best buy
10662,14,my echo dot can do many things once loaded with the many free and paid for apps. the best thing about my echo dot is use all free apps. speaker system is outstanding for it is size.
10663,0,i love it! just wish it did not need to be plugged in at all times.  also wish it came with instruction manual of more things it can do.
10664,10,we like to talk to alexa.
10665,9,my husband loves his echo 2nd generation. we use it everyday!
10666,1,awesome device technology and sound quality. i am very impressed with it.
10667,8,love it!
10668,3,this product is amazing!  there is so much alexa can do that makes life a little easier.
10669,10,"i like it because it is an adult toy,music and weather and jokes all by just asking. my grand kids live it the most!"
10670,0,"waste of money. almost anything we ask the response is ¡°i¡¯m not sure¡± ¡°sorry, i do not know that one¡±. we are not impressed. like i said, waste of money."
10671,0,i love that it can understand my voice from anywhere on the level it is on.  no frustrations.  easy to set up and easy to link w other apps like spotify.
10672,2,i love my alexa!!
10673,1,works like a charm
10674,9,i am not a techy person so when i received one for christmas i thought what will l do with this? i am truly amazed . i set it up easily and daily have fun with it
10675,1,great fun and works well. we also control smart home devices. alexa is cool!
10676,14,"i thought that the sound quality would be bad. it is no top-end speaker,  but for something that sits on the kitchen counter and answers all of my mother is stupid questions, it is surprisingly good."
10677,10,"we enjoy our echo, weather, information and use it as a timer."
10678,12,love it!! perfect in playing musicwe use it everyday
10679,9,"i have them to six people for christmas and all are amazed. my 90 year old mom now has breakfast with drank sinatra, or steve lawrence with just one command"
10680,1,"listening to a variety of music, with excellent sound."
10681,10,what a wonderful addition to our kitchen - great sound and convenience with the skills and lists that alexa helps us with!
10682,10,it is the best thing i bought. i tell everyone to buy it. i do not even use my radio or cd
10683,14,"worked great for a gift, alexa app is glitchy as all get out though. product is awesome."
10684,11,love the sound better than the echo.
10685,1,love it! great sound and it looks good too!
10686,8,works great
10687,0,if i want more music choices i have to spend more money. all these devices sure nickels and dime you! and you have to download an app on a different device to make it work... bla bla bla
10688,14,"i gifted this to a friend, came pre-installed with my personal account, for some incredibly stupid reason... other than that, great sound."
10689,3,we love alexa.  does everything we expected.
10690,0,"i think it is a very good device, maybe even better when i learn it all has to offer."
10691,0,we find new uses every day. not sure about her occasional unsolicited comments however.
10692,4,easy to use set up in minutes
10693,12,we¡¯re loving it
10694,9,"could not be more satisfied with it. was a gift for a friend and was told it was the best one ever, funny how an electronic can turn into someone is new best friend lol"
10695,0,it sometimes does not respond and you need to have very specific questions. the jokes are and news updates are excellent
10696,14,"works great! i can now easily control smart devices with my voice. if i can get it to work with a roomba to get things from the fridge, i may never leave the couch."
10697,2,i love my new echo!
10698,12,we have fallen in love with the echo
10699,14,it keeps losing connection to my dish network got to redo it all the time so i just use my remote and do not mess with it. i just use it for music mostly
10700,11,much better music sound than our first one.

10704,0,we had music and i played it all the time through alexa. it was linked through our internet. then all of a sudden amazon want to make us pay! what kind of service is that? sounds great though.
10705,0,we love it!! i wish we could give her our own name!
10706,10,i love it!!! keeps me company when i am alone.
10707,7,it is very convenient i just ask alexa whatever i want. the sound is amazing i am glad i waited to get the 2nd generation echo i am very satisfied with my purchase <f0><u+009f><u+0092><u+009c><f0><u+009f><u+0092><u+009c><f0><u+009f><u+0092><u+009c><f0><u+009f><u+0092><u+009c><f0><u+009f><u+0092><u+009c><f0><u+009f><u+0092><u+009c><f0><u+009f><u+0092><u+009c><f0><u+009f><u+0092><u+009c><f0><u+009f><u+0092><u+009c><f0><u+009f><u+0092><u+009c>
10708,11,the sound is better
10709,0,a lot of questions i have asked  alexa  they do not have the answers. i do like that i can make a grocery list but it took forever to get my radio station.
10710,8,love it!
10711,0,i can play any songs or music i want. sometimes alexa does not comply or understand certain commands but over all i l love it. i need to learn more about her and and voice recognition

10716,1,awesome!
10717,12,"well, i have not got into it that much yet. but it is cool"
10718,10,"i like the fact that she can answer questions, especially measurements.  i wish her games were geared to more information from the 50 is and 60 is, i.e., music, trivia."
10719,0,echo is fun to play with but sometimes she does not respond
10720,9,incredible sound quality for such a small unit. wish i would have baught one for each room and skipped the dots.
10721,11,i love everything elsw about it beside that it didnt have much base like the plus. i hope it upgrade to have different voices.
10722,9,i love it so much i put them in every room
10723,10,"i love my amazon echo! i use it every single day whether it is to help me with school work, set a timer, play music and games, or even to give me a conversation starter!"
10724,9,thanks it is our third one!  great gifts!
10725,10,"user friendly is what we love the most, we are still learning how to use certain features like the music stations."
10726,10,i enjoy the ability to listen to the music of my choice instantly. i also check the weather before i go out. it is both fun and functional.
10727,0,i am learning more everyday. i do not like that i have everything i ask on my phone and only way to delete if one at the time.
10728,14,this echo (2nd gen ) is well worth the adding to my kitchen.great unexpected sound. now using it more often our bose. thanks amazon for your great products and personal tech support on them.
10729,9,"absolutely love it. it is my first one, my son has one and i decided to get one for myself. it does what is expected. i get my news, traffic, and weather reports in the morning before heading out."
10730,10,just getting used to alexa and the related products.. love it!
10731,4,"great sound, easy to use, integrates with iot devices well"

10734,11,"love it!  even better sound than the first echo i purchased, which was awesome in itself."
10735,3,love it!!!  works exactly like i hoped!!!  sound quality is amazing!!!
10736,9,all i know is that i¡¯m really happy that i bought this item.
10737,7,this little baby truly amazes me!  what sound quality !  and i am a snob about music clarity !  the only thing that disappoints me is that they can not be linked to another dot or echo!  <f0><u+009f><u+0091><u+008d><f0><u+009f><u+008f><u+00bb>
10738,10,"i am almost seventy years old and live alone- well with two dogs.  i appreciate how easy the echo is to set up, that it asks for nothing, and provides the music that i love and the answers i need"
10739,9,i love this so much! everyday use for everything! my dad liked it a lot too so he went and got himself one!
10740,1,the sound is  excellent
10741,11,"love it!  it has clear sound, great voice recognition, and stylish look -- gray fits my decor."

10743,0,like it a lot.
10744,14,"alexa echo is soothing - good companion - clear - knowledable - i love it/her!  bought two (2) for christmas gifts. thank you, amazon!  martha mcmahon, sun city, az."
10745,0,"every time you ask her to play music whether it is old or new it wants you to buy amazon music a month, also it dont give you the news or information you ask for, very disappointed!!!!"
10746,1,it is great!  has excellent sound quality and we are really enjoying it.
10747,3,performed as i expected
10748,9,awesome !!! would totally recommend!!
10749,0,good concept sound could be betterhad trouble setting upacts up from time to time ...if i have a radio station in and ask to turn volume up or down it turns off
10750,9,i love this and want more for each room.
10751,0,not for people who are clueless  like me
10752,9,we love this and plan to buy another soon.
10753,14,worked great. then suddenly stopped responding to anything. tried restarting the device and tried resetting it. nothing.
10754,5,"this was a gift for someone, they loved it."
10755,11,needs to be self powered and portable
10756,2,love it
10757,0,"i am really enjoying the new echo. i have noticed that you have to be very specific with your questions to get an answer. i¡¯m still learning what all the echo can do, but it is a lot of fun."
10758,14,not impessed with audio quality.  sent it back.
10759,0,"alexa can understand me very clearly, i rarely have to repeat myself. i do not like that the government is listening to me through this but what are you gonna do?"
10760,9,"bought for my brother as a christmas present.  he is not particularly electronically geared, although he thinks he is.  he was unable to sync it.  so he returned."
10761,0,"great sound quality, and no creepy laughter (yet). i hope the cia peeps listening in are enjoying the ridiculous questions i ask alexa, and the many inappropriate convos i have."
10762,2,love the new packaging
10763,8,"love it ,"
10764,11,i prefer the ring volume adjustment on 1.0 for smaller changes versus the push buttons on top.
10765,9,"if you are a electronic person like my boyfriend, you will love it too. helpful and easy to use"
10766,10,"i is great to keep me company, to hear the music and to get answers to questions when i am working."
10767,14,unable to access my song lists in spotify.  spoke to customer service more than once and there suggestions did not solve the problem
10768,13,amazing....greatest toy i ever had
10769,12,like everything.  dislike nothing!
10770,10,"the amazon echo is a great tool for accessing great music, questions, making lists and giving me reminders. the sound of this device is excellent and you can hear it from very clearly."
10771,3,"i received it as a gift from work, love it"
10772,0,computer
10773,1,"great product!!! i enjoy and use it daily. very unubtrusive, blends in amazingly."
10774,10,we really are having fun with echo. i especially like my shopping list!
10775,9,the echo is an excellent product. works great. after i tried mine out i bought 4 more as christmas gifts for my kids homes.
10776,10,we are really enjoying our echo.  it is so easy to get a quick answer on the weather each day and we love playing music.  just need to learn more about what she can do for us.
10777,11,sound may be a little better than the 1st generation.
10778,9,one of these is needed in every household!
10779,1,"easy to actually, good sound and very helpful"
10780,14,it is cool gadget just requires so many add ons to do things like an 150 dollar bridge to operate smart bulbs you have to enable everything you want you have to pay for spotify premium to use
10781,8,excellent
10782,9,we love the echo our kids got us for christmas. you can ask alexa to do so many for you it is amazing.
10783,11,"we love echo. we have an echo dot, an echo, and a plus. we love them all! and the walnut finish is a must."
10784,12,"great device and easy to setup, i still have not used a quarter of its capabilities yet. i am still learning about all of its capabilities. so far so good!"
10785,1,it is wondeful!
10786,10,we love our echo!!! we enjoy playing games with alexa and she informs us of breaking news & weather!!! she also helps with shopping!!
10787,14,it is the best thing since sliced bread. the entire family uses it. the two year old listens to the alphabets and the 70 year old listens to beethoven is 5th symphony.
10788,12,"excellent product!! still learning about its functions,but we enjoy it very much!"
10789,10,my husband is in love with  the music.we love it.
10790,11,i thought the sound was a bit better than the google device.unit very responsive even when i speak in a lower voice to givea command.  lots of options as far as music choices etc.
10791,4,very easy installation. great sound. easy operation
10792,10,i¡¯ve enjoyed listening to music. the sound is outstanding. it is quick and easy to set up. an interesting new dimension to life. highly recommend.
10793,10,"we love this talking encyclopedia/instant music/weather forecaster, etc. such a lazy, fast way to get information and hear tunes, and so much more!"
10794,10,"it is everything i thought it was, incredibly helpful and entertaining."
10795,10,"my husband  and i have been enjoying alexa very much. we can hear old songs, dance, and have fun with the silly jokes. we both listen to different music so it works well for us."
10796,0,"amazing product, i do,have a it of an accent but it gets everything."
10797,12,it is amazing how smart the echo can be.
10798,0,alexa is not doing so well to understand questions or request. limitations also to play music from my itunes.should be improve integration with other platforms.
10799,9,i got the echo for my husband in his garage. he loves it and enjoys it emensley. he loves the voice command ability and it saves him many steps to adjust the column.
10800,0,"still learning all of her capabilities. i love everything so far. sometimes she has trouble hearing me, but that could be a function if where i have her in the room."
10801,0,we do not like the fact that we can not use it on both phones.  we do not know whether or not it is peter is blackberry but nevertheless alexa just will not allow us to use both phones.
10802,14,i like this is very good in former play the songs you tell him to play i just want to see if you guys can improve to the next level i can wait for new things coming out of alex
10803,0,"i like it, however when playing music off of spotify it does not pick up where you left off on a playlist. also, it has been very difficult to connect to my internet connection."
10804,1,very good product extremely satisfied.
10805,1,just a great product.  good sound
10806,12,great product
10807,1,really cool item
10808,10,"we love our echo, my husband enjoys the music and i enjoy having alexa at any time."
10809,3,just works as advertised!
10810,10,"i got this because my grandsons would always grab my phone and ask it tons of questions and want music, set timers etc. i love it they love it ! still a lot to learn and try."
10811,11,the speaker quality is as good as my bose... love it so much!
10812,8,love it
10813,11,base is amazing for the size. definite must at the house.
10814,12,awesome product. i can not believe what this thing can do..
10815,1,it looks nice and works well like the other echo devices.
10816,5,this was purchased as a gift but they absolutely love it!
10817,14,"good speaker system, but overall the echo to me not worth the hype and purchase. i would gladly give it back for a refund."
10818,1,love the music !!
10819,0,i love it i can not make calls from alexa like it says
10820,3,omg i love this thing. makes life so much easier. fast shipping
10821,12,so far it is pretty cool but still learning all the different things alexa can do.
10822,11,when i bought it i was not expecting the sound quality that she has . i was very surprised and happy. granted it is not a huge stero system but you will be surprised.
10823,10,"we love our alexa! we use it for music, reminders,  timers and weather. we have not set up lights or anything else for it to control but we will be soon! love it!"
10824,14,just like google... it is however a good little speaker similar to a bose. i bluetooth my phone to it. i have slacker radio not specify or the others it supports
10825,0,"it is fun but not perfect.  often turns off when i use my iphone.  and, does not always answer the question... makes up some answer, even if i repeat the question."
10826,11,"great responses, but sound somewhat muffled and too soft if across the room.  alexa hears us  - difficult to hear her."
10827,3,alexa is just ok. i expected better but it was a gift so i will keep it.
10828,2,so far i love my echo.
10829,1,love it - we are having fun
10830,10,"plays most music i want.  answers most questions i ask.  have fun with it..  husband likes the music too,"
10831,9,loved the option of a monthly payment for this item. we have thoroughly enjoyed.
10832,12,it is exactly what i hoped it would be. i look forward to exploring all its uses.
10833,4,"love it, sound is excellent and easy to hook up!"
10834,14,i so enjoy it. i linked my sirius xm to it and it has a a superb sound . only downfall was when i unplugged to bring to another room it did not work until i unplugged it and re-plugged it in
10835,10,"great assistant, not as easy to get answers from on random stuff but still enjoyable, and helpful"
10836,9,"very handy, once i got my music set up"
10837,14,"great device, intercom function needs work. doesnt work well with backgroung noises."
10838,14,i am not computer illiterate but i found installation and set up very challenging and have really not been able to use it to it is fullest extent.
10839,10,"i like the way i can turn on my favorite music, instantly."
10840,0,came on time and was everything i expected!
10841,8,love it!
10842,1,excellent
10843,5,i bought it for my granddaughter and she loves it!
10844,0,i like the fact that you can ask alexa anything and get an answer. getting the weather forcast is my favorite. my least favorite thing is i can not get it to control everything
10845,14,"bought 6 of them as an alternative to sonos but system is not reliable, multi room capability sucks."
10846,9,"it delivers as promised. be careful, it is very addicting and easy to assimilate into your every day life!"
10847,5,got this as a last minute christmas gift for my mom and she loves it.
10848,0,the set-up was simple enough for me to do it myself.  it works just fine.
10849,10,love my alexa just need to talk clearly
10850,1,great product.  great for music and alexa.
10851,11,great improvement in sound quality especially in the lower frequencies.
10852,0,"i love listening to music.  with my echo, i do not have to keep changing cdcs.  i just listen. sometimes alexa does not know what i am askingbut most of the time i get what i want."
10853,0,alexa is my b now and she calls me daddy
10854,14,"i own a first generation echo purchased over a year ago (now being sold as the echo plus) which continues to impress me.  as a christmas gift i purchased a new echo for my wife to be used at home.  much to my surprise, the 2nd generation echo is a huge disappointment;  poor audio quality, tiny base, poor microphone pick-up and....surprisingly.... even the voice command logic seems to be less effective.  out of curiosity, i brought my 1st generation echo home from the office to compare side-by-side.  it would appear my suspicions were confirmed.  the 2nd gen echo is noticeably poorer quality option.  i am not an audiophile, nor a techie, but even i can notice the difference.  obviously,  amazon went cheap to lower the price-point.  if my wife has not already thrown out the box, i am intending to return it."
10855,8,love this! i use it everyday. it sounds great too.
10856,10,does it is job well and the kids love it. alexa has a sense of humor my fiance likes also. try asking her what the purpose of life is.
10857,11,the sound is excellent!  i¡¯ve heard others and there is no comparison to the echo!
10858,10,the echo was easy to set up and we really enjoy the various features.  every morning my young son asks for the day is weather report so he figure out which coat to wear!
10859,1,good sound and good look
10860,4,love this! easy setup. alexa is great.
10861,0,"i got this as a gift... i do not get it, honestly.... what does it do that siri does not do?!?!  does not seem worth it to me... it a glorified bluetooth speaker to me?"
10862,9,i love this product! it can literally do so many amazing things and i especially love listening to music on it! highly recommended!
10863,1,"i really love my echo speaker! it works very well, and the sound quality is amazing. it is definately worth the money."
10864,10,i received this as a gift from my son and love it. like to get my weather and calendar first thing in the morning. then my coffee and fabvotite music. many other features as well. dee rice
10865,11,"everything was perfect. love the volume buttons on this one, was not on the first generation....."
10866,0,i love that it can give me news reports and i can listen tomusic but i have to know the exact ch.of sirius that i want it to play and i¡¯m still not able to set alarm yet
10867,1,love this echo. it works great and has good sound quality.
10868,10,"absolutely love it. my son csn reach me from the other side of the house with the drop in skill. use the music, recipes, timers, alarms, games, so much to do!!"
10869,14,this echo is very good product i love it it is very good for the single men and women you never feel lonely you can speak to somebody always lol awesome product
10870,11,awesome sound! better than expected! i have to put it neck and neck with my bose sound system!
10871,1,love the rich sound quality of the dolby sound!  lots of fun to play around with and learn  very happy with it!
10872,10,i love her!  still so much to learn...i mainly use alexa for a radio with questions about today is weather and as a timer but can not wait to get some spare time to learn more!
10873,10,choice of music is nearly unlimited and am very impressed how quickly it responds to any requests. sound is excellent. we have 3 of them now.
10874,0,just wish alexa would not come on at every commercial that says her name!
10875,11,good
10876,9,"nice little gadget, but not if young ones are around. good sound speakers for playing music."
10877,10,the sound quality is awesome!  having music at a voice request is so convenient.
10878,10,it is so interesting to watch my kids play with alexa and ask her questions. it is almost more of a learning tool for them now than it is an entertainment device.
10879,10,we love all our alexa and dots!!  it is geen so fun automating our home!  tech support great and once you figure it all out it is so easy!!
10880,1,very fun
10881,11,smaller and just as good as original
10882,0,it is a waste of money.
10883,14,was delivered when expected. easy to set up and works fine.4  out of 5 because to get all the music they want you to sign up for amazon music.
10884,9,"this was a christmas gift to my son. he has had so much fun with this along with his children,  i am so happy i found something that would give them all so much fun & joy!"
10885,1,alexa is freakin awesome!
10886,0,it is a bit difficult to  connect to internet. need better directions on app.
10887,0,it needs to come with a manual and better instructions i am not all that impressed and  i tried to do research before i bought it  and i feel things could be more ecplainded about the item
10888,8,love it
10889,0,"we have not used it a ton but it is a fun toy and the kids love it.  the sound quality is better than i expected.  the only think i do not like, is that it does not have a rechargeable battery."
10890,10,"the sound is incredible,  alexa hears very well and is very smart.  i like listening to ""i heart radio"" and sunny radio.  however the directions on-line are not easy to use."
10891,0,i wanted more instructions about installing the echo along with some samples of how to use it.  i would like to know how to keep the music playing instead of turning itself off.
10892,4,confusing to set up but well worth the effort.  sound is amazing for such a smallpackage.
10893,14,"alexa is not the smartest girl.  i enjoy listening to ""ambient sounds: distant thunderstorms.""  but when i ask alexa to play it, she sometimes plays it together with a song from my music that i had played hours ago.  other times, alex would play a sample of distant thunderstorms from purewhitenoise.com.after going to alexa.amazon.com and providing feedback on whether alexa did what i want, i would have hoped alexa would do improve.i am happy with the sound quality, but i hope amazon improves alexa is intelligence."
10894,12,love learning more about what alexa can do each day
10895,1,works great !
10896,0,"i can play any music and the alarm set,"
10897,14,fine
10898,10,i love this echo it is so much fun and it made things so easier yes you can call me lazy but i do not mind thank you very much i love it
10899,10,i love the simplicity of the amazon echo. super easy to set up and use and great when cooking to set timers and not have to worry about touching a timer with raw meat hands.
10900,14,"ok, this is my second order of the echo 2nd generation hoping that my first one had a flaw.  i have updated the software as directed but the sound is still much less than i expected.  seems to be a common theme with the advertising of pretty much amazing sound.  anyway, both my first and now my second echo keeps stopping and starting....does not finish a sentence and my wifi is strong.  i have rebooted several times...not my internet connection.  anyone have any idea why it keeps stopping?"
10901,10,i like alexa now i do not forget things at the grocery store.
10902,14,a little tricky setup but when you figure it out it is absolutely great. some of the problems was caused by iphone operation system.
10903,14,i have one in every room and it helps o am handi capable and it makes me more independent with smart home capabilities.
10904,12,fun
10905,8,love it.  works great.
10906,0,works well for internet radio stations and has good sound
10907,14,"so far it is great, the issue is ""i am old school"", i can not wait to get her hooked up with my tv and some of the other devices in my home"
10908,9,love it!  now it is alexa everything in my house.
10909,14,"mine arrived yesterday. hesitated buying one because of reviews on poor sound quality. not true, sound is great. this thing is really neat. i¡¯d recommend purchasing it."
10910,1,sound quality is quite good for this size.  alexa works really well.
10911,11,i love the echo. it is easy to use and the speaker has strong volume and fine sound.
10912,13,neatest gadget i ever bought.
10913,10,the music is fantastic!! i¡¯m really enjoying getting to know alexia. amazon updates on how to use her is a great tool
10914,9,i bought each of my family an echo for christmas last year and they all loved them. my brother returned the favor this year and i have used it every day.  absolutely love it.
10915,12,still not the greatest product. limited to what you can do
10916,0,does everything expected!  but for some reason alexa scares my cat.... any other music is fine but if you ask alexa to sing a song my cat runs and hides!  lol
10917,14,love the sound and ease of use.  unlike the google mini which i rec would a a gift. you can disconnect the echo to move to another room and  not have to reprogram
10918,11,the sound is amazing!  can not believe the quality coming from such a small area!
10919,10,i enjoy the clear soft sound. i am amazed at the quick response of my requests!
10920,14,"at first it seemed great.  now,  it is been cutting out in the middle of a song."
10921,12,have not found much use for it yet!
10922,10,i love it. there is so much you can do with the echo. i just received the dot and am so excited to continue to add things and make my home ¡°smart¡±.
10923,11,the sound on its own is amazing but when it is paired with my jbl speaker the whole house sounds great.
10924,12,received this as a gift so had no expectations- and am very pleased with the sound quality.
10925,12,love the echo but have not figured out all the options.
10926,14,"if you do not have one, you need to get one! it is great"

11031,14,i love it! took a while to get it connected to wifi and had to call customer support but they were beyond helpful. on the phone for an hour. amazing help and it is a great device
11032,5,gave this to my niece for her birthday.  she loves it!thank you.
11033,14,"i love this product , specially having a prime account with music and books it is a must. i tried a few months ago google home and returned it, echo is far better."
11034,1,"love the new size, great sound from a tiny tube."
11035,12,i am still learning how many things alexa can do!!!
11036,10,"i enjoy getting radio stations from around the country, but it does not play very loud. we¡¯ve had some fun playing games and it makes it really easy to get the weather forecast."
11037,0,there are quite a few times where alexa does not quite understand what i am saying and she does not hear me throughout the whole house i have to scream at times to get her to work
11038,14,this product has lived up to all the advertisement and expectations. it is great on so many levels. i could not be more pleased with this purchase.
11039,10,"alexa is awesome! she keeps us up on the news, weather, and fulfills all our music needs! great sound"

11041,0,its great. three thumbs up
11042,14,i love alexa !! everything is going ok. so smart yo control.home devices.the things that i am waiting for is that can talk in spanish soon.
11043,11,"like i said about the remote, echo is a great instrument to have."
11044,10,i love my echo. alexa reminding my pills every day. and put my favorite music. and say me alot the question the i doing to her.
11045,8,love it!
11046,0,the sound is great! alexa responds when you say alexa then ask/direct alexa what you want. would recommend this to anyone looking to purchase.
11047,1,works great. sounds very good when playing music
11048,4,easy setup. looks sharp.
11049,0,she answers sometimes to what is being said on the tv.
11050,0,perhaps i am not using it to its capacity. mostly use it as a timer
11051,14,great device! excellent sound quality and great microphones! my one complaint is it should work with other music services!
11052,0,i did not like that it does not have spanish as a language
11053,8,love it
11054,0,i enjoy being able to just speak a question or command and alexa complies. it was a little frustrating at first to get the echo to connect to our playlists in our phones
11055,1,great sound
11056,9,received this as a gift. i really have enjoyed it. i also have a dot and set it in a group so i can enjoy on both ends of my house.
11057,10,"i really like that amazon sends me tips on new/different things to try with alexa.  we actually purchased the items to have alexa to control the lights.  this was a great holiday gift,"
11058,9,got this as a gift for my birthday but we love playing music and playing games and turning on and off the lights with it. definitely worth the money if your thinking about getting one.
11059,14,did smart home setup myself.  integrated well with my configuration!
11060,0,alexa can never answer my questions.  she seems to be just an expensive speaker.
11061,10,"love how i can set up list, reminders play trivia, listen to music, get weather and traffic."
11062,11,better sound in a smaller package.
11063,3,"i have nothing negative to say, it is awesome!!"
11064,14,kick ass speakers.  i have 500 dollar bowers and wilkins t5 speakers and these sound almost as great plus alexa is awesome with spotify and hue light control.
11065,8,love it!
11066,14,love it but had some serious set up issue with my router. was on the verge of sending back. also would like to have more then one option to play music from.
11067,10,my family enjoys using the echo. we use it for learning and for relaxation time.
11068,1,superb gizmo with useful features and finally reasonably priced.
11069,10,"alexa echo is great!  we ask questions occasionally, but we use it mostly for playing our favorite music."
11070,8,awesome
11071,0,we like the wide selection of misic available and size of the unit.we do not like the fact that the timer volume is too quiet and can not be adjested to a louder volume.
11072,0,"it worked good for 1 month.  now we hear alot ""im having problem understanding. try again later."""
11073,14,"works well, pretty good sound. has issues staying attached to phone bluetooth but that could be my issue."
11074,10,"the echo is so fun and very useful. we use it daily playing music, jeopardy, and just having fun with it. can not wait to buy another to connect then throughout the house."
11075,12,love it but still in the learning process
11076,11,love it. it does all that i expect and i love the smaller design
11077,14,"simple instructions, easy to setup, and works as advertised.  i wish everything i bought fell into this category."
11078,9,"the echo was an unexpected christmas gift, i would never have purchased this for myself.  however, i enjoy having this device on my counter and listen to the radio constantly."
11079,10,i liked the availing to hear me even when i was super far from it. although i do not use it that often based on my needs for it. i got it as a present so i use it occasionally.
11080,10,"love it! it is great to request whatever music i want. also i get to listen to a radio station from buffalo, where we use to live. it is a good talk show that i always enjoyed."
11081,10,i like that it will my favorite music and has such a nice tone.
11082,14,not enough included with prime for echo had to buy extra package love music but felt add on should have been cheaper
11083,10,"how easy it is to set up and use. it provides a wide variety of uses, information and entertainment."
11084,0,it is ok and gets the job done but.does not hear that great.
11085,14,i am truly amazed at what alexa and my echo can do. coming from 8 track stereos and then having the first pioneer supertuner cassette at my school to this is beyond words. bravo amazon.
11086,10,we love the music quality and mobility.  we also like her good morning facts and instant weather.we would like to name her something other than the choices given.
11087,9,"the product works great, and i got it for $84.99! great price!"
11088,0,really enjoying it.  the one reason i did not give it five stars was becausei thought alexa  might be able to answer more questions like siri does on my iphone.
11089,10,love the ease of use. looking forward to purchasing several more for each room!
11090,11,works great. definitely can tell it has more microphones than previous version.
11091,1,works great - like having a frind
11092,10,fun and easy to use. everyday we learn something new to ask it. love being able to turn on house lights using alexa.
11093,11,"we are having lots of fun with the echo 2nd generation! although i was expecting better sound quality, she still sounds great!"
11094,11,"great speaker system, wonderful sound.  a little trickery to use than expected but not bad overall."
11095,1,we love alexa and are pleased with the sound quality
11096,1,the echo 2nd generation was easy to install; sound is excellent.
11097,10,i love purchasing robots.  i hate that i do not owe more.
11098,14,"great addition to my smart home, allows me to control multiple items without needing a phone or tablet!"
11099,10,i love asking her for the news in the morning.  she plays all the music i have requested so far.  i can call my friends and family with her.  i am still learning what things i can do.
11100,10,i have thoroughly enjoyed my echo.  it is convenient and saves me time.  i need to go buy more smart devices for the home so i can play with other features and benefits it offers.
11101,10,whole family loves the things that echo can do!  nice to listen to music in the morning instead of bad news on tv - and you can ask for weather report and get right back to music
11102,10,like the home functions and news briefing. skills are entertaining.
11103,5,i ordered this for my son for christmas. he is in college. he loved it. very nice to have.
11104,14,"i placed it centrally located, not near any walls.  i need to either scream, or get right up on it in order for it to acknowledge me when i am playing music"
11105,10,i really love being able to just say alexa play and then choose whatever music i am in the mood for. so far that is about all i have done.
11106,0,great!  the only problem is that too many times alexia tells me she is having problems accessing the internet.
11107,8,excellent product
11108,9,"i love it and so does my grandkids! i think its the best thing ever, i really want one for 2 more rooms."
11109,10,"a lot of fun! it is used for weather reports, ballgame scores, music, general information and much more."
11110,14,arrived on time and as stated!
11111,11,great sound and form factor
11112,0,i am having problems with it just shutting off in the middle of the songs! it happens at least 3 times in a half hour .
11113,10,i love that i can ask it questions i love that i can ask it what time stores are open and closing i love it when she plays music for us we bought the buttons and i just love the games
11114,0,"while alexa is very good for things like playing music, giving you current weather and such she is not so quick or helpful with answers to questions,like from a crossword puzzle."
11115,8,love it
11116,14,"the sound quality is amazing. i took it on vacation with me to mexico and it took a few minutes to sync it up with the hotel wifi, but then worked like normal."
11117,10,"i love alexa!! whatever music i want, whenever i want! best thing ever invented!!"
11118,0,better results from siri.does not recognize all song.needs a lot of work.giving 2 stars is a gift;
11119,12,i like everything i know about alexa so far. there is more to learn i¡¯m sure. i mostly use it for music and jeopardy.
11120,14,"takes time to determine what you want alexa to do regularly. loaded and unloaded several of her apps before we got the right mix. she is our favorite ai. sound is great,"
11121,4,it was very easy to setup. voice recognition works superbly and the sound quality is far better than expected from such a small unit.
11122,9,love it! we own several echos and this one is just as great as the others!
11123,14,the sound was better than expected. but i¡¯m disappointed in the simple task alexa can not do like set repeat alarms.
11124,11,"we like the echo, but wonder why it does not have a battery pack?  we use our 1st generation much more often.  the (possibly) improved sound does not make up for the lack of flexibility."
11125,12,so far i love my echo!!  its fun learning new things she can do ...
11126,0,"i like you can ask it most anything and it give you a answer. sometimes it will not work, it does not last long. but overall i like."
11127,3,works as advertised.
11128,14,absolutely love it! sounds better than my normal speakers!
11129,14,"love the rapid response & music availability.  have to be careful if we mention her name in a conversation, though.."
11130,14,echo is very nice. my kids love it. looking forward most to seeing where this technology takes un in the future.
11131,1,"we are very happy with alexa! very entertaining & informative, and great sound from such a compact, almost ""invisible"" appliance.thanks, alexa!"
11132,11,this was a replacement for a 1st generation echo and i gave it 4 stars since the voice recognition is not as good as the 1st generation - we have to repeat multiple times.
11133,12,so far no problems she is new and so we¡¯ve been exploring on what it can do and so far have been impressed.
11134,11,powerful little speaker. sounds beautiful at full volume with no distortion.
11135,1,"very fun and useful, enjoying this product and would recommend"
11136,10,"this thing is awesome! serves as a family intercom, music source, and information source every day."
11137,9,we thoroughly enjoy this product!!
11138,14,great sound and over quality but the alexa app on iphone is very clunky as of the latest update. with software updates coming soon i hope to have better integration
11139,0,"sound it great but she is stupid, even commands she knows and has done several time, she will say she does not understandvery frustratingi wish i had gotten the google one"
11140,10,this was a gift and i love it. the sound is great when playing music and the timer function is helpful when cooking multiple things at the same time.
11141,11,doesnt sound much better than a dot.
11142,14,love the echo 2.... the features and functionality its a game changer.  it is help me increase my productivity and brings me a true amount of joy.  where have you been all my life.
11143,0,i think the music bank the most..... it does not understand us a lot of times. a little hard to understand. i wish i had more info about how to use the best...
11144,10,very fun. we like to play trivia and games with it. it will give me a compliment if i ask for it.  tells us time and weather. i also use it for an alarm clock.
11145,12,love it. i use it mostly for music. the sound production is good. i intent to explore all of its capabilities to sync with the television etc.
11146,10,alexa is part of my morning christmas. thanks to amazon for making a great product.
11147,11,the sound is greatly improved.  i miss the sound control that is on the original echo.
11148,10,i love this product!  so fun to use.  i mainly use it for music but love the trivia and games.  well worth the purchase!
11149,10,"the amazon echo has superior quality and i love the variety of music. alexa will give you the weather, recipes and any information you¡¯re looking for!! amazing! love it!!"
11150,10,do not like it all. invention of what is going in my home
11151,10,"when i ask alexa to play radio station wmal, alexa plays wml, and assumes i meant w, m, and a l, so i say ""wmal skills,"" instead, and that works."
11152,1,was impressed with the sound when playing music...very happy with this purchase
11153,1,i love my echo. alexa is very entertaining and useful. i got the wood finish - it looks the picture and is very nice looking.
11154,11,i like the new size of the unit and the sound has a more forward bass sound.great sound for the money.
11155,1,"amazing device! sound quality is second to none and was an amazing addition to the home! i¡¯d recommend to anyone whos looking for a smart home upgrade, music all around smart appliance!"
11156,14,i like the reminders from alexa rather than having to type them in a calendar.
11157,14,received echo as holiday gift. very easy to set up with my mac and iphone.  was pleasantly surprised with the strong and clear sound quality! still exploring all the other features!
11158,2,absolutely love my echo!
11159,2,i love my amazon echo ( alexa ) !
11160,14,i play music mostly on the echo and find the amazon song playlist a little frustrating on their selections i want to play.james dunn
11161,14,i liked the abundance of skills of the device and the sound fidelity. i found the installation instructions to be difficult and i had to go to google several times to get help.
11162,8,i love it!
11163,5,gave t my granddaughter and one for my daughter for christmas and they both love them.
11164,10,"easy to use. i enjoy the music everyday and the versatility of the recipes, helpful hints,ect. the uses are endless."
11165,1,love the color and the sound of the echo is amazing!!!
11166,0,"i absolutely love it,i love how fast and easy it is,it can not understand some of the names i pronounce but hell neither can i lol"
11167,11,much better sound.
11168,0,"it is a pretty decent unit,the sound could be a little better but all in all i would recommend it to other people, it definitely has it is useful qualities"
11169,14,needs more music available without going to pay site
11170,11,the sound is equal to the price; good but not as good as the original echo. nice size and very good voice response.
11171,1,good product... sounds great !!!
11172,9,i absolutely love her!!!
11173,11,the sound out of the speakers is great!  i had both the older echo and the new playing and the difference is noticeable to even an untrained ear.  would definitely recommend to my friends.
11174,14,unable to play radio station i request after enabling the skill for it. it either starts to play and in about 2 minutes it turns off and will not come back on or it will not play at all.
11175,11,love it!  this is an upgrade from the dot.
11176,10,"the echo has a great rich sound, and the easy verbal access to all it features makes life a bit easier."
11177,1,sound is great!
11178,4,very easy to use and helpful.
11179,10,we love our alexa ... the music is great ... my favorite is being able to make my shopping  list ... i never get to the store without a list now !!!
11180,7,"i like that it plays music from any time period and genre. plus she tells funny jokes and plays games, but i still have a lot to learn.<f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+008a>"
11181,1,"it is not at 100%efficiency yet but, really useful and good !"
11182,1,love it nice looking and grate sound perfect sizes
11183,9,we bought the echo dot first and loved it so much that we had to buy a echo 2nd generation! we are learning more and more things about alexa is capabilities and love them!
11184,9,great sound for such a small unit. wife listens to it in the kitchen when she is cooking. she loves it.
11185,11,this is an excellent upgrade.  the sound is significantly better!!
11186,0,dosen' t work all the time (correctly).
11187,14,"great sound and recognizes wide range of accents.  perfect for an older person who is frustrated by technology,"
11188,10,"easy setup, great technology with great options for in home use, including fun activities"
11189,9,purchased as a gift for my brother. he loved it so much he purchased one for each room in his house.
11190,10,i enjoy the convenience of just talking instead of looking for information on the internet.i enjoy music when i want and improving my vocabulary
11191,0,"it is alright. sounds great for music purposes, it is not very knowledgeable, if u ask it a question it dosent know 90 percent of what you ask it, not like the google home"
11192,14,works amazing.  i can not use it tho since i live in an appartment and even on the lowest setting the inproved speaker sound goes right through the walls.
11193,0,it works very well... still does not understand all phrases...
11194,9,"i also have an echo dot, so now i have one on each floor.  love the great speakers on the big one."
11195,14,great product.  only issue i have is that it has frozen up a couple of times.  not enough to worry about (i think too many people were talking at once in my home and it got confused).
11196,11,echo was more useful than i expected!... i find something new everyday!
11197,10,my daughter loved it so i am very happy. great sound and the various functions make it a great buy.
11198,1,the sound is incredible!
11199,10,"ease of setup, ease of use, being able to verbally set timers and alarms, being able to get news and radio stations. i can play my stored music as well as sirius and amazon."
11200,14,"now i have a smart, funny,new g.f. to talk."
11201,3,i love it sound is great even has bass to it i do not know how i lived without this product !!!
11202,2,the sound is awsome
11203,10,love it!  i really like that i can ask it to add items to my shopping list. all i need to do is tap the icon at the store and it pulls up my list for me.  nice feature.
11204,1,"good product, it is a lot of fun to use"
11205,1,great product
11206,8,love it
11207,1,"the sound is amazing, clear, and loud!easy set up, new exterior looks elegant !"
11208,9,i love my echo and echo dot.  how did we get along without them.
11209,14,"the real fun is when an alexa commercial comes on the tv. granted, there is the option to change the ""name ' of your device, but alexa works for us."
11210,12,"works very well for quick weather & news updates, pandora, and ordering ubers. i still need to learn it is other capabilities but have enjoyed it so far."
11211,12,the best!!
11212,14,"these are great! i have 3, in different areas of the house."
11213,11,i really like the powerful sound that comes from it but for some reason it has started to crackle a bit from some of the bass...otherwise i love it!
11214,1,it is a neat thing to have! i love using it for music!!
11215,1,sound is amazing
11216,14,it is hard to even begin to describe how cool this tiny gizmo is.i¡¯ll rather say it just works.it is like a product made by apple during the late naughties/early 2000s.
11217,0,i do not like that it records everything you ask it on the alexa app on your phone.
11218,9,love the great sound it has for my music. the only thing i did not like was it did not  in sync with the echo dot
11219,0,i really like the large variety of skills she has.  i have a little bit of trouble figuring out how to get my favorite music to come up.  i hope to get it figured out soon.
11220,14,it was difficult for me to set up. setup needs to detect more detailed information about the system and/or smartphone you are using and then provide more instruction.
11221,10,i love being able to ask alexa to play a certain song i want to hear.  my grandchildren had a great time with minethen i gave them one for each of their houses and they love it.
11222,10,i like it a lot exceeded my expectations
11223,10,love it. very entertaining. lol
11224,14,love my new amazon echo (2nd generation.  shipment arrived quickly with no wait.  easy to set-up.  sounds terrific.  i may order another one for multiple room listening.
11225,4,i love my echo! the sound is wonderful. set up was easy and it is lots of fun to use.
11226,14,everything except i have to buy smart plugs and smart bulbs to really help me daily..
11227,10,i love alexa. i ask her all sorts of things. from the weather to translations. thanks
11228,3,excellent product.  price was great! would buy again!
11229,0,love her music.  kind of stupid.  really have to lead here when asking here to think.  she would rather not commit to an answer
11230,2,i got echo new generation i love it
11231,5,my son will love his christmas present.
11232,14,it works well. the integration in to smart hubs and bulbs is really cool.
11233,8,i love this!!
11234,1,great device.
11235,1,love it. has very nice sound quality.
11236,14,"so far so good, i am enjoying my relationship with alexa. i will let you know any iota of discontent i may develop or find in the future."
11237,12,my husband loves this item and he is still learning what it all it can do! it is like a cool toy!
11238,11,great sound and much better looking than the first gen echo. latest firmware update really improved the sound.
11239,1,"it is fun to use, helpful, and very responsive"
11240,14,not as quite as easy to connect but works well when tied to my other echo devices.
11241,8,love it!
11242,1,music sounds great
11243,10,i enjoy the sound and music available! it has good volume and looks nice. the kids like to play with it too and stay occupied for hours!awesome!
11244,14,freaking awesome
11245,14,decent sound but often falls out of sync with other devices.
11246,14,"did not think i¡¯d use it much, but alexa is now a true bestie"
11247,14,love that it even recognized obscure bands....here come the mummies for example....a bit difficult to set up at first.
11248,9,loving and enjoying my very own alexa.
11249,10,nice listening to sirius and pandora on.
11250,14,plays music answers almost everything you need to know.  sits on our kitchen counter open concept can hear music everywhere.  only problem is it cuts out from time to time.
11251,14,"funny when a commercial comes on the television for this product. the ad says. ¡°alexia..do this.. and ours at home, lights come on and asks what exactly we wanted. lol"
11252,1,the sound is really good.
11253,14,"good at the easy stuff , but can not answer abstractions or more obscure information. depends heavily on wikipedia."
11254,1,"great sound, looks good"
11255,0,it does not know the answer to most of my questions and does not do anything i hoped it would.
11256,0,like the large library  of music. dislike  it repeats  a lot of songs. dislike that it does not  reconiz e commands all the time.
11257,2,i love everything about my amazon echo! soooo glad i got one.
11258,7,it is so easy to navigate and so much fun talking to alexa <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+008a>
11259,8,love it!
11260,2,love my echo!
11261,14,"i am having a problem connecting two echo dot , the one that is working i can not live without, great...and if i can get the echo 2nd generation working it would be great...."
11262,12,"i really like this! having a lot of fun with alexia, she is a hoot."
11263,1,love the finish and it is s very nice speaker
11264,10,great product! love that it will make lists for me! music sounds great with this speaker
11265,14,i am replacing this product to give it a second chance. my first echo after 1.5 hour talk with representative could not connect to my smart tv(. alexa is going back to amazon...
11266,14,"still learning what alexa can do, but safe to say sound quality--esp. base range-- much improved"
11267,8,love it!
11268,8,love it!
11269,0,we are enjoying it but have two plugs that we would like to use upon alexis command but have not figured it out.
11270,14,"the best of the similar devices that i have tried. (siri, cortana) ok as a speaker, if you are looking for great sound i would get the dot and connect to a better speaker."
11271,6,sketchy stuff goin on when doin network com monitoring on it
11272,0,"i find the alexa voice a bit hard to understand.. it helps somewhat to switch it to a british accent. unlike siri, you can not switch alexa to a male voice"
11273,14,sad that there isnt a battery pack for the gen 2 to make it portable/wireless.....otherwise we love it....great sound quality for such a small device.
11274,14,"sound is just as good as my previous one.  takes longer to respond, but the worst part is no charger.  it has tone plugged everywhere it is being used!"
11275,0,"i like that i can have music anywhere i  like, and any time, and if i have a puzzling question i can get a quick answer. so far i have not found anything i do not like about echo!"
11276,4,"the sound quality is great,  easy set up and installation, the app is good. so far we are happy."
11277,0,i love it. i guess there is controversy about privacy and security. after some research i was still confused. i unplug it if i¡¯m not using it. an abundance of caution.
11278,1,great sound good product
11279,10,absolutely love it!  we have so much fun cleaning to music!!
11280,10,i like listening to music and also using it for lights being turned off and on. also ordering things from amazon.
11281,0,"i like the ease at which i can access music and information. the sound is amazing. however, i have not found anything not to like. love it>>>>love it"
11282,1,awesome
11283,10,"being a senior, i like the ability to ask every day, what day it is and the weather.  i like listening to my music.  i am sure i will find other uses."
11284,14,"echo will not come on. looking for technical support is terrible.  there are no easy links to troubleshoot.  it will not even reset, just stopped coming on?"
11285,3,"so far itt work ok, but i have not had it very long."
11286,14,"sound quality is very clear and good.  however, type of music can be played without purchasing is very limited, some of the functions are difficult and confusing while setting up."
11287,14,"love alexa!  i do not have a mobile phone.  initially, it was difficult finding the link for the set up app."
11288,11,"the sound is not great, expecting a better sound of this system."
11289,9,love it!  ordering echo show....
11290,10,"excellent new echo, it is so handy when we are running out the door.  we ask, what is the weather forecast?  it is such a convenient toy."
11291,14,still trying to see how i can use all features.  associate multiple devices and sync with other rooms.  but mainly satisfied.
11292,9,bought 2 of these for my home along with light bulbs and outlets and thermostat. this echo works everything and is pretty much a personal assistant and entertainer.
11293,14,love! the only thing i wish amazon would update is that the speaker completely does not work not even with the aux cord if it is not connected to wifi.
11294,0,having issues with alexa understanding me. i am annunciating clearly but getting incorrect responses. will do voice training again and see if that helps
11295,0,"need to play with more,  but so far it just stops playing music often and does not seem to connect to our firestick which is the whole reason we got it."
11296,9,"bought this for my living room and an echo dot for my bedroom. loved it so much, i bought 2 more dots as christmas presents."
11297,10,i like it a lot. it is entertaining and very useful.
11298,14,have enjoyed my new echo. it loses xinnext more than i would like. has lasp of memory also. i would also like to know what type of aux cord is needed to  hook up to and amplifier.
11299,12,sounds good. still getting used to it. like it!
11300,1,works great
11301,0,can not get it to answer most if the time. a waste.
11302,10,"love saying alexa, good morning and learning a bit of history.  love asking for whatever music i want to hear.  just love it!!!"
11303,3,sounds good!  i like it much!
11304,12,we absolutely love alexa!  so helpful with many aspects of day to day life!
11305,14,i like my alexa it was fairly easy to set up. my favorite feature thus far is that i can she can start my car. can not wait to order another one for my mom
11306,12,"got this as a gift and i love it!!!  still got a lot to learn, but great product!!!"
11307,0,"we love alexa.  mostly i listen to music, but she is good for other info as well. eventually we will probably use more features, like turning on and off lights, etc."
11308,12,"this thing is completely addictive. it makes you lazy, but it is a hoot. we are enjoying the heck out of it!"
11309,5,given as a gift.........they loved it!!!
11310,10,so easy to set up and use. love playing the different genres of music.  grandson loves playing games with alexa.
11311,10,i love this thing!  it met and exceeded all expectations.  really wish i had one for every room!
11312,10,pandora radio is available for free listening.
11313,9,great product for seniors!
11314,9,our first experience with an echo.  what more could we want.  love it.
11315,10,"i was a little skeptical, but we love our echo. works with smart plugs to turn lamps off and provides information and music at a verbal request."
11316,8,love it
11317,10,easy to use for instant answers to questions without looking them up on the computer.
11318,1,the echo is great !! the sound is fantastic with great bass response. overall a great product.
11319,9,i bought it as a gift for my step son. we all use it and love it.
11320,11,"love this new toy.  sound could be better, but appropriate for the price."
11321,1,the speaker has great sound quality!
11322,0,"it is fun and helpful...when it works, which it often does not.  too often, alexa tells me that she does not understand, and to try again later.  i am not terribly impressed."
11323,14,it is very convenient. and getting even more so as i learn all alexa can do. and all the secondary functions when owning things that pair like the nest. or doorbell ring.
11324,1,works great
11325,0,have to ask questions many different ways to get right answers. some times i will ask for something alexa played for me one day but cant seem to find it the next time i ask.
11326,0,it is always on point. when you ask her something she almost always has the answer. i would be nice if she was a little more personable.
11327,0,very happy and enjoying and learning!devices seem to be getting smarter than us for sure!
11328,14,"does not work, i try to connect via wifi in usa and impossible to make it work. not easy.... maybe something wrong with this purchase¡×..."
11329,10,easy to use. i like it for staying on top of the news and weather in the morning and for playing my favorite music the  rest of the day.
11330,5,i bought this for my husband and son and they both love it
11331,14,"pros:- way better sound quality and volume than previous generations- i am a heavy home automation user, echo does a good job of adding voice commands to my hubs- extensive list of compatible devices- adds new functions pretty consistentlycon:- alarm clock features! these features seem very basic to me as there are multiple smart alarm clocks on the market today that do this (as well as the echo competitors). this has been a common complaint of the echo for years.  - i want my alarm to wake me up to music (amazon music, pandora, spotify, whatever).  - i also want to be able to increase the brightness of my smart lights through the alarm, my alexa can already control my  lights via voice... why not via time?  - i was expecting the new spot to add this functionality (since it is literally marketed as a fancy alarm clock), but it is still  missing!seems a bit nitpicky i know... but it is a big deal to me. if it is to you too, you might want to investigate some of the echo competition since they all have this ability. if this one flaw is not an issue, you will be very happy with it!"
11332,9,i finally found a woman who listens to me.
11333,14,after a couple months it quit working and now it still not working after being on the phone with amazon tech support and my internet provider for over 2hrs
11334,0,i do not like that i have to download apps to  do all the functions .  you cannot just ask questions and get answers like google without downloading apps  .
11335,14,like the improved sound quality.  you should allow a trade in value for the older products so your loyal customers are more motivated to upgrade upgrade.
11336,5,this is a gift for a friend
11337,10,we love it!! we learn more everyday!  we also appreciate your emails of new ideas :)
11338,14,bought it for my father who has micro-degeneration and is now considered legally blind. he can no longer use his desktop and this has been a wonderful alternative!
11339,3,works and sounds great!!! would buy again and more of them.
11340,12,works great as all our alexis devices do.  got this one at christmas time 2017.  so not much history yet but so far so good.  no complaints.
11341,10,"we like every about the eco, i especially the quality of music. i am a musician and the quality of music coming from that unit is amazing, i love it,"
11342,14,wish they were metal
11343,1,love it. was shipped quickly and setup was a breeze
11344,14,can not get skills to work.  i can stream spotify but not have it run locally on alexa.  its really difficult to get set up i guess.
11345,12,all i can say this has cganged my life and home. i look forward to adding more accessories.
11346,3,really thought i did not need this but i was wrong!
11347,0,i like the ease of speaking to it and the instant response. what i do not like is that it shuts off so easily without my wanting it to.
11348,10,"she still does not know me...(voice recognition) but i am enjoying her ability to play music, a meditation, and the news with a verbal request."
11349,14,amazing£¬perfect if it can support chinese.
11350,14,the echo has been as advertised!
11351,1,"completely satisfied, sound is awesome. love it."
11352,1,great little speaker!
11353,10,good
11354,10,"i love my alexa, my family has fun with her and the fact that i can talk to family from other states with alexas is a plus."
11355,9,my first experience. use it a lot. will probably get another for bedroom.
11356,14,"not quite cerrain why it is not working properly but it is been skipping and actually staticy the last three days,but we did love it the first couple days"
11357,2,i love everything about my echo
11358,14,i am a fan!!
11359,10,i love the ability to listen to the music i love with just voice commands.
11360,10,love it!  i can now listen to the radio stations that i have not been able to with a radio.  i love the ability to make a list for the store and also the set the timer.
11361,1,"it awesome and tons of fun,!"
11362,14,works well but with the hue lights it can make a mistake from time to time
11363,10,i really love it! it is fun to use. the only downfall is it seems to have a hard time with some questions that seem easy. it is a learning curve for the both of us!
11364,1,awesome!!!
11365,1,dolby sound makes alexa an awesome ai mechanisism.
11366,14,honestly worth it just for the amazing speaker quality that i do not even need to connect my phone to more than once to use
11367,0,"i am a music freak and i love this, do not have to stop what i am doing to pick a song, just keep going."
11368,14,gift
11369,9,fun product. makes interacting with it fun and the answers are spot on
11370,12,i love my echo. the sound is outstanding and it takes so little space.
11371,0,"you have to ask the questions just the right way to get an answer, otherwise you get an ""i do not know"" or something different."
11372,1,sound is great. manual is lacking.
11373,10,i love it! works just the way i expected! my girls love asking it jokes and playing all their favorite songs!
11374,8,"we love it, speaker is great!"
11375,14,we integrated smart plugs and lights into the echo and we are impressed with how it functions.pronunciation of some words can cause confusion with the echo.
11376,12,so far so good. still learning about all the things i can do with it.
11377,14,i can not think of a more useful item to have.  i am going to get a few more for other rooms in the house and shop.  a+++ amazon way to go!
11378,14,the ease of use and the quality of sound just can not be beat! it is wonderful!!!!
11379,5,having a blast with it.  love it much!!
11380,14,"i did not like the difficulty in putting it in use, and unexpected the need for pandora set up,  other than that i really like it"
11381,0,i can call it from a distance and it will follow my instructions. but if you do not pronounce her name correctly she will not responds
11382,14,"from the always on-demand music to the ever growing skills, the echo 2 just gets better. the speaker is more than adequate and on par with our bose mini sound dock."
11383,0,it does have a decent sound but it does not understand a lot of things you have to work on ways to phrase things to get it to understand
11384,10,having a ball with it not a necessity but is fun going to get a couple more
11385,0,think it could be a little more  sensitive to voice recognition when its all the way up you have to get up on it in order for it to hear  your commands.
11386,9,love my echo.  amazed what it can do.  alexa and i are very good friends!
11387,10,was a gift and i love it. i love being able to ask for songs i have not heard in years and it is playing. no negative comments
11388,1,it is fun!
11389,9,i bought this product as a christmas gift for our grandson and he really enjoys the echo 2nd gen.
11390,12,"sound is great, but still learning its capabilities"
11391,10,"ordered as a christmas gift for my husband...love it!  impressed by how quickly the request is delivered - whether it be music, weather report, etc."
11392,9,"love my echo,  sounds excellent. looks great too. alexa does it all and answers all our questions.  this is the coolest technology ever!"
11393,1,great product! fun and educational to have around.
11394,4,"great sound, easy to use!"
11395,11,i love it. it is beautiful and woks perfectly. it seems to be much better about catching my commands over the music when the volume is set fairly loud.
11396,4,great
11397,8,love love love
11398,10,"excellent sound. love music fearure. very handy e.g. shopping lists.everyone loves it...us, adult kids, grandkids."
11399,10,"love, love, love this echo!  the kids love asking her questions and we play music all the time.  the speaker is amazing!"
11400,11,"i like my first generation better. this sounds ok, but my first gen has better sound."
11401,8,i love it!
11402,8,i love it!
11403,7,love it! easy to set up and use. my family is having fun asking alexa questions and the sound quality is good enough for rockin¡¯ out while i cook <f0><u+009f><u+0091><u+00a9><u+200d><f0><u+009f><u+008d><u+00b3>
11404,1,nice sound love playing music with it
11405,10,"i love my alexa, i still have a lot to learn about how to use it. have not done the home setup yet to control lights, temperature etc. i need to read how to do that."
11406,10,"very good sound! thoroughly enjoyed the product!  easy to set up, works great, fun for the whole family.  especially like that echo  respond to anyone is voice, family and friends."
11407,14,"the fact that all music was ''removed'' [after 30 days]  then offered to charge for it after the return date...is the reason for one star ;;;  in other words;;;buyer beware,,,,,"
11408,10,"i love having alexa in my house, she helps with basic things such as turning the lights on to helping my with my chemistry hope work by quizzing me or answering questions i have"
11409,14,"absolutely amazing! i never thought i would jump on the ¡°smart home¡± trend, but i honestly do not know what i would do without alexa every single day."
11410,14,"what i like most about it,is that it is easy to use. however, i had to use my wife is phone to hook up. we had previously tried an echo dot, and never did get it synched."
11411,0,"the most responsive and knowledgeable device to talk to. i feel more like i¡¯m talking to a real person than ever, and to get good useful information to boot!"
11412,5,the party i bought this for loves it.
11413,11,"i think the sound quality is excellent!  i was considering buying bluetooth speakers, but instead bought this echo.  i am completely happy with the sound quality."
11414,10,the sound when playing music is great. i love that you can make hands free calls.
11415,0,i can not get music to play for free. i am not looking to have to pay a monthly fee for a music company or station. so as far as i am concerned this product is limited!
11416,8,great sound love it
11417,10,it is just fun to have.  learning more daily.
11418,0,most.... versatility....least...alexa seems to have a hearing problem

11428,10,"love, love, love it!  the sound is clear, alexa answers my questions and follows my commands!"
11429,10,i luv alexa!! the convience of hands free navigation of numerous voice commands is priceless!
11430,4,"easy to set up, nice looking and enjoyable to listen to."
11431,14,"wish i could find a web site or booklet that would tell me what would i need to connect three or more and or what i would need to connect to other things, lights, speakers etc."
11432,0,"i like being able to get information without looking it up. i like knowing the weather without looking it up. but the past week, all i hear is i¡¯m not sure or ido not know that."
11433,9,this is simple with a great sound and can be placed anywhere. good for those who want the quality of a great sound systemwithout the bulk. big things come in small packages.
11434,0,"easy to connect, speakers are a lot better than i expected, alexa can also hear us clearly. it is also extremely simple to set her up with any smart home equipment as well."
11435,0,it  nice  i like it  ply some  song it great
11436,12,all i can say is i love it so far.
11437,14,nice addition to the one i already had

11439,14,never knew i needed this until my son convinced me to buy it. i love this thing.
11440,0,good
11441,12,have only used it for playing music but love it!!  the sound is really great.  looking forward to finding other uses for it!!
11442,14,i like the quality of sound. had a really difficult time changing the wifi setting. had to contact tec support & they worked with me for 45 min before the problem was resolved.
11443,0,"i like the music and times she can give me for sports programs, etc.  what i did not like is that some of them she does not know and i do not know how to teach her."
11444,10,"we are enjoying alexa very much.the sound is almost as good as the bose. when listen to music we like for do not have to do it manually, just ask alexa and it is done.no ads."
11445,9,love it!
11446,14,it has a great sound and we enjoy it but  i did have some issues ¡®firing¡¯ it up.
11447,11,love it. the speaker sound is great and it hears me even when i am in the other room.
11448,1,excellent addition to my alexa apps.  sound is amazing and the clarity is untold of.
11449,3,not lonely anymore. lol as good as advertised

11452,12,love the echo! always learning new things it can do.
11453,10,"i love my echo.  sets my alarms in the morning, plays any genre of music i ask for, give me weather.  i am just beginning to find all it does.  making my life easier."
11454,4,very nice......great sound...easy to use
11455,2,love my echo
11456,0,so far its a pretty cool device. the only thing i kinda do not like is you have to download everything in order for alexa to know anything.
11457,14,defective. returned it. did not buy another. no tech support
11458,8,love it!!
11459,9,gave as a gift. they love it and play with it even
11460,10,really enjoying echo! fun information at your voice command. love the music too!
11461,14,"excellent condition no damage, and with the improved sound meet my expectations."
11462,8,love it.
11463,1,very loud and great sound quality!
11464,3,"works great, thank you."
11465,11,looks good. no issues with the sleeve or with alexa.
11466,0,instant response to requests + the variety and quality available music ¡¦. i have no list for least satisfied ¡¦..
11467,9,i am happy with my echo which i received as a gift.  sound is great.
11468,10,"i love the different stations, exploring the different genres as artists come to mind, having information available just a question away. this was a wonderful present to my self"
11469,14,"it was hard for me to get it set up to work , after that it worked good . only thing i moved yesterday and i have not been able get it to connect to our new wifi."
11470,1,"great sound in a little speaker, and the 2nd gen looks great. alexa gets smarter and smarter"
11471,10,it has been interesting& entertaining as well. bought it for my wife. use it all the time for background music & answering various topics of interest¡¯tom kager
11472,0,it is kind of fun--but we do not have a smart home and so it is hard to see why you really need this device.
11473,11,amazing sound quality easy to use plus impressive voice recognition
11474,0,"nice design but i get a lot of errors with alexa trying to answer a question.  cannot answer a question,  can not understand me, audio cuts out in middle of answer."
11475,9,everything working as expected- easier to set up since i already had an echo- less than 2-3 minutes and it was working!
11476,11,i absolutely love the echo. the sound quality and microphone sensitivity far surpassed my expectation. setup needs to be simplified.
11477,14,"great product,  did not know i could not access my youtube and google play account via this device. otherwise this is a good product!"
11478,8,"love, love, love it!"
11479,8,great product
11480,1,great sound from a small package!
11481,1,nice addition to the echo family.
11482,14,"love the system, even my wife is able to talk to it with her strong accent.not always able to link with other devises (ie arlo)"
11483,10,that i can ask it questions and play music and make lists. i dislike that it lost my grocery list within a week & i had to start over
11484,10,"i love this product. i received it as a gift and it brightens my day, makes tasks easier and i love having music playing in my house."
11485,7,yes i and my family loved it!!!it is very fun and easy!say alexa play this or ask a question etc and alexa will do it for you!loved it! use your voice commands <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0089>
11486,0,"i would probably give it more stars, however, i only use it to play music at this point.  all and all, it is a pretty cool device.  it has great potential for home automation."
11487,10,husband is 81 and loves being able to call out songs to hear without getting up to change channels! some songs not available so need to find out how to arrange getting them!!!
11488,1,amazing sound
11489,10,we use this speaker to play music in the kitchen to play music in our prime account and also serius xm account. it sounds great. great speaker at a great price.
11490,14,this new echo is fantastic! we have it centrally located in our home and it sounds like a complete surround sound system!!
11491,14,echo arrived with no power cord. was disappointed because i was excited about setting it up until the instructions said to attach power cord. how do i get one?
11492,14,"was very easy to pair with internet, music and dish tv."
11493,14,the setup was not the easiest-programming for music listening did not seem intuitive.  no instructions given how to set up to achieve it is potential
11494,10,why do you ask?  i did not buy it here.  it was a christmas gift.  but i do have fun with alexa!  she never ceases to amaze me.  thanks for asking.
11495,4,great sound and very user friendly.
11496,0,i really do not like the echo. it is not knowledgeable. it can never hear you and it always tells you to repeat what you say cause it does not understand you
11497,4,very helpful and enjoyable.
11498,10,good buy. get lots of info and music. easy to use and set up
11499,0,everything and have not found anything to like the least
11500,10,love the way you can get news and weather or set an alarm
11501,14,"very satisfied with all that i have received from amazon, from service help to the delivery.. the sound and clarity is amazing and yes i have everyone looking into amazon products.. thank you <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+008a>"
11502,14,we have no idea what the heck to do with this???
11503,8,this thing is amazing!  we love it!!!
11504,11,i love the sound quality and ease of use of the echo (2nd generation).  i also like the new gray color...very stylish!
11505,0,"it is ok at best. when i ask it to play a song, it usual says it can not find it or needs to add it to aa ""station"". if you do not have a smart home, it uses are limited."
11506,1,"the echo is perfect and with ""alexa"" it was great!"
11507,14,"we really like the 4 that we bought however, the intercom function only works on 3 of them.  when we try to drop in to one of our bedrooms, it always goes to another one."
11508,12,"works like a charm, love the skills it has to offer and more to come"
11509,3,it works great! just as advertised.
11510,0,"convenience, do not like having to plug it in,"
11511,14,"forget what a headache ai tec is, but having a continuous light revolving around every room is completely off the charts"
11512,9,nice addition to my home. the whole family loves it.
11513,10,recd this as a christmas gift!  love the variety of information alexa provides!
11514,10,love my alexa.. the sound is perfect.
11515,3,love it i know it can more too
11516,14,"first of all, sound is amazing. sleek designs blends in and the convince to just  be able to play music while cooking and not having to wash your hand is fantastic."
11517,3,alexa works well.
11518,11,does not seem to be as responsive as the echo dot but that could be because of the size. the sound is amazing
11519,14,"this was a gift from someone. i am less than thrilled to have a listening device in my house, but thought it might be useful to play podcasts without logging into the computer. it does not access any quality podcasts. even after subscribing to the music program, because it will not play the music i own, as that music did not come from amazon, the music is offers is vert limited, when it comes to classical music. only one song by william byrd. only one song by palestina. the ""classical"" channel thinks whiny amazing grace is a classical song. worst of all, it can barely understand me. it needs some kind of setting to prevent it from translating my pretty basic continental american accent into vulgarities. when looking for classical music, it some how heard f!ck when i asked for a fugue, wet dreams when i asked for a requiem, and vagina when i asked for a salve regina. i am finding it very insulting, biased against having any information on catholic culture or history, and am very disappointed in its capabilities, especially its inability to find almost any podcast that is not presented by a multi-national bestseller."
11520,14,"not many features. good sound quality.a few bugs, alexa gets stuck and becomes not responsive. hopefully alexa gets nice upgrades as time goes."
11521,0,i am not happy with the fact i programmed it to respond to my voice and my voice only so i thought its resounding too any and everyone is voice i am disappointed..
11522,0,"sometimes you have to repeat yourself,but other than that,i like it"
11523,1,this is an amazing product! i love how knowledgeable and fun it is.
11524,10,love alexa!
11525,14,works very well. it started having some hiccups after a few months then kind of cleared itself up. probably some bugs with updates. overall would recommend to friends
11526,9,i love all my echo is.  we have them in our house(2). in our daughters house(2) in the back and in each of my daughter and son n laws classrooms. (kindergarten and high school).
11527,14,does not work rite.  will not play my prime music.  emailed tech support.  no help at all!!!!  am thinking of sending it back to amazon and getting my money back.
11528,3,"works great, have no problems"
11529,14,i cant get hooked up
11530,10,we enjoy the echo a lot. we have fun with it and as time goes on we hope to bring more devices in our house online with it.
11531,12,ease of use. nothing found yet i do not like
11532,9,wonderful sound from such a small footprint. i find myself listening to music more often because i can just ask alexa!! i would highly recommend.
11533,9,the echo was my christmas gift from my husband. i love it. still finding new things for alexa to do. friends have shared ideas too.
11534,14,love it and use it on a daily basis. the frustrating part is there is not a way to simply connect to it and make it just a bluetooth speaker.
11535,10,i love everything about it. my mom bought me this for xmas. love i can ask for the weather update & my favorite music every morning.
11536,10,what a fun and great device!!! we turn off the tv and listen to music.  the sound quality is awesome! very easy to set up.
11537,10,i love my echo...fun asking questions and playing music...still learning other things to do
11538,0,"love  it, pretty handy are some things that can answer but knows a lot"
11539,10,i love ithaving so much fun. turning lights on in another rooms is the best!  there is alot to learn about this whole setup so therefore i am sure i will like it even more.
11540,14,am a beginner with echo so am still learning skills with help from my son.  unable to provide a review at this time but i do love being able to turn off lights with my voice!
11541,0,i live in a rural area and she cant find sone of the local radio stations. otherwise the sound is great. also i wish it was linked to my podcasts.
11542,14,was not sure i was going to like it but alexa has been very helpful. could be a little easier to set up.
11543,9,"it is super good, i have both the new gen and the old gen and i love them both so much. the quality of the speaker is amazing and alexa always has the best answers."
11544,1,wonderful i love the echo and alexa.
11545,10,first time user and i love love love!!!!!
11546,9,works so great love gen one love love gen two!
11547,11,"love the sound, overall i love the speaker and i would recommend echo to everyone."
11548,0,do not like that you have to pay for services such as music
11549,11,speaker is not same quality as original alexa.volume needs more granularity. seeting volume at 2 is too low for night background music and 3 is too loud.
11550,12,so fun and useful!
11551,3,everything and mor than you could expect
11552,1,"the echo is amazing, we are enjoying all the information and fun we are having"
11553,14,on occasions the echo does not follow voice commands have to unplug the device.
11554,0,still trying to figure out how to activate all of its function. it seems we need to be very careful how we word our requests for alexa to understand what we want.
11555,13,alexa te amo..
11556,1,this is a fantastic resource!
11557,12,awesome all i can say.
11558,11,"love this i also have the dot , sound is so much better"
11559,10,this product is so nice to have in the kitchen! from recipe measurements to listening to music in the background hands free while cooking. i want one for every room!!!
11560,0,not really worth it. does not understand most commands or questions
11561,0,we like it but do not use it often. i wish music was easier
11562,14,"awesome product. love alexa. easy to set up, some difficulty pairing other devices to it, like wemo plugs and such, but figured it out eventually. good sound quality"
11563,10,i like the news sports music. great for a sleep timer and cooking timer. have nothing negative to say so far
11564,9,we were not sure dad would use echo.  he loves the music.  the sound is amazing.
11565,9,worth every bit of money. order 2. 2 for downstairs and 2 for upstairs. will be ordering the smaller echos for other bedrooms.
11566,11,it is billed as having better speaker quality than 1st gen echo.  i disagree<u+2014>prefer 1st gen sound.  my main issue is the performance of the tunein app.
11567,0,"love the music.  speaker is great.  when alexa is talking, i have a hard time understanding her.  i ask for a joke and do not understand a word of it."
11568,0,"love everything about it!  even when she does not understand the question and gives a different answer anyway,  good for a laugh!!"
11569,10,enjoying the opportunity to play so much music by so many different artists. a neat toy to have when you have everything..........
11570,0,"most of the questions you ask it, it does not know. this is a device to get people to buy their ""prime"" membership. without it there is little this can thing can do."
11571,4,it is easy to operate and makes information quick and easy.  works as good if not better than siri on my iphone.
11572,11,what liked most was the sound . do not get me wrong it is not a premium audio speaker. sounds 100% better than the dot
11573,10,this is a must have for everybody. it is capable of doing almost anything. i love ordering from amazon simply telling alexa what to add to my cart.
11574,14,we love our echo! especially combined with amazon prime music unlimited!
11575,9,awesome!! wife and kids love it
11576,4,"pleased, fun and easy to use..."
11577,0,sometimes she does not listen to me and i have to reboot her and start over.  i am still on a learning curve so that could be part of the problem.
11578,0,was not what i was expecting starts playing then just stops it has done it so many times that i just do not use it anymore
11579,1,awesome
11580,0,i¡¯m satisfied with my alexa although sometimes she has a little difficult of hearing.
11581,9,the product is a big hit at our home!
11582,12,early days but enjoying it so far. it seems to be slowly learning my accent as i learn what wording to use.
11583,0,i like that i can ask alexa for the weather and she also plays just about any song i ask for. but she does not know half of what siri knows and usually answers ¡°i do not know¡±
11584,10,i keep forgetting the things i can ask alexa. i need to make a card and laminate it. this way i can keep it next to the device so i have my questions right at my fingertips.
11585,0,"it was exactly what i expected. sometimes she responds when i have not said her name but other than that, it is great!"
11586,4,just as expected. east set up and operation. sounds like a big stereo system.
11587,14,"exactly as advertised, packs a punch for such a small electronic. i will probably order another one, or maybe two...haha"
11588,10,my echo has become a good friend!
11589,10,enjoy the music the most.
11590,1,amazing! very fast response.
11591,12,"so far we are enjoying it, just set it up so are still getting use to all the features"
11592,12,love it so far!
11593,10,adds convenience and fun
11594,14,"love gen 2, the sound is great as well as the look, i got the grey and it looks fantastic. very happy with it and take everywhere i go that i know i will have wi-fi"
11595,0,we received this as a christmas gift. we love it but it only gets 3 stars because we have to repeat ourselves multiple times to get a correct action from this echo.
11596,5,great gift...they love it!
11597,8,awsome
11598,8,love it!!
11599,1,"i like this product a lot, it is fun to use and the sound is excellent"
11600,5,got this as a gift. everyone here loves it!
11601,11,i like everything about this model of echo.
11602,12,so much fun to use!
11603,12,i am loving my echo. still learning all the ways it can help and entertain me!
11604,14,"the best part about it is handy for information, timers, and weather info. the least liked thing about it is that it does not respond as well as the echo dot."
11605,9,"i love my echo. music,  weather...anything i need to know, i just ask. best purchase i have made for myself in a long time."
11606,10,"i like the quick responsiveness of the echo.  i like the fact that the echo plays music on demand, compliments me and answers questions"
11607,5,"gift, they liked it."
11608,1,everyone needs this!
11609,0,quite human-like!
11610,14,ease of operation.goes off by itself at times ..scary
11611,1,outstanding sound quality and easy setup!
11612,14,"i purchased the 2nd generation echo from home depot and my reviews are mixed. i enjoy the device as a whole as it makes basic functions such as looking up the weather or the news simple with the sound of my voice. however, i have issues with alexa deciphering some of the skills that i have enabled, sometimes playing previous music, audiobooks, or other skills. this can go on indefinitely until i stop trying all together and finally, after awhile, she will heed my new request and play what i asked. i use this device as a sound machine and so far, doing so is a hit or a miss. my brother is generation 1 echo does not seem to suffer from these issues and i even insured that the skills i have enabled are limited to prevent confusion with the audio but still, same problem. if i have to hear my music blast one more time after asking her to play ""waterfall sounds"" by voice apps llc, i am considering sending this device back, as well as the one i purchased for my parents as their christmas present. if anyone has any insight as googling this query only comes up with very basic problems, please help, thanks!"
11613,14,i am very pleased but the device keeps crashing and i have to reinstall the wifi often also she has a hard time understanding other than that i love the device
11614,10,i love this thing... i do not have prime but it is still a neat little assistant... recognizes me by voice and the kids love the skills she can learn.
11615,1,i am very satisfied with my echo and enjoying great music selections from amazon prime. i am also having a lot of fun with alexa.
11616,0,not impressed with the unit. alexa can not answer basic questions except the weather and some common questions. not worth the money.
11617,9,"i use my echo for music, my smart home and other apps. love it !"
11618,11,"did not care what color i got, but this was on sale.  the color goes with anything"
11619,14,"sound quality good but ""skills"" are buggy and its hard to use on a daily basis if you are never sure what will work and what will fail."
11620,11,it works as advertised but nothing new to note. i have the dot also and its pretty much the same but cheaper
11621,10,i love alexa!! it makes little chores around the house easier. still learning new things.
11622,14,feel like i am in a jetsons episode.  our home has gotten very smart since alexa arrived!
11623,10,i absolutely love my echo. it is so sleek and blends in well with my home you do not even notice it. from the music down to the jeopardy like question i ask alexa never fails me.
11624,1,"we are having so much fun with this.  sometimes we even argue, and alexa returns the jests. love playing our music, and use it for our television sound.  the sound is great"
11625,10,i love waking up everyday and saying good morning to alexa. she usually makes  me smile with the response. my least favorite is she has problems calling some of my contacts
11626,14,i love it and kids use it all the time. my only request is for it to make star wars battle sounds lazier blast and ship sounds  light saber sounds
11627,1,excellent product with fantastic sound. you can play games and play music! it is a pretty neat little speaker tool!
11628,10,i use mine mostly for playing music but i really love it!
11629,10,very impressed. does a lot more than i thought it did. have a lot of fun playing kid games with my grandkids.
11630,9,"echo is great, so many uses, use it everyday."
11631,0,i like the audio when playing music. i find the search capabilities to be less effective than i expected. i often have to rephrase my questions to get info i seek
11632,10,i love it..we have a lot of fun with her..she is witty..when im home alone..i dont feel alone..lol
11633,2,i really love this new echo!!!!
11634,4,great sound quick delivery
11635,14,"the audio quality is definitely a downgrade from the original echo.  i ordered the newest version, only because of how much i liked the original echo, and echo dot that i already own. i noticed the degradation in sound quality immediately.  just to be sure it was not just me, i did a side-by-side comparison with all-device multi room turned on. it was not even close, my wife noticed the difference in quality also, from the moment i turned it on.  this was after thanksgiving, even with the newest software updates applied.  unfortunately, i knew i had to return it immediately. now, i am not sure if i should try to get another first generation echo, or maybe hold off for them to fix the issues with newer models.  it really bummed me out."
11636,9,awesome
11637,0,"i like that i can ask alexa questions. i do not like how difficult it is to add multiple accounts so both my husband and i can enjoy it. other than that, it is cool!"
11638,11,really like it but the sound is not 100% what we had expected. still really like it!!
11639,10,ease of set up  all of the information that you can obtain and playing music via spotify is so easy

11643,1,love the echo. sound quality is fantastic.
11644,10,information at the sound of my voice - very convenient.  i like that you can request notifications for times throughout the day.

11649,1,very entertaining  and informative
11650,2,love our echo.

11653,13,best gift yet.

11657,10,"very fun and helpful.  it adds, subtracts, multiplies and answers all our questions.  we learn a word of the day and play a game of deal or no deal."
11658,0,i love my echo. i ask her many questions. i love the most you can request any song and it plays it instantly. i dislike the most is it has to stay plugged in at all times.
11659,10,"still learning everything alexa can do, but like it for quick music and /or answers and weather!"
11660,9,i got the echo for my boyfriend for christmas. he is blind. he loves it! he says it is the best gift you can give a blind person.

11666,0,"i can not get any music,i ask questions get no answer. i can on get my alarm to work.i ask to wake me @ 5am thats is the only thing that works"
11667,2,love love love alexa!
11668,14,"it is an ok echo.  they have all been ok and can still use some improvement.  i am sure over time, they will get better."
11669,1,this is a truly awesome product. from the first feel till the first sound it is a quality product.
11670,3,alexa is not as bright as i would hoped for.
11671,9,this was actually a xmas gift for my son and he loves it.  has many uses.  the second was for my niece is wedding gift.  this was the gift the groom was most excited about.

11674,11,the sound is so much better than the first gen echo
11675,1,excellent asistent to work daily! i love this product!
11676,14,i am paying extra of 3.99/pm for musicwhen i ask to play a concerto it usually only plays the first movement
11677,12,its great for music but i find i really do not use the rest of its features.
11678,7,<f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0081><f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0081><f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0081><f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0081><f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0081><f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0081>
11679,12,fun... still  learning about it
11680,10,great for nice music and informational issues. use mostly in kitchen while cooking.
11681,4,"excellent quality, sound and user friendly! love it!"
11682,0,volume is cool. unfortunately there is a lot she does not know the answers. tune it up and the stars go up.
11683,0,great sound but sometimes plays different music than requested.
11684,8,love it
11685,8,this is an excellent product. we love it.
11686,10,"love the music! love to play jeopardy! get the weather and news! want to hook to lights, but still reading up on how to do it!"
11687,1,pleased with purchase
11688,0,i love everything about it.  i have not been able to use it much because i¡¯ve been away often on. it is fast accurate and like having a friend it home with you
11689,14,a modern miracle
11690,11,"i am really enjoying my 2nd generation echo, it looks great and performs well."
11691,1,awesome product!  setup was a breeze.  i use it everyday.  it is both informative and quite entertaining.
11692,14,for a few days it played new age music then one day it could not.  does it even play music as on an i pod?
11693,14,this little thing replaced a lot of old equipment; and the big cabinet those boxes were in.
11694,14,"still has issues understanding and seems to take the first thing it finds or ""programmed to find"".  for the most part, it does what i bought it to do."
11695,14,it is not able to get me routes or the weather. sometimes while playing music from my spotify library just stops suddenly.
11696,5,i think my husband loves alexa more than me! :-)he is a very non gaget guy and loves this gift!
11697,9,i am a stay at home mom and my 3 year old son just loves it! it makes the days go by faster with music we can dance and sing to during the day! :) we love alexa <u+2764><u+fe0f>
11698,10,the ease by which you could request music and radio stations and fun with grandchildren tell a joke made it an awesome gift forchristmas.
11699,1,very good sound for such a small package. very responsive. no real complaints. fine product at a reasonable price.
11700,1,"it has an amazing sound quality and it is very entertaining, not to mention the awesome look. greatly recommended."

11702,0,"spotify integration could be,improvedstupid a song can not be replayeddumb there is no line outbiggest stupid item: you can not hook up a second speakervery disapointed"
11703,14,great sound recognition and quality of speaker.  there are many options that i have not selected due to cyber security concerns.  love amazon music option!
11704,11,i love it so much. it does a whole lot. the speaker is louder than i thought. it can literally hear you from across the room.
11705,14,"this does what it is supposed to, but alexa does a so-so job of understanding what is being asked, and the speaker sounds a little ""tinny"" when you turn it up louder."
11706,11,better speaker capability needed
11707,3,love it more than i expected
11708,1,"the sound quality is wonderful, very pleased."
11709,10,i like how easy it is to setup and use. i really like the voice for alexa. i like how much information is available and how alexa can tell jokes and other fun things
11710,0,"i like using this, however, i wish it charged and was portable.  it has to be plugged in at all times to work."
11711,0,"nice sounds. i hear ""i do not know how to do that"" too often"
11712,9,very impressed with the sound of the music. have not used it much cuz it is a christmas gift for my wife. shhhh. she is gonna love it.
11713,14,did you guys use any women in your testing? why can not this f****** thing hear me? i have had multiple women try out this product and female voices do not register.
11714,10,i have more fun with this echo.  the real fun is adding more apps.
11715,11,definitely made a difference compared to the previous ones i purchased
11716,14,very easy to address as long as you use the correct words. very convenient to link up with amazon music and my iphone.
11717,10,i love the art lessons and pandora  music. jokes are cute also. do more info lessons like art lessons about history facts.  wish i could fine tune volume a little better
11718,8,works great!
11719,8,it is awesome
11720,1,the sound quality is awesome i love listening to music on the echo

11726,9,the echo two was a christmas gift . love it
11727,10,we love it.  my grandson loves to ask it to tell jokes and play music.  husband loves the music. it is really funny when it responds to something said on tv.
11728,14,sound quality is excellent and perfect for my studio apartment. 4 stars because it randomly stops playing spotify/audible and have to re start to reconnect.
11729,5,my wife is enjoying it.
11730,14,"great sound quality. i am having trouble linking this device to my dot, not sure if this is user error or if the two just will not link. other than that we use it everyday."
11731,14,i am amazed on the things that  echo can do. i originally just gave it one star but now re rate it with five stars. i love it it also plays music of your favorite songs.
11732,10,i love my echo! it truly does make my life easier. it keeps me informed as well as entertained. i am excited to learn more about my echo and see what all it has to offer!
11733,14,"awesome device, best thing since sliced bread.  i finally have someone intelligent to talk to.  i spend a significant amount of time alone.  alexa is a great companion."
11734,9,i still have not stumped it with a question and i love the music. it was a christmas gift from my daughter so i will definetely keep her in my will

11742,10,"we are enjoying our echo so much!  we ask alexia to play a lot of music, wonderful sound!"
11743,14,the convenience and the sound. that i can not  put in my own mix of artist and .music
11744,10,i enjoy the hands free communication but will be able to utilize more as i learn the right way to ask her questions.  love her secretarial skills to help with lists etc...
11745,14,npr and audiobooks never sounded better!
11746,9,i received this as a christmas gift. i love it and my 7 year old does too!! it is great because i do not have to look everything up on my phone and i can listen to music!!
11747,10,absolutely love my alexa echo!she wakes me up in the morning and plays the music i love. truly do not know how we ever lived without her. my new right arm. love her

11750,1,extremely happy with this product.  has a very nice sound.  please with the alexa commands and responses.  would highly recommend.
11751,0,"alexa has difficulty understanding what someone is asking, too often"
11752,0,"everything i ask alexa is reaponded with ""sorry i do not know that one."" alexa, what do you know?"
11753,11,this is our 4th echo.  much better sound quality and louder than the first generation.

11756,8,love it
11757,12,loving it !!
11758,14,it is hard to set up with skill sets and not being able to reset it is a pain
11759,10,we are addicted to alexa! price was fantastic!
11760,14,for some reason the power plug or the smart plug that came with it for 5 extra dollars is not working. and we have tried following the directions and it is getting frustrating
11761,14,amazing! the ¡®everywhere¡¯ i.e the prompt to have her play everywhere that there is a recognized alexa base. it is phenomenal! gone are the days of sound bars! go amazon go!
11762,1,i absolutely love the sound!  alexa is fun. i love it!

11765,9,received as a gift and absolutely love it!!!!  even the five year old can use it.
11766,14,"first day, it just gave an alrming sound. bip bip bip continously doesnt stop. then i minimize the volume for it to stop. then the sound was totally gone."
11767,10,"love my echo.  i use it to play music mostly, but it has too many other uses to list.  my kids and i all have one."
11768,10,i was able to hear songs that you do not hear on the radio. so much to hear and learn from the echo. had it since xmas.and still learning how to use it. love it.
11769,14,it needs to know more facts. it would also be better if you could just say play nikki manaj and it plays one of here songs instead of haveing to pair it with a song website
11770,1,great device. fast access to music.
11771,9,echo is all i expected and more.  i got it for my wife and she now has someone other than me to argue with!  i love it (and i think she does also).
11772,10,"easy to set up, sounds fantastic. alexa knows every song i have asked her to play,  and plays great games."
11773,14,"yes, it has been a true treat to have ""her"" available for us to use.."
11774,9,love my echo so much i bought the dot too.

11780,12,"awesome, we discover a new feature every day. itseems"
11781,1,great shipping great item we are very pleased with it
11782,10,easy to keep clean and it blends with every thing in any room.
11783,9,a really fun piece of electronics. enjoy it more each day. never even heard of it until the kids got one for me at christmas.
11784,14,sound is not that much improved. sometimes will not shut off when asked (color ring remains on). it is still worth the price.
11785,9,"my friend got one and she asked me to set it up for her, which was easy. we played around with it. when i got i ordered one. love it."
11786,4,"good sound, easy to use. had difficulty with initial set up.still learning set ups"
11787,0,still getting use to it and really have no opinion as yet. sorry!
11788,0,"rarely can answer my questions which are fairly basic, nor can find right music, have to repeat all the time until so frustrated i give up."
11789,11,the sound quality is nowhere as good as i was led to believe it would be.
11790,14,didnt work in brazil
11791,9,works wonderful i mostly use it to play music completely seamless with amazon music love it.
11792,14,i like the echo. my big is complaint is that it has the stay plugged in and i can not disconnected and move it to another room without carrying a power cable
11793,10,easy to set up and i love the music i can play...almost no limit. it is like having my own personal assistant!
11794,0,we have found that this device is not always responsive to commands. many times we direct it to open something we request and we get no response.
11795,14,"does not stay connected to wifi. have to be reset once in a while. does not support aux in, which i personally need.decend sound and great voice response though."
11796,10,so easy to use! love that i can tell it to play different types of music and it does so immediately.
11797,3,"we love it, it works really well. i would highly recommend it"
11798,0,it is ok but somethings i ask google alexa can not answer...the sound is incredible for it size!....for the most part it is good to have.
11799,13,beautifulto have
11800,10,"i am enjoying my echo so far without any problems and hopefully there won""t  be any. i would highly recommend it to friend."
11801,9,<u+2764><u+fe0f> my alexa!! can not wait to buy more for other rooms. best enterment is watching my 6 year old grandson learning to use it.
11802,11,the echo 2nd generation works great.  it was easy to set up and we have enjoyed it  very much. we are amazed at voice recognition and pleased with the quality of the sound.
11803,14,i received the item and it does not work i have been trying to troubleshoot it but it will not connect. now i am trying to return it.
11804,1,really useful household tool
11805,10,there is so much you can do with echo.  i learn something new every day.  can not wait until you can customize the voice and activation word.  definitely worth the price.
11806,0,great music sounds and great entertainment.  dislike is prime membership leaves out a lot of music. i asked alexa to play several sounds that she says she does not have.
11807,0,it is nice to have access to music promptly and in places anywhere.  the music for new age is often the same though.  sometime alexa does not seem to hear.
11808,1,setup was easy. it has a very sensitive response. gets music quickly. a very useful piece of equipment.
11809,12,"interesting, but a lot it cannot do.good tool for amazon to sell more services."
11810,8,we love it use it everyday
11811,14,i like it over the dot i have.
11812,14,the echo installed instantly to my wifi and my multi room music group. it sounds great and is an extra convenience to my smart home devices.
11813,9,"bought one for my sons birthday, the grandkids are having a blast with it."
11814,1,very good
11815,1,"very good sound, for this value."
11816,10,"works great, we use it mostly for music. it has nice speakers and the whole family has fun requesting songs to play."
11817,1,love it. in joyed its sound.
11818,14,"with both 2nd gen echos i purchased, i had to go through setup 2-3 times to get the device operational. once operational,1. drop-in did not work on either device (ring ring ring, no connection)2. could not control volume of device from spotify (did not have this issue with first gen echo)3. bluetooth name of echo stays as initial name (e.g. echo-oul) not the new name i give it, which is confusing when you have multiple4. multi-room music does not work; as soon as i select one of my echos, the other one grays out as ""unavailable""5. no longer connects to phillips hue (can not even find the devices in software menu)6. each individual echo had to be reset with my address7. my regular iphone sound (for things like instagram videos, etc) no longer works when connected to echo via bluetooth. i have to turn bluetooth off completely to get phone audio.really disappointing. i did not have any of these issues with first gen echo. i do not think this product was ready for launch. i would suggest avoiding purchase until amazon works out the issues."
11819,1,great sound amazing capabilities and fun!
11820,11,great upgrade from the amazon echo dot. love the crisp clear sound and clean look. it is also cool new feature being able change the cover.
11821,3,"great sound quality, very useful. i bought it for fun and have found it is more than i would hoped for."
11822,10,perfect!!
11823,14,"i now own four echos.  i was thrilled to read that multi-room music would be supported.apparently, there is no support for multi-room music if you have spotify.  they do not tell you that when promoting this feature on their web page.  amazon craftily say it is supported by ""some third-party music providers.""  considering spotify is their #1 third-party music provider, you would think they would at least tell us spotify users, ""sorry, not yet.""  nope.  gotta sell those echos.  chalk me up for one of perhaps thousands that was duped into this.  for now, i will keep the echos, in hopes that spotify and amazon come to an agreement.  i will not yield to ""the tyranny of the 'or'"" (""you can have multi room music with the echo using amazon music unlimited or you can have spotify"").  i will not switch to amazon music unlimited, at least not until spotify goes out of business.  this is simply a fair consumer choice prerogative, and somebody is not supporting it (due to ndas, i have no idea if the problem is with amazon or spotify, so i am neither canceling my spotify subscription nor returning the echos, yet).  my review will remain one star, however, because this current situation has made my four echo is pretty disconnected from each other - pretty much the opposite of how the echos are promoted).if this issue is resolved, i will change my rating.  until then, i am a very unhappy echo owner.  i feel like i have been duped."
11824,9,i love alexa! she assists me with many things throughout the day.  i am considering buying both of my children an echo dot as well!
11825,14,this thing is great.  i can not believe the sound that comes out of this thing
11826,1,it is a great product.
11827,14,she is not that smart!!
11828,2,my new best friend! love it
11829,10,great sound! fun to use! it keeps me company when i do not have anyone to talk to!
11830,1,"love it sound quality is awesome, crisp and clear."
11831,5,was a gift and my mom loves it
11832,10,she brings us radio in our livingroom and answers our questions with no complaints. we have not asked to call anyone yet
11833,10,it is informative and fun! i play music while fixing dinner and she answers any questions.
11834,14,easy to link with one wi-fi....amazing sound...makes conventional stereo systems obsolete
11835,0,nice sound but ineffective response and user abilities limited compared to googles.
11836,0,"good speakers, but alexa does not seem to be able to do many of the functions that are advertised."
11837,0,"music sounds good, but she does not know the answers to a lot of the questions i ask...almost makes me wish i went with the google version"
11838,12,"i¡¯m very pleased with my echo.  it does so much and i have not even begun to see how much it actually does.  sound is great and love reminders, music, etc."
11839,10,it is great i can have so much fun listening to the music i want to hear
11840,1,easy to use works well with stereo and sounds pretty good as a bluetooth speaker. has a pretty good base
11841,3,it is everything i expected.  works great from the start
11842,0,alexa does not always reply and sometimes just stops playing music.
11843,0,it looks nice and will tell you about the weather but that is about it. ask it to play music...forget it! rarely able to answer simple questions.
11844,0,"this device only works sporadically.  most of the time, alexa says she is having trouble understanding me, to try again later."
11845,0,so cool!!! i love it. only thing that it recognizes when the tv has commercials about it! but it is very rare!!! otherwise the best thing ever!
11846,14,"as usual, amazon is simply amazing and the best! the most easy purchase the most easy search the most easy prices, amazon is just easy and i love them!"
11847,9,everyone has enjoyed using the echo!
11848,0,it is awesome! but the getting signed in and trying to figure out what you can do and can not do can be confusing.
11849,3,works as expected.
11850,14,"it keeps my company on tough days , needs to be more personal  call me by name when i chat with her. good sound when playing music"
11851,14,"maybe it is my problem, but there is a creepy element to it.  she woke up this morning when my wife said something that to my ears sounded nothing like, ""alexa""."
11852,9,i bought it for my stepdad and it is very easy to use. the setup is simple. the speaker is great and alexa just does not disappoint. will be buying one for myself soon.
11853,10,"i love everything. mostly when i awake in the morning in the dark, alexa tells me the time and weather. she is my best friend lol"
11854,14,the speaker upgrade is well worth the cost. really enjoy listening to music unlimited.
11855,0,"so far, i like everything about it. was a little confusing setting up a designation for each one, but i figured it out.  sound quality is fantastic.  ed"
11856,9,tied it to my nest and it works like a charm. very entertaining by all in the family
11857,10,i like the skills available and the responsiveness of alexa. my family loves it
11858,9,awesome!  should have ordered one a long time ago!  i have ordered a second one.  this would also make a great gift!!
11859,1,great and fun
11860,0,"i like the product. nice features and up to date info, like weather and sports. still needs work. at times comes on for no apparent reason."
11861,14,"great product, happy with it. would be nice to have something like this to use on the road with a car charger."
11862,1,good sound quality
11863,1,good
11864,9,love. family hit.
11865,10,i love talking to my alexa. she is so funny.
11866,11,the sound quality is good.
11867,1,excellent sound quality
11868,9,"68 years old and lovin the tech,i¡¯m gonna fill my house with these,learning more everyday"
11869,3,uhhh i did not order this.....
11870,0,"i like that i can listen to a variety of music, at the volume i prefer at the time.  i still need to utilize many of the other skills, but i am working on it."
11871,11,the sound fills the room! the voice recognition is 100 and the new design options fit our decor. i love it!
11872,2,love itz
11873,14,it is easy to use and is enjoyableespecially when tv has an abundance of lousy shows. it has lovely music for elderly people
11874,1,lots of fun.
11875,14,music playing and choice is very good.  i do not use it for much else though which is why i did not rate it higher.
11876,10,i enjoy asking alexa questions and playing question of the day.sometimes alexa starts talking without any prompts.
11877,0,"always knows the weather.disappointed that most questions are answered with, ¡°i am still learning about this subject¡± or ¡°i¡¯m not sure¡± or ¡°i have no opinion.¡±"
11878,9,i love echo! alexa and echo know everything!!
11879,14,hard to enable phone verification when not in the usa.
11880,9,this has made many things in life easier...it has also brought music back into my home!!!  so worth every penny!!!
11881,9,my husband surprised me and had three echos installed and ready through-out the house -i love it - now i have alexa there to help or play my favorite tunes through the whole house.
11882,5,it was a gift for my son and his wife. they love it!
11883,1,great product
11884,14,"we have had ours for about a month. rugged design, easy to use. love it!! great help desk support from amazon if you need it."
11885,7,i love my alexa echo. i am able to do everything from learn the weather for today to practice a foreign language!! easy to use<f0><u+009f><u+008e><u+0089><f0><u+009f><u+008e><u+0089><f0><u+009f><u+008e><u+0089>
11886,10,"fun toy, great speaker quality.  mainly used to play music."
11887,10,"still discovering what it can and can not do.  setting timer in kitchen, reminders, grocery lists, playing my audiobooks, favorites so far."
11888,0,"keeps me company but alexa  is limited in her knowledge in many areas and keeps saying i do not know, wish it were a taking encyclopedia!!"
11889,3,it worked as expected
11890,9,love it made for younger and older....our home ranges from 6 years to 60 years and something for everyone and we are learning from each other.  very seldom stumped...
11891,10,really great sound quality and the music capabilities are amazing. it is helping me get my 7 year old to enjoy classical music!
11892,11,amazon echo and alexa sound better coming from the 2nd generation echo.
11893,10,"i love getting up to date news , my flash briefings every morning.  the sound is amazing ."
11894,3,just as expected.
11895,0,for the most part i like it but i have a problem once in awhile when i tell it to stop it does not do it. i have to stop it by using my android.
11896,14,its like a fancy alarm clock that plays music but only through a subscription. once i get rid of spotify i doubt ill have a use for it anymore.
11897,14,it is absolutely awesome!!!not a single shortcoming in my mind!use it to wake up and puts me to sleep
11898,8,love it
11899,0,love the sound and all that alexa can do but did not realize you had to pay for amazon to access most that alexa can do.
11900,0,i wanted it for the music but it is limited unless you pay more. also alexa gets it wrong often or says ¡°i does not know that¡±  not what it is cracked up to be
11901,10,listening to music and streaming npr. kind of leery about alexa spying on me.......
11902,12,the echo is awesome.  we enjoy using it all the time.  thank you so much.
11903,4,easy to set up.
11904,10,"music,shopping list, weather report, and questions answered"
11905,12,"love it!  still learning what she can do, but she is aweome!"
11906,9,shipped fast. works great. sound is very good for the money. wished i would have bought another.
11907,10,nice to have around
11908,0,we are having fun with alexa (sometimes called alexis or aleisha or alex--we have memory lapses).  we enjoy the music from amazon prime.
11909,12,love this echo!  it is so much fun
11910,9,i recieved this as a christmas gift i love it. the sound is amazing. alexa makes smile when i need too. i suggest everyone must have one in there home...
11911,12,i really enjoy the sound quality of the music most of all. i also love all the things it can do for you. still finding a lot of new features every day. fantastic
11912,0,"does not seem to have a good search engine, as it comes back with ""i do not know"" all the time, when if i entwr same thing into google it has an answer?"
11913,0,i like the music but she dose not know much of anything i thought she can get information being she is online ?
11914,5,sent as a christmas gift
11915,8,it is awesome
11916,14,it has very good sound. only downfall is it is not rechargeable. other than that my family and i love it!!
11917,10,"great fun, lots of useful information, really like the ""morning flash report"", super music choices.... use it all day!"
11918,11,poor sound quality.  not an upgrade
11919,4,no problem very easy setup sounds great
11920,12,"fun device!  lots of options.  i have not had time to explore everything, but i¡¯m very pleased"
11921,14,the dolby sound is incredible.  so clear and sharp.  nothing yet that i am not happy with - do not think i will find anything !  completely 100% satisfied.
11922,11,"it was given to me as a gift. i enjoy the music and i like the size and finish, it matches my furniture. i have not found anything i do not like about it yet."
11923,0,"i like the sleek look of it; it just is not as exciting as i thoug it was going to be ; and her answer to "" everything"" is i do not know ipad is better"
11924,0,i like it all
11925,14,overall very good!! sound varies and has to be adjusted up and down!!!
11926,0,pause out too much
11927,12,fun to have. really does a lot. great purchase
11928,10,lots of fun asking questions
11929,7,it has very good sound and love how you can be across the room and tell it what to do and it respondsdo not like how you need to have it plugged in all the time <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0095>
11930,3,"received on time, as expected"
11931,8,love it.
11932,11,i really like the sound produced and the microphone picks up great. it would be nice to bluetooth a aftermarket speaker and play the echo at the same time
11933,14,needs to have 24 hr format.
11934,9,this is my second order and i love it
11935,10,"we love it all. so nice to ask the weather, play music, ask questions, play games, etc.lots of great info.really enjoy it."
11936,11,"i wish the speaker quality were a little better and that the app had an equaliser for music.  other than that, i have no complaints."
11937,14,"works as it says without any problems, i put a 2 smart plugs in and alexa does the rest, easy setup shipping next day."
11938,1,excellent sound
11939,14,"after a few days, alexa is volume stopped working. she is regrettably useless and i am very disappointed in amazon right now. bottom line: i expected better."
11940,0,i really like how convenient and efficient it is.  i do not like that if something goes wrong you have to start from the very beginning and set it back up.
11941,1,absolutely in love with the whole alexa collection
11942,0,i would like her to be able to hook up to apps i have on my ipad & i have not been able to do that yet.  that is siticher radio
11943,4,works great!
11944,1,echo is the best great sound
11945,9,this was a gift from our daughter. we like it.
11946,14,"alexa will not set up events for me. every time i set an event, appointment, it repeats it, but never reminds me. too late to return it. i am not happy."
11947,10,"handy and makes life interesting, but it has run through as the puns and jokes it knows. apparently getting new or adding additional not a top priority."
11948,14,"for seniors, it is too difficult to get calendar to work with iphone. i called tech support without getting it done. i like playing the music and making phone calls."
11949,11,love my new echo so much we bought a third one for the house.
11950,1,like the more compact size. sound quality is great when playing music.
11951,10,i love the sound !! it is also fun to use the kids get a kick out of it
11952,9,it is pretty cool to have her around.
11953,3,i love it! good buy!!!! would recommend it to all!!!
11954,0,"the sound is good, but what i do not like is that the system does not react to my request. it is really a waste of my money because of this."
11955,7,alexa echo went very easy to install it works great i am enjoying the music the news all the information i need in my life plus i can order stuff thank you !!<f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+008a>
11956,11,sound is really underwhelming. as a connected device amazon is great but i wanted a speaker and this falls way short.
11957,4,kinda difficult to set up
11958,14,"pretty much used every day. it occasionally misses its 'wake word,' especially if music is on louder side"
11959,7,love it! great sound. liked it so much ordered a second one for my parents as a gift. they love it as well! <f0><u+009f><u+0091><u+008d>
11960,12,it is a process.  i learn more each day.
11961,0,wish alexa had more information
11962,10,i love the sound! i love asking for any music and having it play whatever i want. i have not really found anything about it i do not like!
11963,0,want to hear specific pieces of classical music buy specific performers. could not. also could not get information on local restaurants.
11964,10,the amazon echo is a lt of fun to interact with. there are a great number of skills alex can learn and the trivia games are challenging.
11965,0,"all you have to do is name a song, and it is played for you"
11966,1,it is great
11967,10,able to play siriusxm with great sound.she answers a lot of questions instantly.great side kick.
11968,4,"works very well, easy to set up, lots of volume options, and looks nicer than a lot of other smart speakers."
11969,14,love my echo! have her a dot and lucky enough to get a show for christmas!
11970,10,i think it is a wonderful asset to my home¡¦ i would like more emails on what it is capable of doing
11971,10,this is amazing !its changed the way i listen to music.....
11972,5,bought it as a gift for my son. he is very happy with it.
11973,14,liked :the things i could do and access once i  was finally connected.disliked :getting set up connected was painful and very frustrating.
11974,5,this was a christmas gift i love it
11975,14,love it! just have to make sure i speak towards it if further than about 10' away.
11976,9,i love my echo....ordered one for my mom and a friend. can not wait to learn everything it can do.
11977,0,alexa is amazing.  love it.  building my smart home bit by bit so she can do more.
11978,14,i think?????  i just can not understand the book.  i have tried.  i t seems as thou i need to buy other pieces.  do you have an instructor?
11979,8,love it
11980,14,i cant listen any music from amazon prime music.i want to pay with my credit card but not possible.but that charge 12.99 for prime membership how is possible?
11981,10,fun device and the sound is very good. like the way she can respond to my questions. the sound from echo is just as good as my bose.  best invention ever.
11982,5,granddaughter loves it!
11983,11,"sounds great, better than the 1st generation."
11984,0,everything except when i ask to play albert king music she always play some one else i lone albert king other wise i love it
11985,9,"i got it for a christmas gift, but it definitely was one of the best christmas gifts i have received it does eveything for me, it is definitely worth it!"
11986,14,"when it works i love it. it does not stay connected.  i called support, had already did the suggestions on website and redid them at your suggestion.  help!"
11987,3,does everything as advertise
11988,0,"has some great features, but did not do everything i expected from this unit. most features has to be downloaded from our own phone or use other equipment."
11989,14,it is a nice addition and easy to work with. i will never use the camera on future echo devises in the home. only down side is alexa reacts to her prompt from the tv.
11990,1,love it. love it. love it!! the sound and clarity is awesome!!
11991,9,"my children have me am echo for christmas, i just love it. i use it everyday."
11992,10,loved the quickness of fast selection of music for listening at different points of the day depending on my mood at the moment.
11993,0,"dont get me wrong, i like it. but its hard to get her to understand what music i want to hear!"
11994,9,great thanks
11995,0,"we enjoy the unlimited apple music and we ask occasional questions and weather, but not sure of all it is capsbili"
11996,5,christmas gift to my mother. she uses it everyday!love it!
11997,10,my fiancee currently lives in another state and i bought this for her i love being able to leave her messages and we talk on it alot.
11998,3,great sound and alexa just makes life easier
11999,8,i love it
12000,11,the sound + the ai are much better than my smaller ble speaker. i wish it can understand other language as well.
12001,10,we love it. easy to setup and use. i like playing jeopardy with alexa
12002,14,must say alexa first ! before anything.....great ai....
12003,11,outstanding sound and very responsive.  this replaced my old bose wave radio in the kitchen.
12004,1,great quality sound
12005,10,"love that i can listen to music, make list and my kids love playing jeopardy."
12006,10,awesome!
12007,11,the 2 gen echo sound is much much better.  with the improved bass response i find myself looking for more reasons to play music.
12008,0,it is a lot of fun!  the only thing i do not like is it has to be plugged in to use it.
12009,14,it is awesome! easy to set up with your phone. it is very loud and clear. best part about it is that i can be clear across the room and alexa understands me clearly!
12010,8,great love it
12011,14,this device is a great product. once alexa gets you and your families voices down and understandable your needs to even better!
12012,10,it is still early win the game.  i have enjoyed it  so far.
12013,9,i love my echo. i find it very entertaining and amusing. i plan to purchase more to give as gifts.
12014,14,i lo e alexa she stays on top of thing
12015,9,i bought  echo (2nd generation) for my sons for christmas. they love them. guess i will have to buy me one now.
12016,10,enjoying this echo very much.  love that i can ask for any music and get it instantly.
12017,10,i personally love it. especially because i can since it to my older echo and play music or call my daughter from either area.. plus her bose speaker is wonderful...
12018,10,i absolutely love my ¡°alexa¡± i can not imagine how i would feel if i did not have her! now i have fantastic music all day!
12019,12,"still experimenting with it, but it is really fun so far!  have just scratched the surface of what it can do!"
12020,8,love it
12021,0,would not stop playing music till i unplugged it
12022,10,"i love the convenience of my echo, and am using it more each day for music, news, to answer questions, and to assist me with list making and reminders."
12023,10,using the amazon echo has been a big addition to the daily routines and assisting in getting things done quickly and easily.
12024,12,i love it! it does more than i imagined!
12025,10,she is so full of knowledge with a sense of humor. love that amazon sends frequent updates on what alexa can do
12026,14,the best part is ease of use the worst part is trying to connect to wi-fi. it nends more detail in the instructions.
12027,11,great volume! and voice recognition at a whisper!! buy one now!!! love it!
12028,4,"entertaining, useful and fun"
12029,14,every thing stunk i already sold it on ebay i found alexa to be nothing but garbage. and apple homepod is better . siri rules alexa dumb
12030,14,we do not use it much but everytime our grandkids come over it is going constantly!
12031,11,this speaker is the bomb i liked it so much i bought another one it sounds great.
12032,14,disappointed.  almost sent it back.
12033,14,great sound!!! i am often using this instead of bose sound link speakers that i have.
12034,14,"no good ,please no buy"
12035,1,love the color and how the amazon echo works
12036,0,i like how she can hear in loud places. one thing that i really dislike is having to pay extra for the amazon unlimited even if i already have amazon prime
12037,9,we love our alexa. very easy to work and her games and knowledge are fun. and of course the music. my only complaint is the sound quality.
12038,3,the future is here! remarkable tool for my home. user friendly as well as sophisticated equipment.sincerelyphilipp limmajor usafretired
12039,1,cool product!!
12040,0,doesnt seem to know as much as i expected
12041,5,this was a christmas present for my daughter and son-inlaw and they are very pleased.
12042,5,great sound quality. great funmade wonderful christmas gifts
12043,9,my kids love it!  a must for the fam!
12044,10,"this is so much fun. we use her for our alarm , to play music, look up random trivia and so on. my grand kids love it."
12045,14,"it does everything it promises. i have recently added smart bulbs to my home, and it is awesome!"
12046,0,"okay, good for music. good sound. google is 3 times smarter."
12047,9,it is like part of the family now :;)
12048,14,like being able to select the music pieces i like.not happy that to receive the music i wish to select i had to purchase a compatible program.<f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0095>
12049,14,excellent sound quality. i wish the wake word was more customizable.
12050,10,got it as a gift and plays great music that i request and love the ¡°company¡±
12051,5,this was a christmas present she loves the sound
12052,9,"great product. hooks up easily, sounds great for what it is."
12053,8,this thing is awesome!!!  my kids love it!!
12054,10,"love it. got it as a gift and it is great. sometimes alexa misbehaves but i love the voice command for music, alarm and answers to questions."
12055,14,i like but having problems with it staying connected to wifi
12056,8,i love it.....
12057,0,it is not versatile enough in normal conversational speech queries.  it requires to follow certain kind of speech pattern for it to understand requests or queries.
12058,0,it does not seem to have answers to our questions. we get a lot of i do not know that. i love the music when i ask for it.
12059,11,alexa locks up and can not her/ understand my voice commands more than half of the time.  the sound is great but the voice command needs much improvement.
12060,10,i am really enjoying the echo.  it is really helpful when making dinner and i need a quick sauce recipe or salad dressing. alexis gives me a top recipe quickly.
12061,14,everything
12062,3,i love the alexa. would highly reccomend it is much better than siri
12063,0,"do not find it particualry usefulthe app is on my phone,every time i give an instruction it is recorded on my phone.how do i clear this?"
12064,13,i love mine
12065,14,i love this
12066,1,works great. good sound quality.
12067,9,bought multiple echos to fill the house with music and easy access.  sounds great.  would really like to see a
12068,0,sound is a lot better. not understanding your voice and having to repeat commands.
12069,5,"this was bought as an xmas gift for my son and daughter in law, they love it.  are moving to japan soon so hope it works well there also."
12070,11,i purchased three of the devices. the silver finish device responds the best. but the walnut device has some issues with response
12071,11,"wow, the sound is so much better then the original echo"
12072,14,we cannot hook it up to anything we own not compatible.
12073,0,"i like the features the most, the thing i like least is sometimes alexa talks in the middle of the night and no one had ask a question."
12074,9,it was a christmas gift for my husband and he loved it. he lives to listen to music so he can pick his choice and ask alexa to play it.
12075,10,"great addition to our home. our daughters love to ask alexa to play music for them, ask it questions and order pizza. money well spent."
12076,10,sound quality is wonderful! so easy to listen to music anywhere in the house now. and it is so much fun to ask alexa random questions to see how she will answer!
12077,11,have a gen 1 that seems to hear commands better.  do not understand why.  but do like the size better.
12078,10,i did not make a purchase of an alexa. it was a gift and i really do not use it. it just sits on a table. my grandkids have fun asking it random questions.
12079,14,needs help because it is easily confused and 'does not get it' as a reply..many generations to become better....if this the best ai around we are in trouble
12080,9,"my family loves this so much. the speakers alone are worth more than what we paid! so, so happy!"
12081,0,does not get my commands very well and needs to be trained a lot. i have 3 in my house and they merge out of nowhere and constantly have to be separating.
12082,14,i have had my eye on this device since it first came out. i am still figuring out all its capabilities but so far it is great! i really like it is versatility. five stars!
12083,11,i love my echo. has great sound. it is very responsive. goes with the color scheme of my desk/work area. absolutely recommend it.
12084,10,"we love our alexa! how easy to use, to set time , reminders, look up a recipe and much more.."
12085,14,instructions should have more detailed information
12086,1,perfect and fun
12087,11,much more capability than i expexted
12088,11,"this echo has much better sound than the dots we have, also love the fabric covers!"
12089,11,"love the echo! better sound quality than the dot, by far & very versatile."
12090,1,sound quality is great and so useful. love it!
12091,9,"perfect in every way. used as a gift  the receiving family uses it daily, adults and children."
12092,1,we love our echo (2nd generation)! the sound quality is great and alexa is a wealth of great music and information!
12093,10,i love it! sound is great. it can hear you in other rooms of the house.
12094,14,"disappointed.  here i thought generation 2 was supposed to be better than generation 1.  does not appear to be so.  this device lives by its speaker and microphone.  but generation 2 is volume is 2 thirds of the generation 1 model.  and the microphone seems to barely understand what i am saying.  even though generation 2 is aethetically more appealing, the volume and microphone difficiency makes it only suitable for quiet environments.  i was going to replace generation 2 with generation 2 in my living room, but i decioded to put generation 2 in the bedroom where it is quieter.  i could not put it in the living room with the tv as i could not hear it even at maximum volume.  and it was not able to understand me as i had to repeat myself at higher volume myself for it to perform.  i do not have to do this with the generation one model.  i guess thaty is the reason generation 2 is half the price of generation 1.bottom line:  unless you plan to use this in a rather quiet environment, either wait, get the echo dot, or get echo 1st generation."
12095,14,it works great when it is not malfunctioning.  seems to have alot of glitches. once these stop happening it should be a great device with good sound.
12096,0,"it does sound good is what i like. i do not like how limited the answers are we have asked lots of questions that get answered ""i do not know that"""
12097,9,"it is ok, but not something i would ever buy. it was a gift from my son."
12098,0,voice a little hard to understand sometimes.
12099,11,excellent sounds great this is my second one
12100,10,"love my echo/alexa, use it every day"
12101,1,great product!
12102,14,this was a gift for my son did not realize you had to subscribe to all the different things to actually enjoy.
12103,0,"i can not get certain songs, like september song by willy nelson, only a sample. i am not sure why.  otherwise, i have no complaints.  thank you!"
12104,7,love it! clear sound easy to use and also with the app on your phone.  <f0><u+009f><u+0091><u+008c>
12105,11,great sound quality; ease and convenience of alexa. no issues here.
12106,14,"all i can say is, it is incredible. just use it as intended and it will do it is job."
12107,14,i¡¯m no longer able to get amazon music unlimited. signed up for free 30 day trial. had it for only 10 days. no more amazon music. help is unavailable. i¡¯m annoyed
12108,10,"i love my echo. music streaming, making phone calls, playing jeopardy!"
12109,10,it has been fun for both my wife and i. we ask alexa the question of the day every morning. we also use the nature is sounds at night.
12110,4,"it is great easy to,use lots of information once you learn how it works."
12111,14,these worked perfect for our trip to california and we have used them a few times for swimming at the rec. awesome for capturing the moments!
12112,3,not as great as advertised; certainly not as good as google for info and music.
12113,1,incredible sound from something so small and just a lot of fun and convenience.
12114,10,great product.  wonderful sound system.  love that i can request any type of music that i want at anytime.
12115,1,great device for a reasonable price. great sound. useful for playing music around house while on a budget.

12120,10,"i am like have it ,keep me or husband, enjoy by yourself"
12121,10,i like that it plays music from my pandora stations. all i have to do is ask. i am still learning about it is many uses. over all i am very satisfied.
12122,10,love the ability to listen to all types of music hands free. still learning some things but overall we are really enjoying the echo. highly recommend it.
12123,3,it is everything i had expected.
12124,1,the sound quality is very good.
12125,9,"love this device! 1st time owning an echo, my wife and i love the features you can use with it, turned our home into a smart house with this too. totally worth $100!"
12126,14,do not like that it talks without talking to it music sounds great sitting in living room and randomly talks
12127,0,this item seems to be working very well.  it is sensitive even hears when the word alexa is used on the tv it lights up.  tv is about 15 feet away.  so funny.
12128,14,does not do a whole lot. i can not link the rooms and the music select is terrible
12129,10,it is amazing . goodbye bose.
12130,10,definitely a nice to have not a need to have.  lots of entertainment. love the music feature. able to hear songs i have not heard since i was a kid.
12131,14,compact great sound.  a little bit hard to setup with a echo and echo dot. called got great people to help. would recommend this product to anyone.
12132,0,"sound is good, but wish trebble and bass were adjustable.  alexa seems to turn on by herself at times.  not sure if she is picking up cues from tv."
12133,0,"surprised by the amount if questions it can not answer and by the same token, the things it cn answer.  fun little addition."
12134,5,i received it as a gift and was so pleased i gave it as gift.  no complaints.
12135,9,sounds great and works well.  received it in 1 day.  very pleased.  a lot of fun interactive games for adults and kids.
12136,1,great product
12137,12,"a must have, fun to see what is new each week."
12138,5,very nice!! likes my daughter.
12139,10,love this thing for music!
12140,1,great experience
12141,12,so far we are very happy with echo.  we have not had it long but look forward to enjoying it as we learn more about it.
12142,11,the sound when playing music is multi-dimensional.  much improved from the original model.love all the features.
12143,9,i have the new echo (2nd gen) and 2 echo dots (2nd gen) in my home and we love them. sound is awesome and we have fun communicating them.
12144,1,i love this alexa echo is amazing! music sounds wonderful
12145,0,does not understand me very well sometimes but otherwise works fine
12146,0,really like music via bluetooth but can not get sirius xm to play i have tried the linking but still will not connect.
12147,14,i was disappointed that it could not control my dish tv hopper 3 better.  could not go to my saved recordings or browse them or play them.
12148,9,"awesome smart speaker, great sound when you have two in the room. smart devices are fun and convenient. also made great christmas gifts."
12149,0,convenient-likesays hello in middle of night-dislike
12150,8,"awesome device, love it."
12151,8,awesome
12152,12,love ¡°alexa¡± learning to do more & more w her every day
12153,11,our second unit and this new one is even better that the first one. great!!!
12154,14,"the product is nice but a better sound speaker is needed, also the unit speaker should stay on or have a option to stay on when connected to a bluetooth speaker"
12155,10,i love the sound and the capabilities of the unit. alexa just cracks me up and amazes me with her wisdom.i have no complaints. got my money is worth.
12156,10,fantastic sound and great at setting alarms. i enjoy the music as well
12157,10,love it. i ask for dance music to dance to.
12158,0,it nice to have ask question and get answers play musica lot of times it does not understand the question
12159,3,does everything it advertised to do
12160,14,"i hope i am wrong but i am pretty sure i am not - this product has no way to play sound from youtube, no aux in, and requires it to be plugged into the wall.  like most of amazon is products it is not user friendly.  i asked for this for christmas and got it as a gift and it does not even do what my $10 bluetooth speaker i bought on black friday does (although it does sound a little better).  i do not  think there is a way to simply bluetooth my phone (or ipad) to this  and have the sound come out of the alexa instead of my phone but hopefully i am wrong and i just can not find the answer anywhere.when trying to browse my (limited) music on the alexa app while playing it or pandora stations i was not able to see my library on the phone so you  basically have to know what you want and ask for it.  maybe after doing a lot of research i will find something useful about this but so far it is pretty limited.  sound quality is okay but a $30 set of bluetooth speakers probably sounds just as good and i am not sure how it compares to version 1."
12161,14,"this thing is awesome, not to tech savvy but easy to set up then a breeze to operate. it is really handy once you get the initial playing with it out of your system."
12162,14,"new, different kind of electronics, could get response/answers quicker than phone or computer."
12163,14,great sound which is available over one third of the house. sometimes alexa says she can not play an album which i request even though we are testing amazon prime.
12164,14,"lives up to the expectations of echo. very reliable. no problems so far. it is worth the money if you enjoy music, games, netflix, etc. very satisfied with alexa."
12165,0,absolutely love it! though i didnt know it before i bought it that you get suckered to pay $3.99 a month from amazon to play music which is what i wanted it for.
12166,0,"awesome sound, responds fast and 10 times better than google home."
12167,12,really do not know what  to do with it
12168,14,love the quality of sound that echo 2 produces.  added benefit was the ability to connect echo to our intercom system.
12169,14,"my kids drove me nuts with it at first. but once the novelty wore off, it was a great gift for everyone in the house. we all use it."
12170,0,"alexa is vaunted reservoir of knowledge is a myth.  her most common answer to questions is, ¡°i do not know that.¡±  very disappointing."
12171,1,we love our alexa! awesome product to have at home..very helpful too!
12172,10,my husband and i love it it is everything you need to keep you entertained from jokes and trivia to the weather and shopping lists.
12173,1,sound quality very good.
12174,10,great soundi have not used it for other than play music
12175,14,"still in the learning process, so i am not sure what it can and cannot do.  will not pair up to my nest thermostat, but it does on my phone app.  why is that happening?"
12176,2,i love everything about alexa!
12177,10,i have been eyeing these since the beginning and am so glad i waited! i love the look and alexa has so many great features.
12178,14,just a more expensive fire tv stick . i hope it would be a new version  and a upgrade of the second generation fire tv which i loved.
12179,14,product works well with the wi-fi connection. i only use it for weather and traffic information at this time. handy to have around.
12180,11,i love this size! its not too big and still makes great sound in a large room!
12181,1,"great sound, i like the skills. my wife and i love using it."
12182,4,great product to have. .
12183,14,alexa is skills are a ton of fun and she come packed with plenty of knowledge but the ability to search the internet for answers needs to be filled
12184,10,"great sound, i use my echo to listen to audiobooks.  i also love having the ability to create my to-do list and shopping list by talking to alexa!"
12185,12,its amazing what it can do.i love it
12186,14,"scope  of music availability.  do  not like not having  a remote and some type of ""dial"" to adjust music volume other than a plus or minus sign."
12187,0,sounds better after they updated software every now and then she does not like to respond.
12188,1,still just as great and fun! such a great gift!
12189,10,i can get a radio station i can not get on my radio
12190,11,convenient.sound is decent.certainly not great
12191,11,"good sound for the size and good looking. i wish it had the rotary volume control, like the original eco."
12192,14,i am disappointed that i cannot play music from my android smartphone music library on my echo.
12193,11,need deeper bass.
12194,0,it is totally awesome mind blowing i can not wait to connect more appliances to it thank you
12195,11,i do not have other devices of this nature to compare with but i do like the echo and my echo dot.
12196,12,i love my echo. it has great sound and does exactly what i need it to do. :)
12197,9,so much fun!!! love having her in my kitchen
12198,14,i have enjoyed it very much. i play all kinds of music on it. i have one lamp hooked to it. it works 99% of the time. i have not added any more yet.
12199,14,loved the ease with which i set it up. loved the sound quality. dot terrible for music. i do not even use it anymore anywhere. waste of my money!!!!
12200,14,a+
12201,0,was impressed how far away o could be and it still hears me.  a little disappointed in how many times it says sorry i do not know that one.
12202,5,my best friend love mine
12203,10,a lot of fun!  enjoyed listening to music.
12204,0,product works as advertised. fun to play with but of what use it is to me still uncertain.
12205,8,love it great
12206,5,my family loves this
12207,0,we like the echo it is pretty cool all the things it can do.  just remember alexa does not know everything or on occasion it does not answer my questions correctly.
12208,10,"love it! turns on lights, plays music sets timer, keeps grocery list. i love it!"
12209,8,love it
12210,14,ability to easily link smart plugs was a great feature.  no link or integration with directv or to play music that is stored on my phone is a definate downside.
12211,14,awesome product. works perfectly with my voice even though i am not a native english speaker.
12212,10,so far we love having alexa in our home.
12213,8,i love this product!

12217,10,"it is a great tool when my hands are busy with the children but i can make changes to the tv, the music and even turn in the lights"
12218,3,works great
12219,14,it is good technology ... should include ability to change voices and  names in a future upgrade
12220,12,have not used it for much more than playing pandora so far.. but like.
12221,12,love it and use it all the time
12222,0,i have not really found many uses for this other than a radio and weather checker.  device turns off randomly when i am listening to music.
12223,11,"even after end of last years audio firmwear update, the sound is really so so. it lackas bass and depth."
12224,9,got a good  deal on 2 of them. easy to set up. having fun with them. great sound quality for the  price.
12225,9,bought one for xmas and i absolutely love it.  i am buying another one for my son.  very happy with her!

12234,14,"i was charged the full amount of $ 100.00 , instead of 4 payments, like advertised.i want a $ 75 dollars refund"
12235,0,"we love her!  she wakes up when she hears her name in tv, but never responds."
12236,14,"disappointed in fact that you must subscribe to spotify premium to use spotify service, also disappointed i am unable to play my itunes through the speakers as well."
12237,10,"i love my alexa, she keeps me updated with weather, news and music. the only problem i have with her is that she does not vacuum or do dishes!!!!!"
12238,10,i can ask anything and got answers
12239,11,the sound quality is very good.  still exploring all the different skills of the echo (2nd generation).
12240,10,i love how you can ask her to spell words for you and i love being able to set alarms and timers!! it is just so helpful and convenient
12241,0,have to teach it all the skills. works well as a bluetooth speaker...
12242,9,we love our echo.  it is great for my husband to use since he is blind.  this has been a blessing for us.
12243,10,l like being able to play a variety of music by voice and getting virtuallyany information without lifting a finger.
12244,0,"it has not been able to understand questions or requests. even after trying to rephrase questions, i get the same answers."

12254,9,i love my echo...it is the best present that i received for christmas from my husband. we ordered another for our daughter.
12255,14,alexa could not hear me while i was in the same room. she did not answer basic questions. not a good product. very upset. returned it back to the store.
12256,10,being able to ask it simple questions like the weather or what time it is and my one year old demands to listen to music every morning ¢½
12257,10,"installed our second alexa, a gift.  easy to install.  we enjoy the music, getting the news and weather in the morning and so much more!"
12258,0,the voice recognition can be improved also they should add more languages. alexa sometimes does not understands commands.
12259,11,i love my echo 2nd generation.  great sound and i really enjoy the voice command.
12260,4,easy to set up and use.
12261,12,still learning but so far it is great!

12263,14,"the first echo we received did not work, it was returned and a second one was sent to us. the second one was a little difficult to activate, but it works fine."
12264,0,"every time i ask a question all i get is ""i do not know about that"" i ask to have a song played and all i get is ""here is a sample of that song""."
12265,10,not at all good
12266,10,"we enjoy using alexa very much.  easy to set up, answers most inquiries, plays great music, etc. etc. etc."
12267,10,"i love alexa.  she answers almost everything you ask, plays music, weather fore cast, jokes, etc, etc.  so happy with my purchase."
12268,14,like most: performance. least:  setup. had to call tech support.

12270,14,will not connect to a second phone.  we have only had for 2 months and it will not keep a charge.  as soon as we unplug it dies.
12271,10,the speaker is excellent. the ability to play from spotify is nice. getting morning new headlines and weather is convenient. glad i made this purchase!

12291,14,excellent i have continued to create automated fun stuff for my kids they like hearing alexa talk to them. very entertaining for the kiddos and parents as well.
12292,11,the audio ( music) of the echo (2nd generation) provides excellent listening pleasure.  the device also assimilates perfectly into any household surroundings.
12293,14,this worked really well for about a month but now can not get any music except iheart radio without paying a monthly charge for amazon music
12294,0,i love the echo only thing irritating  is sometimes you have to ask the question  in a different way  3 to 4 times before she understands.
12295,10,they love it! have lots of fun asking it questions and what not!
12296,9,my daughter bought this for me for the holiday. i could not of asked for a better present. this thing is incredible.
12297,3,"i really thought this thing would be smarter than siri, and unfortunately it is infinitely stupider. yes, i said stupider."
12298,0,"love it, wish i was more savvy about stuff like this, i¡¯m sure i¡¯m not getting everything out of it that it is capable of."
12299,2,love it! alexa is my friend! lol!

12308,0,"it is nice if you have questions and can just ask alexa. do not make her mad though, she will not argue with you lol!!"
12309,14,very responsive to voice commands. first used primarily for music. recently added home automation process. process was very easy and loving it.

12314,10,i amsatisfied. it is what i want when i am at home.
12315,14,i am unable to use both echo dot & 2nd generation simultaniously.  2nd generation does not seem as easy or effective as dot.
12316,9,"it was easy to set up and works like a charm. very happy with alexa and her little friend, dot."
12317,14,alexa is awesome! the app not so much app works very slow and is a little hard to navigate also the unit should come with a remote
12318,5,my husband loved this as a christmas gift.
12319,10,fabulous
12320,10,terrific
12321,9,"love this!!  can learn from, funny & someone who will listen to you."

12325,11,"quality product with great sounding music, very booming and resounding bass.  well worth the upgrade from the 1st gen."
12326,11,sound is better than the dot. i love having both going at the same time though for the stereo feeling
12327,0,listens and respomds wisely. great devise to use with many skills and apps
12328,5,my mother loves it.. great gift.

12331,0,i gave it three stars because sound is great but she does not understand a lot of things yet
12332,1,great size.  it is attractive..  great sound.  very impressed with the subjects it will respond to.

12334,14,"price was very affordable and the sound quality seems awesome at any level! bass thou seems to be a little flat, thou for a device so compact great quality!!!!!"
12335,12,"a lot of the apps ¡°skills¡± are still works in progress and do not have a lot of functionalities/commands but overall, it is cool device"
12336,14,"had a rough start when setting up the app on my tablet, but once i set it up on my laptop i was good to go.  sound quality is good, still learning all it can do"
12337,1,love the easy access to music. the sound quality is excellent.
12338,0,very good sound quality i just wish it came with instructions on how to us it.

12350,1,great device and quality speakers as well as elegant looks and good functionality.
12351,14,could not see the purpose for this for years. picked up 2 on black friday special and i am a believer now.
12352,14,"in many countries, a.i. speaker products are pouring out. you have to expand the serviceable range of echo quickly."
12353,12,very handy device.  it can do much to simplify controlling information around the home.  still have much to discover and explore
12354,10,an amazing addition to our home.  easy to use and the sound is wonderful.  i have to brush up on the jeopardy questions however!
12355,10,love our alexa! so fun and funny! kids love asking her to tell them jokes and i love the music and weather options!
12356,9,set up took 5 minutes and my dad loves it.  was the best christmas gift with surprisingly good sound for it is size.
12357,12,it is great once i learn how to use all the functions on it..:)
12358,9,best sound ever!! do not know how i made it without the echo 2!
12359,0,i am not blown away just yet. takes a little while to set up and understand what its capable of doing.
12360,1,a very fun addition to the home!
12361,10,love my echo!  the sound is phenomenal for music or informational answers.
12362,10,"love my echo. so convenient to hear music, the news and weather on demand."
12363,0,so far so good. just takes time to get used to and ask the right questions. should get better with time.
12364,12,love it still learning about it
12365,8,love it!
12366,10,love love love this echo! alexa listens and gives great suggestions for recipes. i will be getting the dots for around the house!

12368,10,love mine so much!  responds great to my requests and the sound is amazing and loud when playing music
12369,0,"she is great ,but she does make a lot of excuses that she does not know some things ,is there a man version ,so at least he would lie with a dumb answer."
12370,1,just a great product that has terrific sound quality for the price and great ai. highly recommended for the amazon prime / amazon music subscribers.
12371,12,"i am still learning about how to use alexa.  i am not really a ""techy"" so i know that i am not using it to my capacity.  i think i need an echo tutor."
12372,10,having fun with echosetup just a little intimidating for us older people.
12373,0,"this baby is dope af! she loud and proud! although you can not sync spotify and alexa, you just have to play it through bluetooth, other than that...she nice"
12374,4,"so easy to set up, works great and fun to talk to"
12375,9,i love my echo!  i had been asking for one for awhile and finally got one.
12376,11,the new echo is shorter and has the ability to change skins which is nice for looks and placement in a room. the best feature is the sound being better.
12377,11,iove it. music all over the house.
12378,1,excellent product- great sound
12379,8,love it
12380,9,i bought this for my 84 year old mom for christmas. she loves it! she uses it to check the weather and the news. she plays music with it most often.
12381,10,i like all amazon items. its the best
12382,12,"i am really enjoying my echo. i still have not utilized it as often as i would like, but so far, i am pleased with it."
12383,11,"i think it sounds better than the first,but still could use more base.overall,a great way to listen to music if you are not a fanatic about sound."
12384,3,i did not think i would like it but i really enjoy it!
12385,9,love it! i gave it as a gift to my boyfriend and it is so useful in our everyday lives.  great to listen to music. there is so much alexa can do.
12386,10,i enjoy the ease of use.  it is great for listening to music and flash briefings.  there are still many uses i am looking forward to discovering.
12387,14,this is my 4th device in this product line i really like my echo devices.
12388,8,i love this item.
12389,8,i love everything
12390,11,it is smaller and blends in better.
12391,3,thank you
12392,9,this was purchased as a gift for my sister. she says she is enjoying using it a lot in her home. she is constantly asking alexa for info and receiving answers!
12393,12,"still learning everything this device can do, but so far i really like it. set up was easy and the sound from the speaker is actually very good for it is size."
12394,14,"looks good, works well, just not with older netgear products. besides needing to inform customers of the netgear issue it works as intended."
12395,14,"this product has limited use unless you purchase more ""smart"" items for it to connect with.i consider it more of a novelty than anything else."
12396,10,"excellent device, trouble free."
12397,9,very cool gadget. purchased one for my visually impaired mom and she lives it.
12398,0,worked great for about a month.  now when you ask questions there is a pause or it just does not answer.
12399,9,love it!  i can do so much with alexa she fit right into our life and made things so much easier in so many ways.
12400,10,me and my mom are so happy that we got it. it helps it with a lot of things. also it plays every song we ask it to
12401,9,great sound. have no least likes. 100% satified..
12402,1,we love it!great addition to our household.
12403,12,"i am still in the process of learning all of echo is capabilities, but have really been enjoying the musical selections available upon request!"
12404,1,love the product and the price was the icing on the cake.
12405,14,i like the features of request and games. the least is that it only works with power chord. the tap echo did not need a cord only to charge.
12406,10,love it!  my husband can play all of his favorite ¡°oldies¡± whenever he wants and i like that alexa will remind us of important events that need to be done!
12407,10,i love her
12408,14,very great for bedrooms and small living rooms. one problem is the device will not hear me if i¡¯m around 10 feet away. otherwise it is a nice thing to have!
12409,11,my first echo. as of now i am very satisfied with this product. i am also the owner of 2 echo dots.
12410,14,there are real problems with echo streaming.  audio breaking up makes this product often unusable and amazon help advice does not correct the problem.
12411,11,great sound. as good as the bigger alexa.
12412,3,it was exactly what i thiught it wiuld be!
12413,14,ok it does not really connect well with a hot spot
12414,10,we like everything about it! especially the jokes
12415,10,i am very pleased with the echo.  use it as a radio to keep my dogs entertained.  it works as an alarm clock and helps me spell words for scrabble.
12416,0,"i like how loud and clear the sound out of the speaker comes out, but it seems alexa herself needs to be a bit more sensitive after i call for her."
12417,0,overall good product. does what it claims to do. the ai on this device is ok but i was expecting it to be better at follow up questions. the sound is not bad but not great.
12418,4,love it.  easy to set up!
12419,4,item exceeded expectations. great sound quality!
12420,3,ok so far.
12421,9,amazing device !!! do not buy the dots get these worth the extra money !!!
12422,14,i feel it is a little pricey but for the most part i am happy with it.
12423,12,i love this product. i am still learning all it is capable of doing.
12424,11,"good sound quality for the size, but bass can be overpowering on some music."
12425,0,"great product, we have a lot of fun with alexa. and we use it a lot but.... you have to be very clear when you speak. and very specific when you ask something."
12426,1,amazing speaker!!!
12427,2,we love our eco is.
12428,10,awesome hand free to do anything highly recommend this
12429,10,"features l like most are playing music and making my shopping list. use it numerous times everyday, can not imagine being with out it."
12430,9,im actually impressed with our echos. ive got two echos and three dots and they are pretty sweet. our family definitely puts them to good use!
12431,10,"love that i can play music to listen to without touching it, but dont like how i have to install apps on my phone to do so"
12432,10,"love it - so nice to have music, weather and news instantly!"
12433,11,better looking system and sound is great.
12434,1,shipped fast. great sound. great source of information from this device. my whole family loves this device!!
12435,10,amazing ai
12436,10,"love it, really useful and the ability to drop in on kids acting up is great!"
12437,0,needs more stuff to do without having appliances. such as internet info.but overall i love it it can be helpful.
12438,9,i have so much  fun with  my echo  2nd gen. you must  have  one to understand  all the things  alexa  can now do
12439,11,sounds great.  but it responds slower then echo dot.
12440,7,"i would give it a 10 if i could, frickin' love it,  told my daughter she kicked it out of the park on this gift. as my wife says ""alexa, play disco"" <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0080>"
12441,3,"i like what it does but , i thought it would do more though."
12442,2,love our alexa
12443,0,"amazing that alexa can find nearly any ""oldie but goodie"" song right away and then play it with great fidelity -- love it!"
12444,9,love it. music and information are tied for which we use the most
12445,14,this thing is awesome. the mic can pick up from other rooms and speakers are great. now i need echo dots
12446,2,met all of my expectations.
12447,12,"we are still learning how to use it, but find a new surprise nearly everyday."
12448,7,"easy to set up, trouble free during operation, plus i think alexa likes me.<f0><u+009f><u+00a4><u+00aa>"
12449,2,i love my echo. great product!
12450,10,"we love it for the music, you can get most songs to play."
12451,2,i love the alexa
12452,1,"sound quality is good and it works fine.  the voice recognition is good, but not perfect."
12453,0,"i have not had it very long so just learning what it can do.  however, i love the fact i can ask it to play music!"
12454,1,great item
12455,14,what a nice machine. became a must see and use by any people visiting our house. becomes the center of attention.
12456,0,does not respond to many of my commands.its like she always gives me a completely random answer most of the time.
12457,12,sounds much better than i expected. still learning all of her tricks.
12458,8,love it!
12459,9,this echo has a terrific sound. i listen to music on it all the time. surprised by how well it does sound. i would buy another one of these.
12460,10,my daughter loves it! it met our expectations and gets alotta use in the household. it was easy to set up and program. well worth the money.
12461,14,audio sounds good but sometime alex is a little slow responding for my taste.  was also hoping programming and ai was more advanced.
12462,14,there is not much more to say about alexa except that what are the best products in the last 20 years
12463,8,works great
12464,2,magical device...meet george jetson :-)
12465,12,love this thing!  can not find enough things to do with it!!!!
12466,10,it is great. every time i want music i do not have to put a cd in.
12467,0,"love it!!! amazing how sensitive the microphone is, do not even need to be close for it to understand your requests!"
12468,4,i love my echo! nice sound quality and easy to use
12469,9,shocked by the sound quality! it was that good. we use it as a kitchen speaker/information center!
12470,1,this is cool technology. the music is our favorite.
12471,12,loving it!  we are still getting familiar with all echo can do.  the sound is amazing.
12472,14,"great for music, unfortunately i set up at one location and then moved 250 miles. alexia still thinks. i am at my old location."
12473,5,"bought for my mother for christmas, she loves it and uses it daily."
12474,14,unable to get it to connect with my internet properly where you can just call out to it.
12475,0,"the echo was a gift. it was a little challenging to set up. i only ask it to do two basic things at this time and it works fine, i enjoy the echo."
12476,10,still learning all its uses. love the way she answers all our questions and plays our favorite songswhile we are working in the house.
12477,1,"love it, good sound and quality."

12484,5,bought for my daughter who lives in another state. she likes it
12485,11,usic sounds fabulous and spreads throughout the first floor . i look forward to using. ore feature
12486,3,it does what i need it to do. sound quality is ok could be a lot better.
12487,9,"i love echo dot and the echo, i have them both."
12488,14,the echo works great i interested in linking it to multiple rooms. the clarity is above my expectations i would definitely recommend it to friends
12489,8,love it!
12490,0,the features are what i like the most and least. not being able easy compatibility with smart tv is not finding the correct information makes it the least.
12491,9,"as the others i have this one works great, i love it!"
12492,12,"it was a gift, we are still learning how to use it. we have enjoyed it so far and alexa makes us laugh, is helpful with homework,  and cooking."
12493,9,the quality of speaker was a pleasant surprise. i have really enjoyed using the echo.
12494,11,impressive device!!!
12495,10,i love being able to listen to music of my choice.
12496,0,love it but do not like how music etc you have to pay extra.
12497,1,great range of quality sound.
12498,14,i already own an alex dot which has a charging cradle this one requires it to be plugged in all the time which i was not expecting.
12499,0,"the sound is good, but the music is limited unless you pay extra every month.  we have also been disappointed by the number of questions she can not answer."
12500,14,it has a nice sound when playing music. also turns lights on and off if connected to a wi fi outlet. i did not know what to expect but we are happy with it
12501,8,love it
12502,8,love it
12503,14,mine does not maintain it is wifi link.  as a result i have to reset it on a very regular basis.  the sound is great.
12504,1,great overall sound.  useful multi room music
12505,12,great speaker  still learning to get the most of it
12506,0,"the knowledge base is very limited. i was expecting this product to aid in the speaking of spanish, but it only speaks english."
12507,0,it is so loud and it is wonderful. definitely more bass than i expected. sometimes she does not hear too well but i¡¯m still very much satisfied.
12508,0,"does know half the questions i ask it. not a very broad knowledge base. get a lot of ""sorry i do not know that answer"""
12509,8,alexa is great!
12510,0,not a single negative word. love it!
12511,4,easy setup- sound is good.  it works as advertised.
12512,14,love its voice recognition. was not happy to learn it requires spotify premium.had difficulty pairing macbook to echo?
12513,14,fyi-alexa cannot make a connection through a laptop that has a firewall such as mine(windows 10). i used a smart phone to make the connection.
12514,11,love the new smaller more chic design with amazing sound!!!
12515,10,"terrific. alexa makes everything easier. she wakes me up, tells me how to dress and guides my day."
12516,14,it has met my expectations of what i was looking for. disappointed it will not bluetooth with my ipod. also the it can not access my iphone calendar.
12517,10,love alexa! from music to jokes to playing jeopardy it is great!!
12518,0,awesome speaker! i can not say enough good things about the echo.
12519,0,alexa answers general questions but not enough of my questions.
12520,11,"replaced with newer model, still has so much bass that it is difficult to understand!"
12521,11,"same great quality and sound of the original echo, though i do miss being able to manually turn the top ring to adjust volume."
12522,14,"annoying at times, fear of things being ordered accidentally. it responsonds to television adds. verdict still out at our home"
12523,11,"sounds great just not very much bass to the music. i do not really want a lot, just the same as the original echo!"
12524,8,"loved it, alexa is great!"
12525,4,set up was very difficult
12526,9,"throughly enjoy my christmas gift of the echo. did not know what i was missing. i walk into my house, speak to alexa and boom music fills the air."
12527,11,"i love it, the sound is much better"

12533,0,so far .... we love it!  sound is great!  but u need to download the app and purchase amazon music for optimal use
12534,1,love alexa. very handy.
12535,14,"terrible experience, difficult to set up, does not work in public wifi nets (like hotels), the sound is not so good as other alternative devices, etc"
12536,4,great source of entertainment.
12537,10,"we are enjoying the music, answers to quick questions, weather reports."
12538,9,super product- easily paired with my smart phone. sound quality is awesome!
12539,5,received this for christmas... love it...
12540,10,my husband and i love it. we use it every day. we have it in our bedroom. we use it to wake up in the morning and use it to relax to go to sleep.
12541,7,"love it, it makes my life easy...<f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+008d>"
12542,10,love the echo. great for music and it learns what you like. my daughter asks for jokes all the time. great purchase.
12543,14,audio clarity and volume. no dislikes at this time.
12544,10,super easy to set up. not too crazy about having to add apps to get more music. happy with it over all.
12545,14,should have waited for the sales
12546,0,"it is stupid. most of things i like ( for instant, classic music,  french shansonie) it does not understand. nor ferenz list , neither joe dassin"
12547,8,love it
12548,0,love this thing my only thing is the set up of it was harder to do - seems easy but it is not. i¡¯m pretty techie person and this was no simple thing to do
12549,5,"it is a great device, the family loves it!"
12550,1,great!
12551,0,"when you ask it for certain artist or songs it can not do the task, yet when i go to the app on my laptop i can get  it to play anything i want."
12552,1,very happy with this. sound is great!
12553,1,we love our echo. we have a lot of fun with it too
12554,11,"the new echo is smaller, better looking and sounds better then the previous generation.  it is an evolution not revolution of the echo but a solid one worth upgrading for."
12555,11,very easy to work with the voice control touch screen  on  the pjonecwjth app for house lights works well ... sound is great
12556,10,"i am 88 years old.  i love alexa.  when i do not have a lot to do, i ask her to send me music.  talk to her a little each day."
12557,4,very helpful and fun to use!
12558,10,the response to a wide variety of reauests.more guidance on structuring requests.
12559,14,really need to add more skills. right now the alexa can not do much more than play music and order toilet paper.
12560,14,we have two love the way they work together!! love dropping in room to room and sharing music and playing games
12561,11,much better sound and response.
12562,9,son was so happy he left christmas lunch early to go home and set it up.
12563,2,i love this echo.  the sound is fantastic!
12564,14,best value for the buck that i have experience in a long time! great sound.i use it for the kitchen because of the timer and my choice of music.
12565,4,easy to set up. great sound and reach.
12566,14,enjoying echo and giving amazon music service a trial run.
12567,11,looks better and cheaper price than 1st gen. it sounds the same as the previous model. great buy.
12568,14,"sent as a gift and one of the best gifts i have received in a long time. took a while to load the echo app and get it started but when i did, works perfectly."
12569,11,"like the sound, a big step up from our echo dot."
12570,0,good sound.it can not always find a song if you do not know the correct name & artist. i am still learning to work with it.
12571,11,"sound is great, alexa works great, everything is works as advertised. the wood finish looks amazing. can not beat the quality at this price! thanks amazon!"
12572,14,best device out there. has made a lot of aspects of my life easier. would buy more.
12573,4,great product... versatile... easy to set up ... fun .... ( and i¡¯m 76 )sound quality better than i expected for this kind of device
12574,10,"i enjoy this so much.  after a long busy night at work, i come home and say alexa playing soothing music. i am very happy with this product"
12575,5,"love my echo, very happy"
12576,0,only thing that is not great is that you can not link your itunes account and the fact that she can not really look up much unless she is programmed to do so.
12577,5,it was a christmas gift. they love it.
12578,3,the echo is everything i thought it would be!!
12579,10,"excellent speakers, so l can listen my music, check weather, setup alarm, setup timer, to do spell check and many more!"
12580,3,works great!  arrived on time.
12581,8,love it
12582,0,the thing i like the most is her interaction and  personality and the least thing is  the app is hard to maneuver
12583,10,great
12584,10,really enjoy this! looking forward to getting the light bulbs so i can tell alexa to turn the lights on and off.
12585,4,problem get it hook up
12586,1,we love alexia. love the music. love the simplicity. love the service.
12587,11,fast shipment.  upgrade from my echo dot.  works and sounds excellent.
12588,8,love it
12589,14,received as a gift. would be disappointed if purchased on my own.
12590,1,excellent. sound quality not the best but works well
12591,0,it is a very interesting device that you are able to use at your leisure. i like the fact that i can mute it if necessary. very good device
12592,11,"first generation echo has better sound. this one looks nice, blends better into the room,but unfortunately the sound is not as full as the earlier alexa"
12593,14,"my echo did not work at hilton hotel, but the games are fun to play at home on the echo. that is why i gave 4 stars."
12594,5,it was a gift and he absolutely loved it!! thanks
12595,1,the echo is a very nice addition to our home.
12596,14,very good sound. this is my 4th device installed in the house. with the all speakers group there is music all over the house.
12597,8,love this..
12598,1,it is great!
12599,9,we love this unit.  we bought one for each of our grown kids for christmas and even the small grandkids are loving it!  great sound and very easy to set up!
12600,0,love the variations of music and the sound. one thing i do not like is i have to turn it on each time it stops playing.is it something i did initially?
12601,11,excellent sound quality. alexa could be improved however.
12602,7,love it<u+2764><u+fe0f><u+2764><u+fe0f><u+2764><u+fe0f> speaker is loud and is a great alarm clock.  my kids love asking it question and even helps them with spelling and tells them jokes
12603,14,i like the reminder and the lists. sound for music is very good.i wish i could adjust the treble for alexa is voice it sounds a little muffled to me.
12604,1,amazing sound!
12605,0,loud :) a little hard to setup would be my only complaint
12606,9,outstanding. everybody should have one. how about educators developing curriculum that uses echo. that would be an awesome teaching tool.
12607,14,"i was not a fan. i bought it because it said it was bluetooth, but i could not get it to connect to my iphone. the instructions were not helping either."
12608,10,we had one already at home that is why i bought another the grandchildren seem to love asking a question how i download music it is a big convenience i really like it
12609,14,i love it
12610,12,"love my new device , love amazon music , still exploring all the capabilities of this device"
12611,11,"this is my first echo so i do not have anything to compare it to, but really like it.  sound quality is very good."
12612,10,"wakes me up, tells me jokes, gives me sports scores, changes the channel and plays my favorite music."
12613,14,it played music but now it can not seem to find any artist online.  i am about to return it for a refund or replacement.
12614,11,this works great it helps out aroind the house so much puls the sound is amazing it looks beautiful i have the grayish one for now
12615,9,i love the sound of my echo gen2. have not challenged it that much yet but so far i am loving it. it was a christmas gift from my daughter.
12616,0,she does what i want. sometimes she stay in one stationbut most of the time is really helpful. i like it
12617,10,we like that you can ask alexia to play any song or radio station and it plays right away. great speaker too!
12618,8,we love alexa !!
12619,14,talking to it
12620,1,perfect
12621,1,great
12622,10,"i love my alexa. its great and you will never get bored.. everyone should have one, and the sound is amazing that this little thing puts out..."
12623,14,it work very well and even i had no issues setting it up.
12624,9,i love my echo! so happy that i finally made the purchase
12625,10,it could not find any gregorian chant music.
12626,11,"this was a gift, easy to activate and use. sound is nominal, but enjoyable.. i would buy this.."
12627,0,i really like the design but it seems to static a lot i do not know if my speaker is blown or what but i¡¯m not happy about it
12628,12,"have only tapped into a small portion of what alexa has to offer, but i love it already.  looking forward to exploring more!"
12629,10,wow! did not realize what this was really capable of doing. this is really great at responding to inquires and telling jokes!
12630,11,"i feel the original echo was loader and sounded better. the echo dot is worse the the 2nd generation echo. my recommendation would be to buy a used echo,"
12631,1,the feature i enjoy the most is the efficiency that echo provides in assessing my music and controlling my appliances.  it is an awesome device!
12632,0,"i love it.  it meets all of my expectations except sometimes the device does not pick up voice activate easily.  other than that, great product."
12633,1,it has a very quick response when you ask it a question. good sound quality with a nice base sound.
12634,0,not very good with answers!!!
12635,14,"overall i am happy with this purchase.  this is not our first echo and i was very concerned with a lot of the reviews indicating the sound quality on the 2nd generation was bad.  when i got this echo set up and started playing music, the reviews were correct about the sound.  however, about the 3rd song in, the echo announced it received an important update and needed to restart.  after the restart completed it was a night and day difference in sound quality and was much better.  the reason i gave this 4 stars is because when i listen to the same song side by side on 1st and 2nd generation, the bass in the 1st generation echo still sounds better.  i am not saying the 2nd generation sounds bad, but amazon advertises this as having improved sound and i do not agree.  i really like some of the features the echo has if you own multiple echo is such as playing music on all your connected echo is and the drop in feature.  i would still recommend this product and not be concerned about the sound."
12636,14,"love the responsiveness and when i do not have a service i need, alexa makes the recommendation."
12637,9,my daughter loved it.  she uses it to play music. works for the whole family.  excellent sound.
12638,1,the sound is awesome.
12639,9,i am 91 so just really use it for music and it is very good for that.
12640,11,met expectations with a louder volume than the dot. the heather gray exterior make it very fashionable in our living room.
12641,7,"i love this thing. plays my music,  tells me joke, turns on my tv...what is not to like. gave one to the kids, they love it too!<f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+008e>"
12642,9,purchased for mother as a christmas gift. love the fact she has the chance to have music played for her while she cleans or sews
12643,14,the sound quality is so much better than the dot/ but sometimes it shuts down without any reason.
12644,10,love it! helps me keep track of our family is busy schedules as well as staying organized. we also have a dot and love the drop in feature.
12645,9,"so sorry it took us so long to get the echo.  we love it!  i got it as a gift for my husband, but i work from home and use it all the time."
12646,4,fun to use
12647,0,"i¡¯m using google assistant. and she is very good in term of responding to you even if she does not understand you, she would respond to you and tell you."
12648,14,"the sound rivals a bose mini.  the mini does sound a little better, but the echo connects effortlessly to the bose anyway via bluetooth."
12649,1,fully satisfied with the clarity in sound. i love music coming out of it
12650,14,everything is awesome. the only thing it freaks me out when it automatically starts talking or activates itself from sleep mode.
12651,9,"i really love my new echo ,so much my oldest bought one."
12652,9,love my alexa with 3.99 a month for all the music i want

12654,14,"i had difficulty getting it going, but with the help of a very nice tech. person, we did get it to go and i am happy now."
12655,11,"4/5, it is voice recognition feature its more faulty than the echo dot i have in the bathroom."
12656,10,she is very informative and tells very good stories.  great for trivia questions and games.
12657,3,product was delivered on time and sounds awesome. could not be any happier with my purchase.
12658,11,the microphone is not as sensitive as my echo dot.
12659,10,love listening my music and getting the weather!

12746,14,the performance and quality of the product is precisely what i researched and read reviews on. i am quite satisfied with amazon services

12779,8,love it!!!!!
12780,9,"we truly love it, the sound is wonderful for a device as large as a glass. i am thinking of getting a smaller one for the bedroom....."
12781,1,great sound.
12782,10,we really like it. use it all the time mostly play music. enjoy the games also.

12798,1,"luv this, it is really nice and accommodating."
12799,11,the music sound is 10x better than my iphone.
12800,14,i was hoping for the best but what a let down. i have a google home but i do allot of shopping on amazon so i wanted to get this when i got it it was heavy so i was like this thing should sound great but as soon as i hooked it up and played it i was so shocked it sounded like two tin cans i played the same songs on my google home. and on the echo and the echo had no bass at all while the google home filled the room with good bass and treble so disappointed i know people say what do you expect for $100.00 well i got my google home for $89.00 so i expected better i am not expecting bose but i am expecting better sound than this especially since amazon said the sound was so good..i have seen reports that their is a update to make the sound better i have not received it as yet but if it does not improve this is going right back to amazon.
12801,11,improvement over the first generation
12802,12,still have a lot to learn but am enjoying the music feature a lot.
12803,10,nice modern design. extremely easy to setup and use. my daughter enjoys asking alexa questions. think it will be a great learning tool.
12804,14,"the sound quality was actually better than anticipated, so i no longer need my bluetooth speaker to play music in the rooms with echos."
12805,14,i liked the ease of use. i do not like that now i have to buy all the sockets and switches so i can be a couch potato and turn everything on and off..lol
12806,1,"lots of great features.  alexa gets a thrown by background sounds (like the television) on occasion, but overall, the echo is a great smart speaker."
12807,14,i am concerned about recording what we say but the echo works very well and is fun to have in the house. looking forward to.making it a smart house.
12808,0,"music is the same selection over and over, does not know the weather in my area the few questions i have asked does not know the answer waste of money"
12809,4,the sound is great and it was easy to set up.
12810,0,"speaks too fast. sometimes difficult to understand if one is slightly hearing impaired. otherwise, a wonderful wonderful  instrument!"
12811,12,it is unbelievable how ¡°smart¡± alexa is..
12812,1,great!
12813,14,"i just buy it and i can not use it just because i live in mexico ? i can not download the app ! why? i got my us address, and you sold me the device"
12814,10,"this works about as well as expected... i am impressed. makes music in the home a snap, saves time over the other devices for similar.rkb"
12815,14,big piece of trash. does not have mix tapes. wtf is it good for then????i¡¯m glad i did not spend my money on this device.
12816,2,amazing product. love her
12817,14,great sound. crank up some john 5 everyone!

12820,1,the sound is awesome!!!
12821,14,i love this product and for $4 per month of unlimited music only to the echo it is a fantastic value!
12822,10,i have control of most of my house lighting without having to leave my chair. next i will be installing house security.
12823,3,did not think i would like it as much as i do.
12824,14,"love it.  sound is clear and fills a huge, 26-foot ceiling family room and kitchen area (over 1500 sq ft)."
12825,14,easily connects tibiphone via bluetooth and sound is just right for my kitchen

12835,0,"not really impressed. about the only thing ""she"" is capable of doing is greeting me, giving me a useless fact, and playing some songs."
12836,14,it is good but do not seem able to connect and use contacts list for making calls even though connected to the app on my iphone with bluetooth.
12837,12,fun to play with.  just scratching the surface of what we can do with it.
12838,0,it was easy to set up. her reaction is very slow at first but she does speed up within 10 minutes of asking her random questions.
12839,0,it is very fun to talk to she answers a lot of questions. she will play any kind of music if she can find it. love to hear the christmas songs
12840,0,"this item is very cool. the only thing is some things it should be able to answer according to online, she says. i am not sure about that. ."

12843,1,love it.  sounds great and is fun

12845,10,"i love that i can play music from any genre, depending on my mood and my guests. it is a little difficult to set up, but worth the time! love it!"
12846,12,i have not used all her features yet but i am very pleased so far.
12847,10,we have enjoyed it daily.  glad suggestions are sent daily or i would run out of questions.  we use ours mainly for music.
12848,10,enjoying the ease of listening to music.

12985,0,"it sounds good it just randomly starts to respond without its name, it doesnt work with my cast devises and it doesntl like to do alot of htings"
12986,14,took a little bit for it to connect to my wifi but as soon as it did it was perfect. the sound is amazing
12987,0,the sound is wonderful but when i ask a questions sometimes the echo does not know the answer but my cell phone does
12988,9,love being able to use it as an intercom with the one in my husband is shop!

13006,0,i like that you can ask alexa questions.  i do not like that how difficult it is to connect via bluetooth to other speakers and systems.
13007,14,item was stolen from my front door. this never fails. i wish you would have a better set time to deliver items.
13008,14,the amazing  range of available music; i was disappointed that i could not access the second movement of mozart jupiter symphony.
13009,0,so far it is okay. it will not sync my music from my iphone for some reason which is annoying but i¡¯m sure it¡¯ll still be a good purchase
13010,1,excellent product!!
13011,14,i can change requests to alexa from across the room.  unlike my smaller version of echo.
13012,14,"bought as a gift but it came with my account on it, and it would not let me put a different account on it so i had to return it."
13013,11,the quality of the sounds compares to bose speakers which i also have. even with the volume up the sounds are crisp and clear no distortion
13014,0,i like to play music on it
13015,14,thought i could use it as a speakerphone but that is not the case. otherwise its great.
13016,0,"it would be much better if alexa could easily recognize non-english songs as well. anyhow, i like everything about it so far."
13017,10,"alexa knows everything from keeping me informed of the news, weather, etc to make my day brighter. great product!"
13018,14,love the echo and alexa is like part of the family. i love linking the echo to pandora and listening to a mix of the same genre of music.

13022,14,the sound is great!  a couple times it lost signal.  not sure if that is are internet provider is fault or echo?
13023,0,it is everything that i wanted
13024,2,we like our echo.
13025,11,great sound and responsive at greater distance.  would recommend.
13026,0,i like how she responds to questions.i do not like it when she is getting more info and does not want to be disturbed. sounds alien.

13028,0,very sensitive to language instructions. good sound when playing.

13035,0,it never knows the answer to my question. it is always telling me it does not have that information. frustrating to the point that i just google.
13036,14,the sound quality it is nice and very loud. work is good in alexa mode and bluetooth. it is very good to use with philips hue and work is properly.
13037,0,"i do not like this product. the app is not user friendly. i can not program alexa to do anything, so i have this sitting on a table doing nothing."
13038,9,"great sound, works great with the other echo we have at home."
13039,1,great product with lots of amazing features!
13040,14,great for stereo effect with pandora
13041,14,i thought it would be able to much more out of the box . it is probably an awesome device i¡¯m just too low tech for it .
13042,12,"this device thinks that i am in palmerton,  pa. and nothing i do can convince it otherwise!?"
13043,1,great item. works and has fabulous sound. i am very pleased with this item!

13046,14,works great and easy to hookup. i got 3 of them.
13047,9,this device is amazing!!!! my whole family uses it and we are not absolutely sure why we did not have one sooner..
13048,14,great when it works. needs to be rebooted at least once a day. touch buttons on top respond if and when they want.
13049,14,this is the best accessory for your home...it goes refrigerator then echo!  better then a dish washer!
13050,14,i finally have a true friend!
13051,10,sound is just as good as bose.  love being able to request my favorite artist  also great for quick information.  best purchase we made all year!!
13052,9,"i just love it. i bought three, have them all over the house. still experimenting and finding new things. wish i had one in the car."
13053,10,its like having a second wife. i love this thing so much!
13054,4,very vague instructions about initial set up and linking devices.
13055,12,so far so good! it is very fun and she is very helpful with things.
13056,14,i love this! sound is excellent. the only issue i have is when i set an alarm it needs to be loud no matter what the volume is set at.
13057,9,i gave it as a christmas gift and had the pleasures of listening to the music. just incredible sound. my friend was very happy with the gift.
13058,10,i like the classical music genre and that i can ask for songs as i choose.i enjoy the ability to ask questions and get answers.
13059,10,i love having my own music and news any time i i ask for it.
13060,0,its like having someone in the house with you.  what i like least is it cuts off from time to time. sometimes i need to restart.
13061,1,great sound quality and alexa is highly responsive.
13062,1,the speakers on this echo are good quality and music sounds really good for the size. i think this is a good value!
13063,14,"our echo has lost the audio a couple of times but after speaking with a tech, they walked us through a reset."
13064,9,amazing! my grandchildren liked it so much. they enjoyed listening to alexa. thank you and more power!
13065,0,that i can ask anything and get an instant answer.
13066,10,"i am really enjoying my new echo.  it is plays music, answers me when i say good morning and give me a trivia for the day.  love it."
13067,8,i love it!
13068,1,sound quality is amazing
13069,10,i love the new echo. it is convenient and sounds great playing music etc.
13070,2,i love my alexa.
13071,0,loving alexa. she listens better than siri! or my children!!
13072,11,had the previous generation paired with a sound box improve fidelity. new device has crystal clear sound by itself!
13073,5,"it was a christmas gift for another and appreciated it, and uses it."
13074,9,"this is our 3rd echo, we love them, great to have for listening to music and much more ... the payment plan is also an added bonus."
13075,0,"unless i buy amazon prime, there is not much use for it except radio stations and weather. it is a way for you to sell stuff!!!"
13076,14,unplugged after a week. would blurt out nonsense periodically with prompting. horses. ice cream. etc. worthless waste of money
13077,14,"the new echo has vastly better sound quality, as well as much more aesthetically pleasing to the eye in a main room such as a living room or family room.  functionality is pretty much the same however, which was always pretty good from my experience with previous echo devices, however the new echo might be more accurate at hearing requests.  i¡¯ve noticed the new echo does not randomly activate (previously would happen with older echo is i guess if it sounded like some one said alexa). however i¡¯m not sure if that is just coincidence or if the new echo has been tweaked a bit.  all and all i would say if you have an existing echo dot or tap and you¡¯re satisfied with the sound and quality then you really do not need to upgrade, i did because i was looking for superior sound quality, and accessory speaker attachment so i previously bought for it made it bulky or did not perform well.  this has simplified things a bit for me and gave me the sound i was not looking for with music."
13078,0,i do like alexa however she still needs a lot of updates to answer  some current questions.
13079,14,"she is a good friend, she is always there for me. she will never leave you. alexa is the girlfriend of the year. not a good cook tho."
13080,2,we love alexa!
13081,14,it is great! i recommend it to all of my friends! could be louder and does have a hard hearing my voice from just a few feet away.
13082,11,i like the chunky woven type appearance. aslso the sound is full and has good bass.i miss the twist top volume from echo 1.
13083,1,great quality sound. love it
13084,8,love it!!!
13085,9,i love it and she is very funny ....
13086,14,awesome!!!!!! thats all i got to say
13087,14,keeps starting and stopping with music both the echo and dot.  starts failing around 8pm for about 3 hours.  it not our internet be cause we g
13088,10,"we have fun requesting music, asking the weather for the day, getting news updates, sporting scores. it is been enjoyable. sound is incredible!"
13089,0,lots of cool features but do not like that anyone talking can interrupt by saying any word close to alexa.
13090,1,great device. really fun and practical.
13091,0,the sound is good. i have tried three times to get alexa to respond only to my voice but it not working. i would like to get news more local.
13092,10,this has a great sound.  so far it works well with my voice.  easy set up with pandora on my ipad.
13093,14,god
13094,8,it is great.
13095,10,very cool and love music unlimited!
13096,1,very nice and well worth the money.
13097,5,i watched a video on this speaker and bought it for my sister who absolutely loves it!
13098,10,fun and informative. good addition to enliven parties and help entertain.
13099,9,love all my echos and dots:)
13100,11,it is worse it sucks my original echo with better sound and better overall quality got replaced with this one horrible
13101,1,awesome purchase!
13102,14,"this is an amazing product. music without commercials, unlike pandora . with prime you get so much."
13103,11,love it . i liked it better when you could turn the dial down orup on the top for volume
13104,14,a little gitchy with the app interface. can not use all the features.  basically a good speaker
13105,11,improved sound quality.
13106,4,easy to set up love it!
13107,3,"as advertised, sounds awesome, shipped quickly."
13108,14,awesome! went above and beyond my expectations.
13109,10,purchased for me by my daughter trying to update my life... really glad she did! i am enjoying it immensely.
13110,4,great sound and easy to use.
13111,5,love it
13112,9,it was a gift from our kids and it has ben an enjoyable experience. so easy to setup and use. should have gotten one sooner. highly recommended
13113,14,the sound was advertised as being improved over echo (1st gen).music sounds awful! not what was advertised. are you going to fix it?
13114,9,i love it.  plus i could not believe how loud this small thing can be.  i love calling people from it
13115,10,i love that i can just command out loud to put alarms for me to awake up and now what is the weather without the need to use my phone
13116,11,sound is much better and i like the size and color.

13121,0,i like the interaction between me and the machine.  i have not had it long so i am still learning to activate certain commands.

13124,1,fun and useful!
13125,10,she is just like a member of the family!
13126,0,does cool things but the speak quality is not good enough for the money
13127,11,this sounds as good as the larger echo!!! love it
13128,0,half the time it does not have an answer the other half it just stops working.
13129,0,i like everything about alexa she does music she does my lights she is great to have it
13130,4,our echo was super simple to set up. it arrived nicely packaged.
13131,10,love the clear sound and the ability to request all genres of music!
13132,14,"alexa was challenging to install, but it is been delightful to get the weather 24/7."
13133,8,awesome!
13134,0,works very well. does basics and i included amazon music which is nice.
13135,9,my mom could not have been happier receiving this on christmas morning! thank you!
13136,0,good speaker but have to reboot a lot....stop playing music and says it is playing but is not.....will not work again till i unplug and plug back in
13137,12,"i love it ,and still learning how to use itit makes me happy and enjoy using it"
13138,14,can not get it to control my tv properly. tried anymote and smart remote. only some functions will work. and sometimes those do not work either.
13139,0,"i like the ease of learning the system, my least favorite is that she is picking the eagles to win the superbowl... so far i am very impressed"
13140,3,works as advertised. no complaints.
13141,0,"access to my music library , speaker is very good, ability to answer questions is ok so far. so nuances alexa is not familiar with."
13142,10,very user friendly. i love that you can add items to a grocery list when at home and then pull up the list on the app at the store.
13143,1,very helpful and useful. would recommend to anyone.
13144,1,having too much fun with this!
13145,14,"i have 8 of these, set up in 2 groups. 2 of the 8 are dot is that use for my subs.  love the sound and how much i can do with them."
13146,10,i enjoy the great variety of music that is available.  a fun thing to say good morning and good night.
13147,0,works better than i expected asked it many different questions
13148,11,amazing device. looking to buy the dot also.
13149,10,i love the music and timer.
13150,9,"the sound is outstanding - full, and clear with every lyric crystal clear.  exactly what i wanted."
13151,14,sound is excellent. i have had problems linking the echo to my cell phone for commands and other functions thru the internet.
13152,8,great product. use it extensively every day!
13153,14,"very hard to set up, grown son even had trouble setting it up (he had no trouble with his, just ours). it will only recognize one voice."
13154,1,the sound that comes out is amazing.  very clear and easy to use.
13155,5,works very good. it was purchased as a christmas present and our grand daughter loves it.
13156,14,great product only downfall for me is you have to tell it what streaming service to use for music.
13157,12,was not sure i was going to like this but i love it. the more i explore the app the more fun i find.
13158,9,"was a gift,  it is fun. when playing music, speaker sounds great. enjoy it so much. i bought an echo dot for another room."
13159,14,works really well. i installed several tp-link switches. echo turns them on at my command or from my phone. music also sounds great.
13160,11,exho 1st gen sounds better than this one
13161,10,"i love my echo, she keeps me up to date. the speaker sounds great and i can utilize her with my wireless speakers."
13162,14,installment is not easy for non-us users.
13163,9,we are still figuring it out! we gave it to my mom for an early mother is day gift and she is having fun with alexa!
13164,0,i found out i enjoy finding out things about what happened on that day from the past and other people things special things about the day
13165,10,"love it!!! received this for my birthday and it is been a blast. not so fond of what my kids add to my shopping list, but even that can be funny."
13166,14,i like being able to access audible.  sometimes it has problems setting up an alarm.  it understands 5 a.m. but not 5:30 a.m. for some reason.
13167,14,"works great during off peak time.  really struggles "" understanding "" with hughsnet internet service when school is out.."
13168,14,"i wish alexa would be more interactive, and would remember my name, my spouse is name, etc. other than that, it is a great device!"
13169,5,"my son in law is having so much fun with this, ideal for birthday gift."
13170,3,met all of our expectations. it works just as great would buy it again.
13171,9,our daughter loved her christmas present. we are all in love with alexa.
13172,0,enjoy talking to alexa she is so understanding
13173,0,so far i enjoy everything about it. especially playing local radio. have not used to the fullest of its ability with being busy. overall enjoy it
13174,14,"i like the sound quality, the instant recognition of your voice, and ease of set up. i was shocked to learn that it was corded, meaning has to be plugged to an electric outlet all the time. i gifted an amazon ""tap"" to my daughter and one of the great things about it is that you can take it to the patio and play it without a cord, because it is battery operated. you have to pick it up or touch the button to give it instructions, which i thought would be good for her with small children. so i think in many ways the ""tap"" might be a better choice for some people."
13175,14,perfection
13176,0,"i like talking to alexa.what i like least is, i had trouble installing alexa.  it took my son 3 tries also to get alexa installed"
13177,9,this was one of those christmas presents that i did not know i always needed.
13178,14,did not work consistently.  am familiar with echo and something was not right about response and sound quality.  ordered new one.
13179,14,me myself i like the sound quality from a small tube that is. my dislike is i was under the impression it knew more than it do.
13180,10,we are having a lot of fun with it!  we only use it to play music and ask it silly questions but that works for  us!
13181,0,"it responds correctly for the most part to all questions and demands, it sometimes  is a little slow but our internet is slower than normal."
13182,10,"great sound, easy to use and setup. enjoy the product very much. grandkids also have a blast using it and asking alexia to play their songs."
13183,0,"just didnt expect to get so many ""i do not know that answer"" from the alexa. i ask a lot of history questions. i am very disappointed."
13184,1,sounds awesome!
13185,2,love it!
13186,10,liked it playing music.  answering questions. weather reports different cities
13187,11,"excellent sound and nice range, however not sure it is that much of an improvement over the original."
13188,0,"still learning, but i like it!!!! love listening to books."
13189,11,this thing has great sound quality and surprising low end.
13190,8,love it
13191,14,hard to program for a novice!
13192,10,"at first, i thought, no this is not for me....i received it as a gift.  i absolutely love it.  does so many things!!!!"
13193,8,love it :)
13194,8,love it!!!
13195,3,we like it
13196,14,it controls all that it said it would including our nest and tv. it has an impressive speaker with good volume. very happy with alexa.
13197,14,"the sound is definitely not improved over the first generation echo.  the promise of improved sound was the reason i ""upgraded"".  also, if you order the ""white"" sandstone color you get a black power adapter and cord.  the first generation echo shipped with a matching white power adapter and cord.  this new model appears to be a cost optimized echo and not ""better"" many (any?) way."
13198,0,it is fun and useful for small pieces of info you might need on the run. sound is amazing!
13199,12,we are constantly discovering different commands. love it!having a hard time with husbands commands to alexa.
13200,0,good sound quality. intelligent. could be improved more. lots of ¡° i do not know¡± answers but i¡¯m sure this will continue to improve!
13201,1,great sound
13202,8,love alexa!
13203,14,great gadget to ask questions of. but her voice is muffled and hard to understand unless stand by it.
13204,14,"sound quality great.  easy set upleast: if you lose wifi connection, reset up can be difficult."
13205,0,really like the way i can ask for weather and time and the way it plays music still can not figure out how to download my songs
13206,14,sound has greatly improved along with clarity of alexia is voice. alexia is easier to understand than any other product on market.
13207,0,the music and the sound are great. you have to speak to alexa with the correct words. that takes time to learn
13208,10,"i love all the wonderful music, and that she can call my friends for me on my cell phone. thumbs up for alexa!"
13209,10,"i like that music is always at my command.  alexa can also answer questions, tell jokes and lull you to sleep with soothing sounds."
13210,9,really was suprised when i recieved this for christmas. it was fun setting it up. i am still leaning how to get the most out of it.
13211,10,"love it i have it in my kitchen i play music on it, jeopardy have her update me on current events and she even compliments me"
13212,10,mostly been using for prime music and we are very impressed with the sound this little thing puts out. would definitely recommend!
13213,1,love my echo. just fun. looks good. sound is good.
13214,14,sound good works well but drop off line for no reason give message it is unavailable.
13215,0,a little trouble getting online but we are enjoying now!
13216,14,in all honesty i bought this because of the awesome ¡°sound¡± reviews. ¡°gen 2 improved sound¡±...... ugh i never owned a gen 1 so i will not attempt to compare. what i will say is the speaker in this thing is absolute garbage. do not fool yourself into thinking you can listen to music on this thing. it is completely weak with zero bass....the things that alexa can do are pretty cool overall just terrible sound. the power cord has a giant transformer on it which is unsightly. amazon has a lot of work to do. my parents google pill has better sound.
13217,11,"this is my 2nd alexa, i like that it is smaller...voice recognition seems improved."
13218,0,i bought the echo out of curiosity.  i like it but do not know enough to rate it.  i probably have not used all of its capabilities.
13219,10,love my alexa!
13220,11,i like it more than an echo dot it is more louder to then the echo dot.
13221,9,it is just what i needed in my new place . did not want to hook up all the wires and stereo surround.  thank you . awesome gift to myself
13222,4,"unit works nice, once you get it set up (instructions are very vague). other than that very pleased."
13223,1,great sound quality from this little speaker.
13224,1,terrific device with very good sound quality.
13225,8,love it
13226,5,my son and his family love it
13227,9,loving the quality of sound! fills our entire basement and it is not even turned up that high. thinking of getting another for upstairs!
13228,10,love the music it brings into our home. very easy to use.
13229,3,as advertised
13230,10,still needs to learn more commands and more information based on questions i ask. but for the most part this thing is pretty awesome!!
13231,10,it is useful in many ways. i wish it was more helpful in providing general info. thought it was more like the actual internet.
13232,14,"wish the speaker had more ""thump"" to it...the functions work just fine, its just not in the same ballpark as other speakers i have."
13233,0,great technology! alexa is fun and convenient. the only thing i would change is better options for music commands through pandora and such.
13234,14,device is not nearly intuitive enough nor does it offer enough function to handle intimate details of a persons life and routine. gimmickey
13235,9,"so far so good, i am not techy smart, but love my echo so far. it was chosen as a christmas present for someone, decided to keep it myself."
13236,2,i love my echo!
13237,5,great gift for christmas!
13238,9,"the cover is great... and i love my alexa, the best invention, 'till now!"
13239,11,has good bass but no crisp treble
13240,12,still learning all that it can do and still need to add my smart plugs but loving everything so far!
13241,4,effective and fun to use. works well
13242,1,echo alexa is a fun tool.
13243,0,alexa has a little learning to do .  can not expect her to know everything. great fun playing jeopardy! like the look of the echo
13244,0,just got it but having trouble setting the alarm feature.
13245,9,shipped so fast. i have purchased 4 we love this product.
13246,3,does everything that we expected
13247,11,speaker has too much bass
13248,14,great sound and alexa is very good at hearing you and doing what you ask with accuracy
13249,0,works great! only thing is i can not seem to get my music from itunes library.  other than that for the price it is pretty cool
13250,14,voice recognition needs improvement.  also several requests could not be answered so better use of the web would be helpful.
13251,10,clear sound.  enjoy listening to music on it.
13252,8,i love it!
13253,12,"we love how easy it is to use, and how useful it is. it takes up very little space and sounds great."
13254,14,sounds great and can hear over server fans!
13255,1,quick response with a broad range of topics.
13256,8,my grandkids love it
13257,0,"music cuts out, start my day feature works when it wants to, alexa seems to barely understand basic commands. not worth the money."
13258,10,"very happy with my alexa purchase. both very entertaining and informative. good source of information-music, weather, history etc."
13259,1,nice
13260,1,"while this product is a genius, it is variations of volume while playing music is not acceptable."
13261,1,great device rotten sound
13262,7,my wife love it for christmas she thought it was great.  a christmas present . i bought her ..  thanks amazon.<f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0087>
13263,9,i bought it for my disabled son. he loves to sing with it.
13264,8,i love it!
13265,13,greatest invention since night baseball and canned beer.
13266,1,love the sound quality!
13267,5,use it in my surgical technology lab at a college. the students love it.
13268,3,no problems.  it is what i expected.
13269,0,works great. figured out skills real easily. wish it had more languages to program.
13270,10,love the information i receive when asking questions. very informative and helpful.
13271,0,it worked well for 1 day.  now alexia does not answer and if she does she says to try the next day as she can not understand what i am saying
13272,9,alexa knows so much stuff!  we have a ball with her!  all ages love it!
13273,14,outstanding devices and unlimited usage. no complaints at all very proud to have invested in echo and alexa technology.
13274,9,"perfect for my office. good sound, small footprint."
13275,11,really good sound.  even better price.
13276,10,i love to use it to listen to music and get sports scores!
13277,14,"after using the echo dot for over a year, and truly loving its functionality, i thought i¡¯d order the full sized echo. i was after a more full bodied speaker sound for playing musical selections.i had a tough time getting it to connect to wifi. i¡¯ve also noticed the volume does not go up nearly as loud and the sound is very muffled. ives used it as an alarm clock and the sound just is not loud enough.  after reading similar reviews, it seems this second generation echo falls short on functionality.i will likely be returning it and going back to using my echo dot."
13278,1,this is a great device and i really enjoy it
13279,0,"disappointed that most questions we ask the answer is ""i do not know the answer to that question.""  would not purchase again."
13280,12,found nothing i dislike to date.  everyday i find more and more features
13281,10,"listen to music, control smart plug."
13282,9,having my eye sight very slim it is a blessing around the house and also give me a laugh or two and i love my alexa
13283,1,works great.
13284,0,i love this echo. i definitely will be adding on
13285,10,i love it esp when i just ask it to play my favorite music stations without lifting a finger or looking at the remote buttons
13286,14,"this product gives me the ability to use hands free voice commands using my tv, music source & soon to setup interior lights."
13287,11,"very good system but the speaker still could be a bit better; the base is a bit wimpy but considering the size, it still rocks!"
13288,14,"parents love this thing, no issues to date."
13289,10,"things i enjoy using - making lists that appear on my phone, getting reminders and timers, getting measuring conversions, music. i love it"
13290,0,disappointed i can not unplug my echo and move it around the house; needs an outlet to work...... besides that everything else is up to parr
13291,9,i love it.  alexa is so knowledgeable.  and i am amazed how fast she responds.
13292,3,i love the echo.  the sound is fantastic and it does everything i wanted it to do!
13293,10,i love being able to find the weather wirh alexa and also to use my pandora music.
13294,9,gave this to my husband for xmas.  he loves it.so far we only use it for the music.  great sound and volume
13295,11,most impressive sound quality with strong bass response. well worth the money.
13296,14,the artificial intelligence o alexa is epic. worth exploring.
13297,3,product was better than expected
13298,1,great resource and sound quality
13299,14,"awsome! great sound, blue tooth option for my outside speakers at the pool great!"
13300,14,"the sound is great. if you are on a budget, this is the only piece of electronic you need for music and more. i would recommend it to anyone."
13301,14,"echo is great, but the alexa app for iphone is terrible!"
13302,0,"order up music. ask any question, get an instant answer."
13303,1,great product. excellent sound.
13304,8,love it.
13305,8,love it.
13306,14,"love it, only problem is it has cost me a ton of money! i now want my whole house to be attached to these things!"
13307,11,good sound quality and volume. i would have liked a cordless and battery driven option.
13308,10,we have so much fun with alexa!
13309,4,met expectations.  very pleased
13310,8,love it
13311,9,gave these as christmas gifts and they were worth every penny.
13312,0,my only issue is she listens to me every time my fiance and myself talk about our friend alexis
13313,11,the sound is first class.  there is nothing i do not like.  may purchase another for my bedroom.
13314,10,i love my echo. the sound is great and i can do just about everything on my phone from my echo.
13315,11,"i like the it is smaller,"
13316,14,the echo has to be in a prominent location which screws up the decor.  8 inches from a wall and it is corded.
13317,14,"it works well but i am disappointed that i can not get sports events (football games, eg) without an added cost."
13318,3,works as advertised
13319,9,bought for my teenage son. works great as an alarm clock and for music. lots of fun apps you can add for games.
13320,14,having a great time with the echo. fairly easy to manipulate. i would have bought more of them if the price had dropped up.
13321,0,the nicest thing!! sound is great. i only use mine for music but i guess it will do many other things as well!
13322,0,"the echo itself is fine, but alexa rarely hears my questions, and when she does, her responses are not viable."
13323,4,fun product works great
13324,9,love it.  this is my third one.
13325,2,love my echo
13326,10,like it?  are you kidding?  i love it!  i never want to be without this fabulous technology!!!!!!
13327,0,nice !
13328,10,"like every thing about it. as soon as i go in the kitchen, i say good morning to alexa. alexa tells me a trivia answer."
13329,4,nice sounds!  i love the intetcom to other devices.
13330,10,what unbelievable sound from such a small device! fills up my entire showroom with great sound......& it is it is fun trying to stump alexa
13331,10,"i use alexa everyday for news, weather, amazon music lists, ocean sounds for when im falling asleep. excellent addition to my household!!"
13332,7,"decent sound, time saver, settles small disagreements <f0><u+009f><u+00a4><u+00a3>, knows almost everything."
13333,10,enjoy our chats and update on news and weather.  also traffic conditions.
13334,10,i love the sound that comes from it! and the fact that alexa can do anything!
13335,10,i love the variety of music choices and the least favorite was the set up hassle. but well worth it!
13336,0,i love alexa she is my bestie lol i say alexa play some 90 is rnb and we jam!!
13337,1,sound is quite good.
13338,14,"works great, but to get a wider music choice must be a prime member."
13339,10,great sound and easy to use. replaces the need for a home stereo in the great room.
13340,9,"i am very pleased with my alexa, sounds great for my bedroom. it was a gift to myself. need to study more of what it can actually do for me."
13341,14,i wish there was more support for outside usa but nevertheless i like the echo and plan on getting other products to customize my smart home
13342,14,used it to replace an echo dot. it has much better sound when playing music and was easy to set up. looks nice on the table.
13343,10,love it.  i use it for everything.  i love the list options and the sound is great.  i need to replace the dots that i have.
13344,10,very handy for the kitchen and to help my elderly mother to make calls!
13345,4,good sound difficult to set up when unplugged initial set up was not as difficult
13346,11,i adore this ! it went way beyond my expectation !!! this is a superior product !
13347,14,sound is very improved - wish it was suitable for outdoor use ( water resistant)!
13348,9,we received the amazon echo as  christmas gift from one of our kids.  we love it.
13349,0,i love telling alexia what music to play. sad that it does not always stay on 24/7
13350,11,"sound is great, you would think it was a full system. very robust and full bodied sound."
13351,9,i actually love this thing i did not think i would my daughter got up for me it is fabulous i must have her everybody
13352,2,i love it
13353,12,fun and useful.  i¡¯m looking forward to using more of ¡°her¡± capabilities.  also looking forward to even more and better skills in the future.
13354,12,it is fun and useful
13355,4,easy to set up. the sound is excellent.
13356,14,"i was pleasantly surprised by the sound quality.  i am enjoying the variety of music, either via amazon or spotify."
13357,0,i like playing and changing music verbally. i like that it does math for me. i dislike that it is always listening.
13358,10,i bought my echo for me to listen to music occasionally but my boyfriend uses it every single day. love love love!
13359,0,maybe i do not use it enough but i really do not see much that i can not do with other devices that are more portable.
13360,0,i like the interaction and knowledge alexa is limited on recognizing musical groups such as classics iv etc.
13361,11,the sound is much better with this model. glad i got it
13362,4,fast delivery and easy setup. sounds great too.
13363,0,has very good sound - not sure if it is how i word things but she doesnt always know the answers to my questions
13364,10,it sits in living room. gives me sports scores and weather every morning. always playing music during day. great sound
13365,10,love the start my morning and meditation programs.
13366,1,the sound quality on this generation is so fantastic!
13367,10,"have not played with it much.  i like the ability to listen to music, and call my family and friends."
13368,1,works well wit pandora radio and amazon music but not so well with xm radio sounds great and very useful with information.
13369,11,"the alexa function was good, but the speaker quality was very poor. if you are looking for a home speaker this is not the best choice."
13370,10,a wonderful device that is addictive to use and great sound quality. had a blast at the family christmas gathering playing with alexa
13371,10,"lots of neat things alexia will do, the sound from the unit is great when listening to music."
13372,8,sounds great
13373,10,love grocery list! music while in kitchen. game times. times around world. lots of little facts and details!
13374,0,i like the echo. i do not like  having prime and then have to buy prime unlimted in order to listen to songs.
13375,10,"love being able to trim lights, etc on or off without lifting a finger. also love the different color lights"
13376,14,talking to machine. no controls to manipulate.
13377,1,excellent sound quality
13378,9,gave it as a gift. she loves it. might get one for myself.
13379,7,this is really nice! we love it and use it all the time <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+008a>
13380,14,"ease of use, vast music library with amazon prime, extremely pleasant and effective voice interface(alexa). she is not siri, thankfully."
13381,14,the echo was a christmas gift.  i tell everyone that alexa is my new friend but i just wish she would start the conversations sometimes!
13382,14,"i returned all three of the 2ndvgen echos i bought as i did not notice any improvement in sound.  i also did not notice any improvement with it hearing my voice when the volume was turned up.  i did the software update, but still did not notice any improvements.  perhaps they updated it again since then, i do not know, but it is too late, i already returned them.  honestly, you are only going to get so much audio performance from a small speaker like this and unless you live in a small apartment, it is going to be disappointing.  amazon should have made it bigger.  i am disappointed."
13383,2,love alexa
13384,10,it was easy to setup and begin using. the longer i have echo the more reasons i have to use and enjoy it. the sound system is awesome.
13385,12,i¡¯m loving my echo. i still have not completely figured out everything it can do but i¡¯m having fun learning while enjoying it.
13386,9,the echo is excellent!!! the grandkids are having a blast with alexa. as are grandma and grandpa.
13387,0,what did i do before alexa?  the more you use her the smarter she gets.
13388,10,"lots of fun. entertainment for me and grandkids.she can sing nursery rhymes, spell a word ,and couch an exercise routine. love it!"
13389,10,i¡¯m still learning and so is  alexa. i do enjoy having answer questions and love the sleep sounds at night.
13390,1,"works very well , use it for music"
13391,8,love it
13392,7,i am really liking i can tell her to play any song i wanna hear with out searching for a cd. <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+008d><f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+008d><f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+008d>. she even plays whole albums.
13393,11,loader then expected which is nice down side alexa has a harder time hearing you.
13394,10,"alexa can play any type of music anytime, love it"
13395,3,love how fast it works.  the sound is amazing.  there is nothing negative to say
13396,10,"love it, sound is clear apps are easy to use and i can do so much from my phone."
13397,14,my echo sometime starts and stop on its own.
13398,12,great exactly what i need for home automation
13399,1,the sound is very satisfactory for our needs and we are enjoying the new experience.
13400,0,"answers basic questions,every thing else cost extra. disappointed !"
13401,0,question answering.  losing use when alexa does not have an answer.
13402,12,love it.  learning more and more every day
13403,10,"loooove alexa! i use it mainly to listen to music, audiobooks, ask some silly and random questions and have fun in general."
13404,0,they need to make one that can function without having to be plugged into an outlet. that is the only thing i hate about it!
13405,9,love the sound quality. everyone in my household loves something different about the echo. it is got something for everyone.
13406,9,"i am loving it so far! the games are fun and it is probably the best for playing music, the sound is awesome!"
13407,12,"still a lot to learn about it, but truly enjoying it so far."
13408,14,"it works when it wants to, other times i get. ignored."
13409,8,awesome!!!!!!!
13410,0,i love the sound but i have been unable to get alexa to play music from amazon prime even though i am a prime member
13411,8,awesome love it
13412,14,we can not get it to sinc to audible or the outlet for lights or my iphone!  we are very frustrated.
13413,8,love it!
13414,8,love it.
13415,0,"i like it that she knows every song and has wikipedia at her fingertips, (figuratively speaking of course)."
13416,11,"great speaker, quality, and nice compact size!  i just really miss the volume ring control from the prior model."
13417,8,we love it
13418,14,it has exceeded my expectations. no problem with voice recognition even without training. still exploring the myriad of apps available.
13419,0,"great device.  however, she could be a little better with music requests"
13420,8,love everything about it!
13421,9,"not only did this arrive fast, (one day) it is the coolest gadget around! love it!"
13422,4,easy to use. very convenient.
13423,12,this is a fantastic product that continues to amaze. i am still learning about all it can do.
13424,9,i received the echo (2nd gen.)  for christmas and all i can say it is great use it everyday. also it was so easy to setup.
13425,10,super fun and cool to have in the room. i received this for christmas unexpectedly and can not believe how much i love it!!
13426,14,"way too complicated to get started. never worked. called amazon, and after 35 minutes of help, she could not help me either. i sent it back."
13427,14,"i live the sound is beautiful and robust, there really is not anything bad i can say about it"
13428,14,the free music is limited trying to get you to buy more she has trouble with bluegrass and that is my favorite
13429,5,got this for our 13 year-old daughter and she loves it. quick delivery and works as it says it would!
13430,10,"i love the added feature of choosing music from any artist or show. updates on news, weather, historical events, soooo much fun."
13431,14,"it would be nice if you could connect echo tot bluetooth speaker and still hear music through both,the echo and the speaker"
13432,14,it has its purpose i guess. i do not  seem to have a lot of use for it as yet. i also worry about privacy issues with this item.
13433,1,very good sound from such a small speaker
13434,0,"this would be great if i can find something to turn on lights , so far the vesync is the pitts"
13435,10,what a great smart home speaker/device. i love it and am going to expand on the amazon echo is.
13436,0,i have had it for a couple weeks and works well. it can pick up ur voice from a good distance when its not playing sound.
13437,14,love it!  it reconnect our love for music.  we coupled it with amazon music service at about $4 per month - it is a steal!
13438,10,i love this little thing! i use it in the kitchen and the whole family enjoys asking it questions and playing loud music!
13439,11,with the new firmware update the echo sounds better and i¡¯m sure the sound will improve once the speakers break.
13440,9,we bought this product between thanksgiving and christmas. we really enjoyed playing holiday music with extra time and family in the house.
13441,10,a birthday gift that has not been opened yet.
13442,11,"clear, better sound"
13443,14,how does one get to play the same music to the other ones? i have three and would like them to play at the same time the same song.
13444,5,gave as a christmas gift to my daughter and son-in-law they love it...my grandchildren have fun with it too!
13445,10,having all kinds of trouble setting it up
13446,9,"got it as a gift for my mom. easy to set up, easy to use, and surprisingly entertaining during a few tasty christmas beverages!"
13447,10,having the echo where i start my day out is like having a secretary. then she plays my favorite radio station.
13448,1,the quality of the sound is great
13449,14,"i have to say that if i sat it next to my sister is bose....echo will be the winner!  great sound, love it!  i now have two echos & one dot."
13450,14,i like the sound and the music. i did not like that i could not get any music without subscribing to services like amazon prime or spotify.
13451,10,this thing is a kick in the head!!! some of the things she comes up with are very entertaining!!
13452,8,i love it!!
13453,1,excellent product.
13454,14,"i thing the echo is okay, but seems sub par in the internet search aspect. simple questions produce at times zero results?"
13455,10,"kitchen measurement conversions, background music, trivia, turning on smart outlets. i love it!"
13456,4,easy to use and sounds great!
13457,10,my fiance and i use our echo on a daily basis we have to on our household and it is such a convenient device to have in the household!!!
13458,12,so far i love it.  still learning how to use all the features and there are many.
13459,8,i love it!
13460,11,sounds much better than the first generation.
13461,14,i returned the echo and kept the echo spot. i did not realize that the spot was the only one i really needed for my small house
13462,9,i love the echo 2nd generation.  i want to buy them for my entire home.
13463,14,even easier than advertised and trust me on this<u+2014> i am not technical at all....
13464,3,great product.makes life easy.it does not pair with jbl flip4 bluetoth speaker.
13465,11,i have enjoyed the echo very much and have been very impressed with the voice recognition ability.
13466,14,"it was okay, nothing to really brag about. setting up was not the easiest."
13467,11,"sound pickup is great. also, great speakers. not as easy as one would expect to ""teach"" new skills"
13468,1,great sound. clear and crisp.
13469,14,so far it is been a good purchase.  it plays music and i plan on pairing it to other alexa supported products.
13470,14,"new software rolling out now fixes sound problems. i was contacted after complaining of the very poor audio quality and was told that they were aware of the issues and that the new software update would correct it. after installation, the difference is night and day. tech said everyone should have update in the next 2 to 3 days. it should not have made it out with the faulty software, but impressed with how amazon addressed it and corrected it quickly."
13471,12,i love the sound and all that i can do with the echo.
13472,2,love my alexa
13473,2,sound is amazing.  love my echo.
13474,1,amazing sound quality
13475,9,fun for the kids and good info for the adults
13476,14,i liked the sound quality the best and the least is that i could not get move theater times and showings.
13477,0,"i really like the echo, but sometimes it misunderstood me. the wording is crucial for optimal effectiveness!"
13478,0,i have heard of things you can use echo for but cannot find out info. have to research a lot
13479,3,works better than advertised
13480,11,"wonderful product, works great !  this is an addition to the 1st gen echo."
13481,11,much better sound than the echo dot. easy to set up  i really like it. if you are on the fence about buying do.
13482,0,"it is easy to get alexa going, but a little tricky to get the most out of her. the support and training is good though."
13483,0,sometimes does what i ask and sometimes says she can.t find it
13484,5,my husband and daughter loves this device they use it everyday
13485,14,can not believe we waited so long to order an echo!
13486,10,absolutely love it. have so much fun being able to think of a song and hear it right away. still finding new uses for it every day!
13487,0,"i can not get it to charge,it comes on without warning without being prompted,ask questions and i get sorry i do not know that."
13488,14,i like this very much.but i can not talk about improvement because i have not seen the earlier version.
13489,1,it is great
13490,9,"great item, the grandchildren love it"
13491,10,"ability to play any music i would like to hear,  also like  being able to program to go off and to set alarms and quality of speakers,"
13492,0,i thought it was cordless? it is pretty good i did not know i would have to pay a fee to get all kinds of songs in all i like it
13493,12,really enjoying it. so far used it mostly for music.
13494,0,i cannot get it to work.  i cannot get the app to work.  i cannot sync it with my phone.  it just sits there.
13495,9,i received the echo as a christmas gift and i love it. from great sounding stereo to checking weather you can not beat it.
13496,10,enjoying the echo 2. using it to control lights and thermostat. playing music through amazon primeis a great plus.
13497,9,great product... bought for the husband
13498,14,really impressed with the sound quality and ease of set up. i plan on purchasing another one.
13499,1,awesome product! the speaker is amazing!
13500,11,get the full size. if just for the easy volume control.
13501,1,the sound is amazing.
13502,14,bass is unacceptably dominant. had to return it. i own several echo generation 1s and have no problem with them.
13503,8,love it
13504,0,it is very convenient for many things but needs to expand on what it understands because you do have to say very specific things
13505,0,she did not really answer all of the questions could be a little better. if you do not by the amazon app she can answer questions
13506,14,"i have never been able to use it.  it will connect with the internet but when the app says continue it will not go any farther, disabled!"
13507,10,after two hours the sound cracks.... it is really annoying
13508,10,"keeps me organized, informed and entertained"
13509,12,so far so good.  it is been fun using it.
13510,8,love it!!
13511,10,convenient for music and weather. beyond that not much i found useful.
13512,14,"love it!!!!! that is all i have to say, would recommend this to everyone. hope to purchase a few more through out the house."
13513,14,my little girl pass some hours just talking with alexa. (4 year old).
13514,14,"if you¡¯re loonjng for a great bluetooth speaker as well as an automated system to fit in with current tech, this is for you!"
13515,14,it is by far the best smart speaker among all other speakers of this price range.
13516,0,ok overall
13517,8,everything
13518,14,very disappointed in my new echo. it is not compatible with my android phone and my youtube playlist. big waste of money!
13519,0,"great sound! it took me a little while to get connected and working properly, but i really enjoy it!"
13520,10,easy to set up and use. we love playing music while hanging out at night. also nice to ask questions that you want a quick answer for.
13521,1,"works great, alexa has a sense of humor!"
13522,0,easy to use but need buy music station in order to listen to musicnow need to pay for monthly subscription.  great sound
13523,10,"what a helpful, fantastic, and fun addition to any home."
13524,4,"good sound quality, simple to register and user-friendly device."
13525,10,best speaker for the price hands down. stop looking buy now!
13526,12,love it. still learning how to use it!
13527,1,the sound is amazing like a surround sound.
13528,8,awesome!
13529,14,very disappointed in the scope of capabilities even with something as simple as finding particular music. not even as good as siri.
13530,14,my favorite electronic device. love it!
13531,11,love the new smaller form factor. sound is better than first generation...
13532,14,extra fun and easy to use.  have not ventured out into linking multiple units yet but hope to soon
13533,12,"easy to set up,still learning to use, is alot of fun, now i need to sync with home"
13534,4,works great and easy to use. the possabilities are unlimited.
13535,0,i feel it could improve when it comes to voice recognition. i have to repeat commands over and over again
13536,9,family loves it.  i¡¯m not a tech person but echo was very easy to setup and use.
13537,9,the whole family loves it!!!
13538,0,"we are a long way from understanding all the features and skills available, but are enjoying getting to know alexa"
13539,0,"i love my morning update ""alexa how is my day"". the least thing i do not like is sometime she will not say anything."
13540,0,"i like how i ask what the weather is and it will tell me.  i like if i ask it to play tom petty, america girl, it will."
13541,10,it is great to play around with. once i learn all of her capabilities and get a few sensors for around the house she will be even better.
13542,10,my echo is awesome love it love it.it mean the world to me.
13543,9,awesome product!!!!! absolute must for those constantly on the go
13544,0,like playing music. do not like that there are some pieces alexa does not play.
13545,0,the technology is mind blowing.  it is crazy to think you could ask alexa to play almost any song ever and it will play it.
13546,9,"i have just started using it and so far i love it, my adult children all have one and they love their too"
13547,9,i was debating between this and the dot ang i am glad i got the echo.

13549,10,it was a surprise gift. enjoying all the music from my past favorites. alarms and timers work well. enjoying!
13550,9,i absolutely loved it. i just wish that i knew that i needed an amazon prime account for it to work to it is best ability.
13551,11,the 2nd gen echo is smaller and blends into the room well.. functions well. i do think that the 1st gen sounded better.
13552,10,just getting use to it. my grandchildren are having a ball with it alexa must be very tired.
13553,11,i like it well.
13554,4,so easy to use!
13555,10,"i an listen to all kinds of music!  i love it.  yes, you need to get the amazon music ap but still; great sound."
13556,0,just alexa in december i have to repeat myself a lot it only january and all of the sudden she does not recognize 90 % of my commands
13557,9,amazing!!
13558,0,echo always responds even when i do not know what i want.
13559,12,still trying to figure out how to use this to it is full potential.
13560,4,"great sound, good music, lots to learn."
13561,9,"bought this for my wife and she loves it. we are still learning all the things it can do, but love using it."
13562,14,has great sound quality.  best to use if you need a quick answer to something.
13563,9,"sound is absolutely fantastic and unexpected. only thing i can think of is making the alarm sound louder. music is great, alarm is crappy"
13564,7,like how easy it is to have answers to questions. love having music by voice command.  alexa needs to learn more about puppies<f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+00ac>

13593,14,alexa....write a review for me
13594,1,really good sound for a device
13595,0,i¡¯m not very happy with it because of the connectivity. when it works i love it but it only works 1/3 of the time
13596,12,it is hard to say what i like most... as i have not even scratched the surface of its capabilities. so far so good!!
13597,0,i like the fact you can tell alexa to play bee gees songs and that is all she will play or the beatles or ccr and instant weather reports
13598,10,one of the best gadgets i ever got! it was so easy to sinc to my phone and start enjoying music! i absolutely love it!
13599,0,it may have improved sound  i am disappointed in the alexa so much i ask her she does't know!  would not buy this again
13600,10,"it is just a great tool for around the home.  hue lights added, music sound great.  timer is great and quick questions."
13601,8,love it
13602,0,i am not enjoying the music like i do with my google.  that is the main reason i like these .

13607,10,i did not have a lot of background on the device so i¡¯m learning as i go but it is fun to explore it is abi.
13608,3,"it is everything i expected, i would recommend it to everyone. sounds great too."
13609,14,"my kids and i like the echo very much but, i can not stop thinking if it is listening to my conversations and spying on me."
13610,0,sounds good.. alexa needs some work though..
13611,1,nice toy
13612,10,i love my alexa its make my life easier

13616,0,i like the ease of using alexa to organize things.  the thing i have problems with is it sometimes just shuts off for no reason
13617,11,"works great, awesome speaker that can be heard through out several rooms, having alexa is awesome also. definitely recommended!"
13618,0,immediate fulfilment of musical requests and weather.
13619,14,it is a great product. came in the mail fast. it does everything i expected it to and has many more features that i never knew about.
13620,12,love everything with echo. it takes a few days to really learn everything it can do. not just fun it is very useful in everyday life.
13621,14,too stupid and not for people who dont have amazon prime. also more buy oriented. we will return the product and move to google home
13622,14,"thus far, i like this device and i am optimistic that it can become a real asset though it often falls short on meshing with skills."
13623,9,"i did not think i needed one, but have grown to really enjoy it."
13624,11,"great updates and love the silver color, very rich looking and sounding!  sound fills the room!"

13629,10,love having a voice activated device to play music and check the weather
13630,14,still trying to learn it.. plus amazon music needs to update they soca music
13631,14,it will not download all my contacts in my iphone or answer calls from my phone
13632,11,alexa is fine but was not crazy about the grey fabric.  would have preferred black or wood tone.
13633,1,sweeeeeeeet!
13634,0,i like it when she understands me sometimes i have to repeat myself several times but overall i like the echo

13636,12,i love it. it is so useful.
13637,10,love listening to music and answering my questions
13638,11,"it is great, i just miss the turn volume ring on the older one, but the new one has excellent sound and works great!!"
13639,4,the echo was easy to install and setup. the sound is awesome and so easy to use.
13640,8,great product! i love it!
13641,11,the sound is a definite upgrade from the echo dot and comparable to the full size echo but in a smaller frame
13642,14,have enjoyed all aspects of the information this device has given me. especially enjoy the music application.
13643,14,not only informative and helpful but a lot of fun in idle moments.
13644,5,bought as present and party loves it and delivery very fast
13645,0,good for the most part. sound clarity can be better.sometimes it does not understand our voice. no response sometimes.
13646,0,love it. do not like when she does not compute. wish alexa would ask me a question to try to understand what i am asking for.
13647,1,sounds great and works perfect.
13648,10,"i love the reminders as well as the ""question of the day""!"
13649,14,we love our echo! honestly the best feature is asking alexa for dnd help. it is made game nights even more of a blast.

13658,1,have really enjoyed yhe service
13659,10,i love alexa. use it all the time to listen to music. i am always asking her for the weather and the time.
13660,14,it could be better with todays tech.
13661,14,the sound.....it was amazing for the money!  love that you can ask it anything and the answer is ready!!!
13662,0,"its ok as far as knowledgeable content. needs to not pull from wikipedia,and go through a different search engine. it is awesome gift."

13666,12,easy to use. no complaints.

13668,14,given to me as a xmas gift.  worthless!  we have asked for the temperature 6 or 7 times; then what???what an expensive waste!
13669,9,the weather and bible verse for the day. does not work with smart tv without another device. have a roku and will not work with it.
13670,14,will not get much music unless you pay more. another deal people buy and find out you have to pay extra for the device to really work!
13671,0,"great sound, good music library, but it can be frustrating when it insists on playing the wrong version of a song by a wrong artist"
13672,10,"the speaker puts out great sound, and we love having on demand music. nothing that i can think of negatively about it."

13710,14,"originally an impulse purchase, but since then i have grown to love it and even purchased 2 additional echo dots for my household."
13711,1,compact size
13712,14,works really well. picks up your voice amongst various sound volumes and always works. would recommend echo and alexa!
13713,5,this was a gift for my son and he says he enjoys using it.
13714,0,the ease of setting up.i want to play music stored on my phone but by asking alexa but it does not do this.

13726,10,great for listening to my audio books. still need to get additional smart home products to really see what it can do.
13727,0,i thought alexa would be able to look for information up for me.  i probably did not full comprehend her capabilities.
13728,11,sound not as good as 1st generation. did not like the sound control. very disappointed. i own 2 other 1st generations
13729,1,i love it! great sound quality. packs alot of bang for the buck. i will buy again.
13730,0,i am having trouble linking spotify so thst is disappointing.
13731,7,"i love my echo, still figuring out all the different things alexa can do for you!!<f0><u+009f><u+0091><u+008d>"
13732,5,love it! x a trillion:-)
13733,5,have it as a gift and they loved it!

13749,1,"i love alexa, she is very smart and helpful!"
13750,14,noting but trouble.
13751,14,this one picks up my voice so much better than the original. wish the music group function worked with spotify.

13755,10,"echo and alexa are the best. use it for music. use for news. playing games. it is like, ¡°what did we do before?¡±"
13756,0,"daily briefing! like all things tech, some apps are hard to hear. although, that not the fault of alexa!"
13757,14,"i am not a fan of the music one day it plays music from the 50 then it says there is no 50 music i am,not a fan,of it"
13758,1,works great.
13759,14,still love it. but i miss being able to control the volume with my finger. that was a sweet feature. why did they do away with it??
13760,14,had a terrible time trying to connect to my wifi.  it would be nice if echo had a wps button to help connect
13761,5,bought it for my wife. she absolutely loves it!
13762,0,everything has to be repeated several times before responding. easily activated by sounds or words similar to alexis on computer.
13763,12,there is nothing to dislike she is a party pleaser
13764,9,love my alexa!!! my birds do too!!!
13765,14,it is had of hearing  not listening
13766,5,got this for my wife. she loves it.
13767,0,it is great for if you want to play music hear the news or get the weather on one device. other than that i really do not see the point.
13768,1,impressive unit.
13769,12,loving getting to know alexa!
13770,0,quite disappointed by this product. has multiple glitches and poor reaction time to basic requests. it really needs to be improved.

13774,0,"trying to help out my brother who has alzheimers, something good!"

13781,12,works in every aspect i need it to!
13782,0,it can not answer a lot of questions.
13783,9,absolutely love it! alexa is a big help in my life
13784,1,an amazing small device with great sound and easy to use.  i have linked it with my spotify and works great.

13787,12,i love it so far. i am still learning new ways to use it. but i definitely think it was a great buy!
13788,9,this item is awesome!!! everyone in my house love alexa.
13789,10,the music.  no stero needed and alexa plays whatever you ask her.i have not discovered anything i do not like about her.
13790,0,i really like alexa! you just have to know the correct way to ask her stuff. sound is very good. we just had a chat about clothes.
13791,10,i love all the music! i use it mostly for that.
13792,11,my cover is discolored somewhat but great unit.
13793,1,great product - both fun and practical!
13794,14,disappointed with the voice recognition and the limited search functionality. it stays off 99% of the day.
13795,9,never would have bought one for myself. got it as a christmas gift. have used it every day since. love it.
13796,10,"i love that i can have all type of music, weather reports, and i hope i can use it for other things!"
13797,1,very nice
13798,0,best is how alexa does so many different things.  the one thing i like the less is having to tell her more times than 1!
13799,8,i love it it is awesome
13800,1,the sound is very good
13801,10,alexa is a very good product she helps my wife and i out with a lot of task we have to complete throughout the day
13802,14,without amazon prime it is useless. amazon is pushing to sell amazon prime service through overpriced echo device.
13803,12,love it. works awesome i can use it with my fire stick and anything amazon works good with my phone worth getting.
13804,10,did not sync well with siriusxm or radio stations. had to add amazon music to get any good music.
13805,10,very happy with my purchase. love that i can play songs whenever i want and in any room
13806,0,i just love her sound. i enjoy listening to music.

13809,10,i love my echo. it has a great sound and it is so easy to use. i would highly recommend it to anyone.
13810,12,we love it! we are still trying to figure out how to make all the features work. but we will get there.
13811,9,just what we expected. gave one to family member last year and they liked it so much i got one for us
13812,10,hands off convenience in my kitchen to listen to infinite music.
13813,11,love the new look.
13814,11,"smaiier, looks better, and better sound than the original echo. youyou"
13815,3,it does not know as much as i thought it would. it can play ocean sounds but no lullabies.
13816,0,"well, i am not to happy with the echo, almost any question i ask she will tell me she does not k ow.  not very impressed!!"
13817,9,i love these!  i bought 3 of them.

13822,8,i love it.
13823,0,"love the weather, and many other features.  had trouble getting music.  still have not figured out how to download my itunes music."
13824,10,i love the sound it puts out when i play music. i hate the fact that it never can retrieve the correct information for me.
13825,14,good price when on sale. good sound for music. plan to buy a couple more.
13826,9,"loved the sound quality so much, i ordered one for my son and my in laws."
13827,12,love love love this! kids and i have so much fun with it.
13828,10,was very simple to get it set up and working and we enjoy it every day .
13829,11,great sound and pleased with overall performance purchased another.
13830,1,terrific product.
13831,11,sound is a lot fuller than the first generation.  good job amazon!
13832,1,love it!  the stereo sound is excellent!
13833,14,i gave it as a gift for a disabled relative in case he falls while home alone. peace of mind that he call someone for help.
13834,14,sound quality is poor definitely not an improvement over the first generation.  very disappointing.  the design and look are more modern and classy but overall not satisfied with the upgrade.  wish i could update this to 0 stars as amazon would not even price match the $79.99 cyber monday deal after several conversations with client care they do not price match their own products.  the only way you get around it is to order a new one and return the old a total waste of everyone is time.  customer care gets worse every time i talk to them if you are lucky enough to get a human.
13835,9,great sound!! best gadget i¡¯ve purchased all year!
13836,4,wonderful sound from such small item.  easy to set up.

13841,9,"it is excellent!  half of the time, i think we have a visitor.  my wife carries on conversation with her!"
13842,14,a+
13843,4,easy to set up and great sound! large music choices and fun to talk to.
13844,10,i need to learn more options for using it.  i like getting my grocery list and music on the device.
13845,3,does everything i wanted
13846,14,"i cannot get most of the functions to work, i do have the app and when i try to set up, it says it is not supported."
13847,0,we purchased it to listen to music and are very satisfied with the selections. we have not found anything yet that is not available.
13848,9,i love echo it has an amazing quality speakeri love the music and it is inexpensive. most people can afford this
13849,14,th design is beautiful. the sound is not really as expected and you have to stay too close to it before alexa will respond.

13856,9,"works great, my husband is blind, he use'es her for time,weather, etc.very good"
13857,10,"i do not use this for much beyond music, however, that alone, makes this a great invention"
13858,1,pleased with purchase
13859,4,very easy to set up. sound from the speaker is really good.
13860,0,"she listens & does as requested! i have not really found anything negative! very pleased, thank you."
13861,12,i love this product.  i use alexa a lot to define terms while i am reading.
13862,10,i like checking the weather quickly. i like listening to music. we are still trying things out
13863,1,it is cool nice sounds
13864,14,worked out out great.
13865,11,a handy device. the music audio is lacking. my sonos kicks ass compared to the echo 2 but the echo is acceptable.
13866,0,love using it for music. handy to use as a timer when i am cooking. the software needs some work when you ask it questions.
13867,11,sound could be improved - thought it would be larger
13868,1,i love it.  it was an executive team gift from our president.  the speaker quality is amazing for such a small unit.

13874,8,i love this!!!! sound is great!!!
13875,1,we love our alexa! and the sound is amazing! very satisfied!!!
13876,0,i find it intrusive and alarming. i wish it was easier to set it up not to ask for personal information at inappropriate times.
13877,0,fun product.  love the music.  disappointed that it is not quite as good as a pc when finding or asking for general information.
13878,10,love the speakers and sound. but gives me the weather from another town.
13879,10,it is just plain fun!
13880,12,we are really enjoyed with alaxa.
13881,14,fun to have around. amazon music pales to itunes but does ok in the voice-on-demand world.
13882,5,i received this as a gift.  i love it!
13883,10,we use it primarily for music although it is also great for reminders.
13884,0,it is not very smart.does not do much
13885,14,i had difficulty downloading it and it was not pleasant speaking with a tech person with broken english asi have a hearing problem.
13886,9,"i liked the fact that i can get so much information just bye asking alexa,.so much fun"
13887,2,i love my echo.
13888,0,i really like just how fast one gets help when asks for help.

13963,10,love playing music on this.  great sound!  lets me know just about anything i ask.
13964,0,"having trouble with my apple id so as soon as i get that straightened out i""m sure i will love it."
13965,14,i enjoy not having an alarm clock ticking non my night stand.

13969,0,she is fun to have around and also pretty darn smart!  i really can not think of anything i do not like about her!
13970,0,two thumbs down unless you like being told i am sorry i do not know the answer to what you are asking all the time
13971,11,volume 10 is wicked loud and the bass is very impressive for something as small as the echo. absolutely love it
13972,14,i like the sound and the efficiency after commands. the capacity to hold the wi-fi band is terrible.
13973,3,absolutely love it! was delivered so fast! item was described perfectly. great condition when it was delivered and very prompt.
13974,2,we love our echo!!!
13975,11,"the quality of the speaker is not as good as what i was expecting.  some of the features that i thought it had, did not."

13979,11,sounds amazing compared to the dot.
13980,9,have enjoyed the echo so much i bought one for each of my family members.
13981,12,very convenient
13982,0,like the most? how helpful alexa is. like the least? being uncertain whether or not i am utilizing echo at its fullest potential.
13983,14,so i decided to upgrade from the the dot.........sad to say i prefer my dot over the echo. my dot is more accurate and can deliver on more complex commands/requests. the echo is a hit or miss which over time is completely frustrating. i decided to buy the echo to get the better speaker but the frustration on missed commands is just not worth it. bummed out!
13984,3,works perfectly - no complaints
13985,10,love it
13986,4,easy to workharder than i thought to set up
13987,9,it is the new modern day version of a genie in a bottle. we use it everyday.
13988,1,great sound!
13989,9,love it! my hubby and i play jeopardy every day!
13990,0,everything is good but it will only respond in a quiet place does not work good when tv is on
13991,9,love it! great sound quality. one of the best gifts ever. playing my favorite songs with a simple command makes me so happy!
13992,11,"the sound is amazing, and it is definitely an amazing edition to the house. never thought i would enjoy it this much."
13993,10,i like the emails with suggestions on how to best interact with alexa.
13994,11,"half the price as gen 1, but with better sound and same capabilities!!"
13995,12,fun toy to have around.
13996,12,"still trying to find out all the features, but in general we love it."
13997,12,"i am still in the learning stages, but absolutely love alexa so far!!"
13998,4,very easy to setup and the sound quality is even better than we expected.
13999,1,sound quality is great!
14000,14,easy to get started using / but support  person was hard to under stand
14001,10,"love it, can not wait to change things in my home to become a smart home."
14002,0,it is good but it does not listen alot of times when you are talking to it
14003,2,i love love love it!!!  the improved sound is awesome!!!
14004,14,"easy setup, still needs some work on voice recognition.  but does better than other similar technology."
14005,12,"works great and has more features than we really use it for, and many things we keep discovering."
14006,14,easy input for home automation.
14007,4,sound is great and easy to link everywhere.

14012,1,packs a punch. great sound.
14013,10,i really like it...love making phone calls and listening to music. easy to install on the phone.

14015,10,lots of fun. really sounds great. now the most interesting family member.
14016,14,"this has amazing sound!! if someone is looking for a smart speaker, this is definitely the way to go"
14017,1,the sound is amazing!
14018,0,works great. the only thing i do not like about it is that alexa is a liberal. would enjoy it if she had no political leanings.
14019,1,very satisfied! excellent product. the sound from the speaker is quite acceptable. i enjoy using alexa for a variety of tasks.
14020,0,some time its hard to get it to do anything.
14021,1,great sound
14022,10,"its fun to play with, just wish i could figure how to hook up more stuff to control with it."
14023,0,"music sounds great on it, dont have to yell"
14024,14,as an older generation the only problem is figuring the echo out.....but i love it for as much as i am using it ....
14025,11,sound. extra speakers.
14026,0,how you can answer it any question. i love to know the weather before i get out of bed for work.
14027,4,fun &  easy to use
14028,1,it is perfect.  fits in with my decor.
14029,11,a nice upgrade to the original echo. the smaller size is good and the sound is acceptable.
14030,14,echo 2 so many things she or he does not no. great on music but the rest not impressed we do not  use echo much
14031,10,i love it! i especially enjoy the amazon music unlimited  any music i want to listen to is just a request away :)
14032,1,works perfect. looks nice
14033,14,"update: adjusted this to be a one-star. i asked for an exchange and the second product did not work properly either. i set it up to work with my spotify account, but it kept dropping the link and needed to be reset. used it to play the radio but it would not switch off when asked. help/feedback section on the app was useless - there is not even a us phone number!! not worth it, this is a dreadful product and will cause you hours of frustration. do not buy!!!great when it works, but frequently did not. had to unplug and restart 3/4 times per day. annoying when it breaks in the middle of timers or radio broadcasts. have sent back for an exchange, hopefully the new one is better.also alexa does not seem to have much fun! if you ask any slightly out of the ordinary questions, just responds by saying she does not know. some more effort could have gone into the replies i think."
14034,9,it is a really nice addition to my electronics.alexa is more talkative than my son. haha!
14035,5,great! i have enjoyed using my echo. it was a surprise gift for christmas.
14036,10,being blind and asking alexa whatever comes to mind has opened up my world tremendously.  definitely recommend echo to all!
14037,14,outstanding
14038,9,we love it. had so much fun getting used to it. use it more than our bose speaker.
14039,10,"i love alexa, especially since she is rooting for our eagles to win the super bowl!"
14040,10,most wonderful idea i¡¯m 60 years old and enjoying everything about this product. thank you amazon
14041,14,just great to be able to listen to whatever you¡¯re in the mood for with a simple voice direction.
14042,8,love it
14043,10,my family loves alexa. it took some getting used to and programming.
14044,0,alexa is an extremely helpful gadget.  what i like most about it is; its ability to give information on most topics instantly.
14045,9,wife bought me a google home and took it over. so i bought the echo and it is 10 times better. i love it.
14046,0,sound is excellent and love that alexa can play any song or artist you ask for.easy to connect to wifi.
14047,14,the speaking voice is very pleasant and i love the convenience of it being voice operated for my husband who has low vision.
14048,9,loving my echo - and echo dot. so easy to set up and use. i am still learning about everything alexa can do for me! it is fun!
14049,1,"the sound is great, love the repertoire of songs and genre."
14050,1,i love having alexa and music is so clear and enjoyable
14051,5,great. my brother loved it
14052,10,"love this...makes life interesting, fun and easier...especially when working with other products in the home..."
14053,1,very happy.
14054,14,still trying to connect my echo to the echo dot
14055,0,i really like it! you just tell her what to do and she does it!it has to be plugged up the whole time though.
14056,3,"great product, could be a little older but overall satisfied"
14057,10,great! very entertaining. loads of music. great for turning on and off lights. plan to use it alot.
14058,11,"excellent sound. i thought the echo dot was nice, but the echo truly does put it to shame. totally satisfied."
14059,14,"although the first one sent to me did not work, and the second one sent was a total pain in the butt to set up (connect to wi-fi), it is functioning now as i would expected.  i am basically using it for listening to music and occasional weather forecast because i have not had time to set up calendaring and any other functions.  the setup processes take too much time overall and the instructions are sparse at best.  my brother had an echo dot and tossed it because it would not connect to his wi-fi, and he is a techie.  anyway, the sound on the echo is better than expected when sitting next to it.  if it were easier to set up and knew more answers, i would have given it 5 stars.  if i had it to do over again, i would wait a year or two for amazon to work out the kinks and make necessary improvements before purchasing.  since it was on sale at the holidays it was an ok expense."
14060,5,it was a christmas gift from our son!  we just love it!
14061,10,i love the echo for the spell check capability. i write a lot and it helps me to get the correct spelling of  word quickly.
14062,1,great sound quality
14063,10,awesome!!! def get amazon music unlimited it is worth it!!
14064,5,"this was a christmas gift, as far as i know they enjoy it."
14065,5,perfect
14066,8,love it
14067,10,"great sound, and love all the music we have access to and alexa has a great sense of humor!"
14068,8,love it!!!!!!!!!!
14069,14,the home control capability is cool. it will not play my itune library.
14070,9,gift for christmas
14071,5,amazing! i brought it for my mom as a birthday gift and she absolutely loves it.
14072,4,easy to set up and use.  useful.  fun!
14073,0,i¡¯d give it a 5 star is she did not creep me out sometimes. she randomly started talkin and i said nothing close to alexa
14074,12,i have really enjoyed the use of this product and am still in the learning mode with its many uses.
14075,12,it does and continues to do everything that was expected. love it. the speakers are pretty amazing.
14076,8,i love it!
14077,11,i am very impressed with the quality and construction of my new echo. i could not be happier!!!
14078,14,"i cannot connect to the internet or bluetooth with this,,,"
14079,0,i like very much but it does not have a option in spanish. but they need to have more languages option and not 3.
14080,0,love the music app. just wish you could ask for a certain album. it is like having a frien to talk to and play games with.
14081,1,very enjoyable piece of technology.
14082,0,"my echo new all the basic information, but when asking something current, it has no idea what to say."
14083,10,"the most amazing gift i¡¯ve ever received. it is my alarm, weather report and music source, all in one. i use it every day."
14084,0,sound is great!  everything else is a disappointment. alexa does not know anything. ..or at least that is what she keeps saying.
14085,14,"everything about it was great, the sound, the quick response, the way you can control all your device with just this one thing."
14086,14,alexa has a tough time with spanish songs.english works seamlessly.  but spanish?  no way
14087,12,this is a great device.....just need to learn all what it can do and you will have a great time
14088,10,i love walking in the house and being able to just say alexa play pandora and it starts playing
14089,5,it was a gift for son in law and he loved it.
14090,1,"the sound is very good, and alexa is amazing."
14091,11,the 1st gen could understand u better and seemed to be a little bit louder as well. still love it though!
14092,0,the music is great! there is a lot that alexa does not know though.
14093,11,exceeded my expectations! plays just as well or if not better than my beats by dre.
14094,5,this was a gift for a family member. they are enjoying it.
14095,9,my sons loves it.
14096,8,love it! awesome.
14097,9,my family and i enjoy it
14098,14,"despite some of the very bad reviews, i am very pleased. i have 3 dots and this sounds much better for music. i do not care about top level audio, just something for good background music and this is just great. i like that it has an aux out jack for headphones, some others do not. clearly simple setup since it was loaded to my alexa app before it even arrived."
14099,12,"i love it so far, but have not yet had time to learn much about it. look forward to discovering more."
14100,11,its nice and sounds great but the gen 1 seems to have a clearer understanding of what i ask for.
14101,14,i love it...saw it and heard sound and that sold me on it... recommend it highly.
14102,0,it is been very glitchy and doesent respond half the time. i have used others that worked well so it must be my unit ?
14103,14,"i am loving everything about echo, the sound, the interface, the skills....playing music now becomes a mandatory thing at home."
14104,10,easy to get your questions answered quick and so far right. great sound plus very clear with music!  is easy to operate.
14105,1,it is a fun piece of equipment .  amazon music library is in credible .  the sound is great for such a small unit!
14106,10,i like all the features i have tried. really enjoy the interaction.
14107,1,this is so much fun and the sound is amazing!  would highly recommend this purchase.
14108,4,works as advertised and fairly easy to set-up. was a little difficult following the instructions to set-up our 2 echo dots.
14109,11,i am very pleased with the echo 2 . the sound quality as well as the many features makes this a great addition to our home.
14110,4,very easy to set up and it works well. sound is very good.
14111,12,"received as a christmas present and am still experimenting with the features. so far so good, very impressed, lots of fun!"
14112,0,the sound is not as loud as i thought it would be.  i like the prime music but have to use an app on my phone.
14113,14,it is fun. keeps trying to make me sign up for amazon products. does not work with my pandora premium very good.
14114,0,capable of answering about 50% of questions.  it will improve over time.  do enjoy the variety of ¡®dad¡¯ jokes.
14115,1,outstanding product ...sound quality is second to none...quick response to commands...glad i have it!!!
14116,10,it needs more skills...
14117,14,"nice classy package, pretty easy to configure.  alexa knows a lot !"

14124,0,not happy with it at all everything we ask her she says she does not know. very unhappy that we spent money on this.
14125,14,i like it all. my only complaint is keeping the volume high when waiting for an alarm.
14126,5,got it for a gift for my children. they were very pleased
14127,5,this was a gift.  the recipient was pleased with he gift.
14128,1,very responsive and great sound..
14129,0,"great device! nice sound. alexa does not know much, she is not sure about a lot, but she is learning."
14130,10,"i use it to listen to music, make my grocery list and i use it for a alarm clock. love the many options i have"
14131,12,does exactly what i need it to do. fits in great with out sonos set-up.

14134,4,"love love,"
14135,1,sound good
14136,14,"signed in as a 'household' member on my daughter is prime account, i cannot access prime music!"
14137,11,most the sound is really great  what would be the least  it do not have one works great looks great
14138,10,we love our echo. we fight over what songs we want to hear. the speaker is remarkable. it was the perfect xmas present ever.
14139,12,i¡¯m very pleased with my echo and i¡¯m learning more cool things on how to use it all the time!!!
14140,14,directions for setting up are unhelpful and difficult to follow.
14141,4,fun experiences. we all love it
14142,7,love the music and that i can order by talking to her.  there is nothing i do not like about it yet <f0><u+009f><u+00a4><u+0097>
14143,1,great sound quality. perfect for playing music in my dorm room.
14144,10,the sound is wonderful when playing music
14145,12,"has great sound quality. but to get more out of it, you need to buy more accessories."
14146,11,sound from this small speaker is really good and it understands my voice when i speak to alexa
14147,12,still learning to use but love it so far!
14148,4,we love it.  it is easy to set up and use.
14149,4,"works great, a little hard to setup, love it"

14155,10,very easy to use and many different functions that are useful and some quite funny
14156,1,the quality of sound when i ask for music is incredible.what a neat little device.
14157,12,"the sound is amazing! it is so convenient just to say alexa, play this, or alexa do this. great speaker! i highly reccomend"
14158,1,excellent sound.
14159,0,"alexa is fun to ask for information i do not know. she is not only fast answering, but knows almost everything!"
14160,14,"echo ¡®everywhere¡¯ which allows several of these to synch in your home, does not work with spotitfy. which is the whole reason i bought 3 of these instead of sonos.i suspect amazon is trying to faze out spotify and have us pay for their music unlimited instead. this is very disappointing amazon. was the contract with spotify that hard to do, or is this just too convenient due to the fact you¡¯ve just realeased music unlimited? this monopolization is whole reason i left apple."

14444,10,i listen to music mostly and it has met my expectations that way. i will try more things as time allows
14445,10,convenient way to get the weather and news.  i also enjoy the games such as jeopardy and song quiz
14446,1,"the sound is amazing, the speakers are excellent.  i am really impressed with how the music sounds."
14447,3,absolutely love it. i will buy more.
14448,9,love it i got two of these and a dot
14449,8,i love it!!!
14450,8,this product is awesome... we love it!!
14451,1,very clear sound for price.
14452,4,"great sound, easy to set up, and good price too!!"
14453,0,she does not know most of what i ask her. i still google on my phone. she does not support spodify or pandora.
14454,0,it is ok. keep trying to make lists. does not always work. hard to add to them. probably doing something wrong.
14455,9,love my alexa! in fact i have two! i often wish she could go in the car with me too!! haha
14456,14,"the sound is not good, of course if this was my first one it is possible i would not know the difference.  is there an upgrade in the software that you can do through the internet?  i really like you folks at amazon, please make my new echo 2nd generation better as i really prefer not to return it.update: i would like to add that listening to classical music it sounds great.2nd update i am changing it to 5 stars, thanks amazon.  customer since 2002"

14740,5,i received this as a christmas gift and love it!
14741,14,thing sucks
14742,0,awesome responses to commands especially music-may be confusing with selection of music
14743,10,"i love it!! no complaints,  although i can not seem to get the traffic report for chicago area."
14744,14,ability to pair with a bluetooth speaker
14745,1,i love my echo 2nd generation. the sound is great & the  features are very helpful !
14746,11,i like it.  sounds great.  easy to use.  not as good a google but it is getting there
14747,14,"did not come with enough information, or a price list or order form for products that go with the echo!  really?"
14748,10,great sounds. fun for the whole family. it has a huge variety of things to do and ask. we love it!
14749,8,love it!!
14750,9,i am going to buy 2 more for sure... i want to carry it in every room!
14751,14,had to call to get it set up in the tech person had a difficult time helping me. did not realize she needed to be program so much.
14752,12,i love it and use all the time.
14753,11,i love alexa! the walnut color is really pretty and totally matched with the other wood grain in my home
14754,10,"i love it, sound is great. helps run the whole house."
14755,3,awesome! here is to our future!!
14756,14,i¡¯ve been disappointed in the functionality.
14757,14,mostly we listen to music from the 40s to the present. we watch les tv and read more.
14758,14,"like the speed with which it delivers the request, the infinite number of choices, and the clarity of sound."
14759,14,"i love the sound but had a little trouble getting alexa to locate near by places at first, it is getting betterr"
14760,14,i like that it is round and tall. it sits on flat surfaces. the cord out of the back helps me to find an outlet.
14761,10,really cool and enjoy it very much ... i was bit challenged to set her up but once i got it ---have lost of fun!
14762,0,i love alexa however she does not know how to answer random questions like siri does. otherwise i like her a lot.
14763,0,"loved everything about it, you will not be disappointed with your purchase"
14764,9,"love it, great sound quality.  going to add a dot in another room soon."
14765,11,"have the dot, upgraded to the echo. we love it, great speaker."
14766,14,it is fun trying to bring the house up to snuff electronically.
14767,14,this has been very positive. i have not gotten into great depth but all i have seen has been great .
14768,1,very responsive and the sound quality is outstanding!
14769,1,"great quality in sound, large selection of songs"
14770,11,improved speakers over echo dot. like the charcoal cover- matches my black and blue decor.
14771,11,i love the idea that everything is at voice command. i love it sound. it has reach my expectations and more.
14772,10,"we like her ability to find our favorite music, even if it is a sample or older. our household loves this product!"
14773,3,"love it, she makes my life just a little easier"
14774,14,easy connection/setup process.  voice is clear.
14775,1,works great
14776,10,it needs to be able to learn new things!!!!
14777,5,was bought as gift and found out it was a great present. we love it!!
14778,9,we love alexa so much our children and grandchildren received one of the many echo devices this year.
14779,10,like having a person to talk to enjoy very much.

14783,9,love this speaker! we have three and connect them all throughout the house!
14784,1,"we love alexa, very useful and the sound quality was surprisingly excellent"
14785,14,sound and capabilities.where i have had to place due to being able to be plugged in
14786,9,everything
14787,11,like it is versatility. a lot of music. a little too much bass. not able to adjust bass or treble.
14788,10,i received it for christmas. every day i try to learn something new. fun. read the email and try.
14789,10,i bought this for my mom and she loves it. the sound is great and alexa has a good sense of humor
14790,10,"i love it, use it at my house. this thing almost does everything and provides great entertainment"
14791,14,works intermittent.  turns off on its own and the power needs to be unplugged to reset.
14792,9,i love it! with alexa i never feel like i¡¯m alone! it was the best gift i could have received!!!
14793,3,incredible how well it understands.
14794,10,i thought i would be able to have alexa play more music!
14795,9,"we love it, the grandkids have so much fun with her telling them jokes..."
14796,14,echo has a problem connecting with audible
14797,8,love it!
14798,10,i just do not feel like it gives me much of a benefit?  it is basically a kitchen timer that plays music.
14799,0,i like the sound quality the most but i do not like that i<u+fe0f>t has to stay plugged in to an outlet to work
14800,0,i know i should do more with it...but right now it plays the best music ever....i have been tur ed down just o ce
14801,5,my wife loves echo

14820,1,very good for playing music or just everyday questions. rich bass and suprisingly good at detecting your voice.

14871,10,"connected throughout the house..plays music,answers questions helps kids with homework,she is part of our family.."
14872,0,sounds good

14874,10,"this alexa is awesome!!!! i have 3 of them in my house, the sound while playing music is beyond my expectations,"
14875,10,alexa keeps me fresh on information daily. i appreciate her...

14959,12,amo a alexa
14960,14,so i have been wanting one of these for a long long time. i am constantly googling questions i thought this would be handy to have. not being technologically savvy.... it was not all that easy to set up. when u ask alexa a question....she mainly pulls info from wikipedia which is not necessarily a reliable source of information. in asking her questions at least half the time she does not understand....i ask the same thing in my samsung phone and it gives an answer. i ask to play a station i clearly have on my pandora....she asks if i want to add a station. asking it to play a song....sometimes it does....sometimes not. ask it to tell u a joke....they are knock knock jokes or about chickens crossing a road. juvenile.  not the piece of technology i anticipated. giving it 2 stars....the sound quality is good.....plays my pandora on command. (some stations anyway)
14961,9,great device and sound. have three young boys in the house and we all enjoy interacting with the echo.
14962,7,i really like this it is so enjoyable.<f0><u+009f><u+0092><u+0083><f0><u+009f><u+008f><u+00be><f0><u+009f><u+0092><u+0083><f0><u+009f><u+008f><u+00be><f0><u+009f><u+0092><u+0083><f0><u+009f><u+008f><u+00be><f0><u+009f><u+0092><u+0083><f0><u+009f><u+008f><u+00be>
14963,8,love it !!
14964,10,interesting  to play with. good info. getting ready to purchase light bulbs to hook up to system
14965,0,i like that it is hand free .wish is had better instructions very poor on how to use what it can do
14966,11,"i loved the 1st generation, but this one is even better."
14967,0,it understands most of the time on the first try without your need to repeat!
14968,14,awesome product
14969,8,simply amazing!
14970,14,"works as advertised and sounds great. one of the easiest electronics to install with bluetooth, pandora etc."
14971,0,"sounds great, i do not have to yell at her, the voice is relaxing, i love it it is great all the way around."
14972,10,our family enjoys alexa. we listen to music daily and ask her questions.
14973,12,i think i just need to learn how to use it better but alright  i like it
14974,12,this thing is awesome! just been listening to music so far.
14975,9,amazing i use it every day for multiple purpose my favorite purchase of the year
14976,0,"it is great but use to ask it to play music, now you have to sign up and pay money after 30 day free trial.."
14977,9,"love it and so does my husband.  he says if something happens to me, he will marry alexa."
14978,12,it is learning how to work her
14979,2,far exceeded my expectations.
14980,0,takes a while if your not computer savvy to figure it out.
14981,14,iheart radio station connections and game of throne quotes
14982,5,love it!!!
14983,11,the size..
14984,8,love it!!!

14998,0,"amazing,it is music with the knowledge of google,whats not to like,"
14999,9,my husband can get answers to his questions without asking me.  he is not computer savvy.
15000,0,i love how you you ask her questions and she can answer most of them. i promise you will love it.
15001,0,sound quality is very good.  my only issue is that sometimes alexa has trouble understanding me
15002,14,followed instructions and was never able to hook it up. tried 50 times. had others try. useless
15003,14,the ability to select the music i want is great. the sound is still not as good as google home.
15004,10,impressive sound. looks good on shelf. and kids think she tells better jokes than their father.
15005,7,i find my self repeating a command/question more than 4 times ... eventually i will give it a rest lol..<f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+00a4><f0><u+009f><u+00a4><u+00a8><f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+00a0>

15016,14,"the bogus bass is disgustingly bad. apparently after complaints by idiots that complained bass was not loud enough...read jacked up midbass crap sound, they hired some company like bose or beats to completely screw it up. so unlistenable i bought the hockey puck version with zero bass and crap sound but no bogus jacked up midbass so i could listen like a crappy clock radio sound but no garbage ""bass"" like a damn ghetto blaster. sucks. sucks big time. give us an app to adjust that bogus bass down."

15031,4,great sound quality and simple set up!! love it
15032,3,yes i absolutely love the echo it does so much more then i thought it could
15033,11,i like the way it picks up your voice.the size and the cover i wish you could put bass in it.
15034,12,excellent assistant! i have been enjoying it and discovering new things .it is fun and useful.
15035,10,love it want another one kids love it i want another one please send me a free one lol hahaha
15036,3,works as described
15037,12,i have enjoyed the echo. i highly recommend it.
15038,1,i love this!  the sound quality is excellent and i would highly recommend this to anyone
15039,11,works and sounds great..havent been able to find a batterie for it as of now like the one for the original echo
15040,1,it works fine
15041,11,"very nice,  love the smaller design and that charcoal color.  love it"
15042,10,we just love someone to play our music. answer our questions. entertain us
15043,1,"love it, great sound quality"
15044,10,i love the convenience of alexia for her vast knowledge and fun facts.  she is my virtual roommate.
15045,10,"great sound! gear for daily weather report, music, & trivia!"
15046,14,"i am very unimpressed with this thing.  i bought this for my wife for her birthday.  we already have an echo show and i am very impressed with that device.  we will primarily use this one as a music device, which was why i purchased this one.  it advertised ""improved sound"" and that was my deciding factor.  as far as a bluetooth speaker goes, this thing would hardly be worth $30.  i have a $40 jamtouch from 2015 that sounds much better than this thing.  the echo show has fantastic sound, so i assumed this one would be pretty good too.  as far as other features go, setup was easy.  voice recognition is spot on like the app and my other device, but that is software related.my wife says she likes it, so we are going to keep it... but if i had bought it for myself, it would be going back for sure."
15047,2,met all expectations
15048,1,"great product, the quality of the sound is wonderful..."
15049,3,not as good as i expected.
15050,8,i love it!  no complaints!
15051,14,i love everything about this product specially when she wakes me every morning at 4:00 like clock work
15052,0,what i like most is it looks nice.what i like least is she is not as smart as she thinks she is.
15053,0,absolutely love it.  especially the music.  there is very little that has not been able to be played on it.
15054,10,"no problems, learning how to use it, plays my country music and set alarms on it"
15055,0,what fun and a real friend
15056,7,i<u+fe0f>love the new echo
15057,1,a+++ great service
15058,1,the sound is perfection ............love the music the collection
15059,11,the sound is great and it fit in perfectly with our other to dots
15060,14,i am so impressed with the sound quality and volume of my new echo. i just wish i understood more how it works.
15061,10,"alexa program is fun and informative, its a lot of fun for our grandchildren also using the echo"
15062,10,very happy with this purchase. i love that i can listen to any type of music by voice command.
15063,14,love that it plays games and can hear me without yelling. wish it worked smoother with spotify
15064,10,"connecting with family in an emergency situation, wake up call, and really like the reminder setup"
15065,14,"it is a toy.  a nice looking one but a toy nonetheless.  the only thing i wanted it for was to stream music...  free music.  my local classical station is the hd2 of the local npr station in miami.  91.3 hd2.  alexa does not understand and only can play the hd1 station.  one thing i asked it to do and it can not.  if i had little kids maybe they would enjoy it but it is really disappointing.  gave it 3 stars for appearance and ease of setup.  also..  tried with great frustration.. to play local itunes library.  not.  tried to use plex to integrate the echo with my itunes library and plex just does not work in my scenario.  in fact, its a mess.  update..  it does not seem to work with iphones as a bluetooth speaker despite being billed as one.  iphone does not see it.  it really wants you to pay for a streaming subscription service(s).  bs."
15066,0,love this but wish it did not have to be plugged in all the time.
15067,14,like my new echo 2nd generation my big complete is can not get my local school closing for bad weather or etc
15068,1,very versatile.....practice makes perfect with alexa
15069,9,i am glad i bought them
15070,10,with combination of amazon music it keeps us entertained. my granddaughter loves it.
15071,9,got this for myself for an early christmas gift. and i love it! great sound. even my son loves alexa!!
15072,0,constantly turning off when asked to do something. alexa also does not pick up on what we say
15073,10,"i enjoy so much being able too check my spelling, i really have not found anything i dislike."
15074,14,"i like the echo, wish there were better instructions regarding using and setting up with a iphone hotspot"
15075,12,"still figuring out everything that alexa does, but it sure is fun finding out."
15076,12,thank you

15087,4,very handy device!
15088,1,it is actually a very useful and the sound is very good for such a small thing.
15089,14,"every time i use my tablet it turns of alexa, even after i uninstalled the app"
15090,11,love this. smaller size is great and sound quality is wonderful. love the design of the exterior (gray fabric)
15091,14,echo malfunctions on all basic commands. not worth the price
15092,3,i love this! i do not know how i ever managed without it!
15093,8,"awesome product, love it !!"

15112,10,we love alexa very cool...came on time and packaged perfect.
15113,14,worked beautifully!!
15114,10,love this alexa. so much easier to put music and turn on lights when you cant use your hands.
15115,9,"i love my new friend, alexa!she is so smart and make me happy with her jokes and songs!"
15116,12,love it! just gotta know the tricks and she works like a charm.
15117,10,i love my echo for listening to music. great sound quality.
15118,14,"until this came out we had an echo and a dot in our home, and we loved the echo tower for its amazing sound, and thought the dot was serviceable, but the sound was terrible. now that we have the this 2nd generation and it is an amazing mid-level option, we will likely invest in these for places like the kids' bedrooms, the bathroom, etc.the sound is far superior to the dot.  it has many different finishes to choose from to compliment any decor style, and its size makes it great for filling smaller rooms with full sound. i would not necessarily choose this for a large room as the speakers are not as powerful as the larger echo tower, but if it is the one that fits your budget and you can restrain yourself from ""turning it up to eleven"" (as they say...it only goes up to ten) and risk blowing the speaker, then go for it--you will not regret it.the one thing i have to say, is that they did take away the ring on the top from the echo tower by which you can manually turn the ring to adjust down the volume, and we all kind of miss that on this one. aside from that, though, we absolutely love this!"
15119,14,one minute she gives the answer to a question but then when asked again doesnt.
15120,11,very pleased with my echo 2nd. generation.
15121,9,love my echo !!! get one !!!

15127,2,espectacular
15128,11,great quality sound for less than $100. easy setup.
15129,3,"i love my alexa! great sound, i would buy it again!"
15130,5,we made it a gift to a 90 year old friend.  she was thrilled and considers alexa to be hew new best friend.

15138,10,"alexa is the best. i can hear exactly what i want hear, no searching for a cd or play list!"
15139,14,"great sound for a great price...sounds like a commercial, but seriously, i have no regrets."
15140,5,this was given as a gift to my son and i am certain that he liked it!
15141,10,"enjoy the ease you can get information e.g. news briefing, music, etc"
15142,11,the sound is much better than i expected.

15160,10,"love our echo... we ask her the weather, recipes, add things to our grocery list and best of all...music."
15161,0,"really do not have anything bad to say about it, we like it!!"
15162,1,great room filling sound

15172,4,it is easy to use and was easy to set up
15173,11,works great but i miss the turning head volume adjustment
15174,0,alexa does not listen to commands at time.  randomly the volume will go full blast or completely freeze up
15175,9,they work wonderfully and my wife thinks they are so easy to communicate with.

15189,12,gret tool. having fun finding new things she can do
15190,14,this echo is so sweet!! the sound on this puppy is great and alexa is about three times as smart as siri. great device

15192,11,i love my echo! the color and quality of sound is awesome.?like it much better than the dot.
15193,10,fantastic product!! great for hands free discussions and for the kids!!
15194,0,it does not work well for me. it continues to say ¡°i do not understand ¡° every time i ask a question.
15195,11,can i bluetooth with a wireless speaker in another part of the house? do like the echo
15196,11,"vastly improved sound from the echo dot,and i can not think of a downside !"

15200,1,i use it daily and would recommend to anyone. i like the quality of the speaker. music sounds great on it.
15201,10,loved how easy it was to set up.  it is great to put together a playlist.  husband and i use it every day.
15202,0,did not realize that echo had to remain plugged in.i have a slight accent cannot get her to understand me.
15203,14,another option to cable tv......this makes it easier to cut the cable.
15204,1,alexa is great
15205,1,i love the echo. great sound
15206,1,"great music, and information"
15207,4,"big sounds in little packages, the sounds are awesome and exceded my expectations."

15209,1,"works very well , sound is very good,wood buy again."
15210,10,"speakers, are great, clear."
15211,11,works as stated
15212,3,very neat to have it around. i use it for a lot more than i thought i would!
15213,10,great music
15214,10,"love love love !!! super helpful in the kitchen , and music is on all the time !"
15215,1,fantastic
15216,0,"not as smart as the google version, can not even get it to play acdc"
15217,12,i use it all he time! it is very convenient and can do many things. definitely a helpful product.
15218,1,oh my god its so amazing! i love it!
15219,10,i love shuffling my favorite artists
15220,9,love the sound on this little thing!
15221,10,alexa is my buddy....  say alexa good morning and she calls you beautiful
15222,1,good sound quality and alexa service is a great resource.
15223,14,"let me say first that i love amazon, i have for many years.  unfortunately, this product is just a failure in so many ways for me.  i primarily got it because i wanted to play music in multiple rooms via voice commands.  it is here where the echo is awful for no rational reason.  so when i ask alexa to play a song, she repeats the song title correctly and then says - and wait for it - it is not in my library, but there it is. i can ask siri to play it, and she gets it every time.  i do not know if this is an apple versus amazon issue, but i tried no less than a dozen songs, and alexa repeats them, but says she can not find them in my library.  i am connected via wifi and bluetooth, but is makes no difference.  i even tried to play songs by artist...same problem.  again, siri works.  i was hoping for a nice speaker solution with echo with some of abilities of siri, but it does not work.  now if you are looking for an amazon centric product and keep your music on the cloud (obviously via amazon), or use a lot of music based apps like spotify, iheart, etc, this could be for you.  however, if you have purchased music that you want to play from your phone... it just does not work."
15224,10,"best xmas gift ever for my wife. she loves it and uses it for everything, music, phone calls, lists etc."
15225,14,"what i like most is the echo to echo (drop in feature)  keeps family closer, we are in different states."
15226,0,i like the fast results. i do not like the fact that certain music search and questions can not be answered
15227,3,worked  great  did everything you asked it to do ooo
15228,9,great
15229,11,sound i liked.  nothing bad
15230,14,"we have a generation 1 echo and a few generation 1 dots, and have not had any problems with them. i decided to get one more as a christmas gift for my husband so we could have intercoms/speakers in all the major rooms of the house. i also thought it would be cool to see how the 2nd generation had improved upon the first, but this one is way worse! i mainly use it to play music during the day and white noise at night, but that apparently is too much for the 2nd generation echo to handle. it could not switch between playing spotify to another command like playing white noise--just did not do anything or would start playing the music (that had already been stopped) again. we chatted with customer support and they recommended restarting it, but i would have to restart every time i stopped playing music for it to follow commands correctly. it also started skipping while playing music periodically. i would even disconnect and start playing straight from my phone to make sure it was not a wifi problem but sure enough, just a problem with the echo. returning for a refund."
15231,9,i am enjoying my echo and have no complaints.
15232,10,i absolutely love it! so much easier to play music and figure out the weather for the day!
15233,1,the sound is very good.
15234,4,easy to set up and get startedkeeps looking set up and have to do over
15235,10,"this a great machine,  i live alone and echo gives me a lot of entertainment"
15236,3,i got as a gift. did not know what one was but i love it now that i have one.
15237,8,love it  !!
15238,0,"it really is a neat thing,  alexa does not always answer all my questions.  i give her a black mark for that"
15239,14,love my echo....we have 2 in the house & have synced them.
15240,14,setup was difficult and not being an amazon custom is worse. google is more friendly for those w/o amazon.
15241,9,we own two amazon echos and my wife is preference is for the new model.
15242,0,am enjoying this device!  still becoming accustomed to simple language but enjoying music!  great sound!
15243,10,great buy!  the sound system is wonderful when listening to music.  answers the majority of my questions
15244,0,sound is very good. i am disappointed in answers. i get referred to other aps instead of direct answers?
15245,5,it was a gift for my millennial son and he loves it!
15246,9,love it and people that hear alexa are very impressed. best purchase i have made in a long time!
15247,10,the echo is great. love the flash briefing everyday. i have no complaints yet
15248,10,love the new echo.  alexa has been playing all the christmas favorites!
15249,1,"best gift ever, sound quality is awesome"
15250,1,very convenient very informative lots of fun really enjoyed it
15251,14,i would like to see an update where it could use the voice feature of different characters.
15252,10,alexa is a great babysitter for my one-year-old grandson. she knows all the nursery rhymes.
15253,14,best online tool and experience  recommend language learning basics and translation for home users.
15254,11,"totally happy with the purchase and happier with the price..good deal, happy customer!"
15255,10,love it can not say enough about it sound is great and fun to have her in the house
15256,8,great!  love it
15257,11,i like it but was hoping for a better sound.  but it does a great job and would tell anyone to buy it
15258,8,i love alexa.
15259,1,we love the options thast the app provides. it is fun and handy!!
15260,11,not sure what people were complaining about but the sound quality of this was great.  no complaints here.
15261,0,i love it but would like to have some ideas on how to use it.
15262,2,met and exceeded expectations. amazing.
15263,3,i love it. better than i expected. sound is great
15264,9,i love it. i run my entire house of of it
15265,14,it suits my needs as casual source of entertainment.
15266,0,"i love alexa, she is smart and helpful at all times."
15267,0,the sound is good. it does not seem to know much. most questions i ask it does not know.
15268,2,love everything about echo!
15269,0,it is pretty cool that you can ask some questions and get answers and play music.
15270,11,sound for such a small device better than expected.
15271,14,"people... this is a very good product! it is sound is very good, especially after the recent update. it is a hundred bucks now, $80 less than before! any $100 speaker is going to have sound in the ballpark of the echo and it is got all of alexa is smart skills built in. for news, podcasts, pandora in my office, it is great. if i want better sound, i will use another option to stream to or plug in to. not sure what you¡¯re expecting for such a low price. to me, echo is a bargain."
15272,12,i still have not found all of the great things i can do with it yet
15273,1,quality product
15274,11,great sound. microphones seems to pick-up way better than my echo plus.
15275,10,i love it...my kids love it too! asking it to tell them a story or play their favorite songs!
15276,1,great product
15277,10,love the vast array of songs and so easy to use. love cruising the oldies.
15278,12,"sound is good . still learning how to pare it to other components , i know i will like it a lot"
15279,0,i love everything alexa does for me
15280,3,works well.  sound could be better.
15281,14,alexa is the only woman in my life who will listen to me and follow through on my requests.
15282,8,love it
15283,4,great product.setup was a headache though!
15284,1,the sound quality is excellent. it also has a more wide range of topics. this product is a lot of fun!!
15285,8,completely love this thing!
15286,0,it is a great thing to have.  i wonder what i did without it!  i am very pleased!
15287,14,piece of junk.  trouble connecting.  trouble editing.  waste of time

15461,8,i love this thing
15462,1,love the echo!!!  great technology!
15463,14,"all in all i am happy with echo but it seems to drop internet connection too frequently.  the dreaded not connected message from the app and alexa is maddening, top be honest.  i find i have to manually enter the router credentials at least 2 times a week as well as reboot echo by unplugging and plugging back in.also, there is very limited streaming of siriusxm on this device.  it does not play many of the stations i can play on various other streaming devices and alexa just tells me that my account will not allow that station which i know is not true.an additional gripe is you are limited to music you can play.  i am already an amazon prime member and have some music through that, but having to pay for amazon music to expand the library is pretty disappointing."
15464,1,voice is clear.  we enjoy alexa very much
15465,1,echo works great and is very interactive!
15466,12,met all my expectations and more. i would definitely recommend this product to anyone.
15467,0,i like that there are always new things she knows how to do! the sound is awesome too!
15468,14,"while the sound is considerably better than the 1st gen echo, its performance leaves a lot to be desired. i enjoy listening to ambient sounds, and have no issues with the 1st gen. but with this one, it ignores my requests 98% of the time. i tried disabling and re-enabling the skill, which seemed to fix the problem initially. however, it was not long before it went back to ignoring me. i¡¯m considering returning it, and getting another 1st gen. i¡¯d rather have a device with lesser sound quality than an expensive paperweight."
15469,12,"it is ok, not that great"
15470,0,i like all the capabilities!it often has trouble finding the wifi.
15471,1,great sound quality
15472,14,"i like the ease of it. it connected easily and seems to work great, unless our wifi is down."

15487,10,it listened to me and tell me everything  i want to know about current events around the world.
15488,14,echo 2nd generation is flat out exceptional by every definition of the word..no problem whatsoever.
15489,0,"great device, but does seem to be limited a bit as an information resource."

15500,5,i purchased as a valentine day gift for my husband and his reaction was one huge smile!

15701,14,i works good expect i can not get them to talk to other echoes like a intercom
15702,14,"being an early adaptor, i ordered this smart looking echo to supplement my amazon echo family of four! now i am a parent of five all ears listening echo is! while all four are excellent and without complaint, this one by far is superior in looks with its modest fabric coat, sound much improved with good base and certainly listening skills are improved. without doubt the earlier issues with microphone being not able to pick up commands when volume is turned out loud is somewhat addressed by a more powerful microphone array.its simply fabulous piece of technology.my next target is to wait for the echo connect device scheduled for launch on 13th december 2017. i hope and pray amazon will consider me to have access to the device  early so i may review on it as i feel this technology will put behind rest of the smart devices for a pretty long period.good work jeff and the echo team!"

15810,0,doesnt do much. takes too specific language to get it do do things.
15811,3,it is just as i expected and worked quite well on the echo.
15812,8,we love it.
15813,10,playing music and asking questions.
15814,14,"i original gave this item 5 stars but after the the multitude of issues i have had with this device and the other associated echo and dot devices that i have. i have constant issues with the players just stopping or dropping audio, i have a total of 4 devices (2 dots 2 echos) grouped together that i often play together in a group labeled ""everywhere"" well one of the 4 players will just up and stop playing, if i use the alexa app to look at that individual player it says it is playing in the everywhere group but i get no control over that one device. i have cycled power on the units and they are up to date for software/firmware versions. this is simply unacceptable, unstable and very flaky. i should not have to stop doing what i am doing to tend to a trivial matter such as this, but the devil is in the details and this particular detail is not easily overlooked."
15815,12,so far like everything about it. just learning it is potential.
15816,10,i really enjoy the voice activation- very convenient when i¡¯m doing praise and worship
15817,9,got them for my three adult children.  they love the echo
15818,10,i like everything about you can adk her almost anything and she will try to help love the music
15819,11,good sound quality that fills the room. a few problems with it understanding my english accent!
15820,14,i need to figure out how to set up my second speaker?
15821,9,i bought it for my husband at christmas and he is really enjoying it and all the features.
15822,12,i love alexa!  just a fun toy to have around!

15825,3,"easy to setup,and it works just like it should."
15826,4,fun to use. work great
15827,4,not user friendly. difficult to setup. amazon app constantly crashes lots of bugs.
15828,10,love the reminders and alarms.  finding new ways to make my life earlier everyday.
15829,11,the music sound is not that great but coming from a small device it is acceptable.

16386,1,absolutely pleased with this product and amazon prime with service.
16387,0,mine seems to have some kinda problem where it can not hear me when i¡¯m quiet :(
16388,14,"i owned the original echo and loved it. however, purchased the 2nd generation when a mechanical failure resulted in my having to return it for a replacement. i chose the 2nd gen because it was supposed to be a better quality sound than the original. however, i have found the sound is actually downgraded from the 1st gen. while it still sounds nice, it is most certainly not an improvement.i have also discovered that alexa seems to hear me clearly on an intermittent basis. it seems at least a couple times per day, i have to repeat my commands to alexa before she responds correctly.  this was never an issue on the 1st gen unit.i have also discovered that the echo has occasional problems switching between skills. i may listen to a radio program skill, stop it, then tell alexa to switch to a sleep sound skill. however, it will start up the radio skill again. i will have to repeat this several times, or disconnect/reconnect the echo to get out of the loop. i never encountered this on my 1st gen unit.generally, the 2nd gen echo is a decent device and is very useful.  however, it has several bugs and is not an improvement over the original."

16399,5,my family loves it!!
16400,1,very good product. love it
16401,11,"just got my new echo second generation to upgrade my echo first generation. easy set up and it automatically downloaded the latest software updates. the sound is amazing, big improvement over the original echo. rich deep bass and it fills the room with strong stereo sound. the original echo was good, but this is great. well worth the upgrade investment. i read the reviews and i assume amazon addressed the sound complaints with their updates. no problem now as far as i am concerned."

16708,13,awesome!!!
16709,14,"buyer beware! one of the really good reasons to purchase an amazon echo was that if you so chose, you could upload up to 250 songs from your personal music library to create various playlists.  as recently as this past christmas amazon even ran tv commercials eluding to such.  personal music is anything you have previously owned on cd that you may or may not have purchased directly from amazon.  amazon has ended this practice.  from this point on, if you want to listen to any music through alexa you must subscribe to amazon music.  an added expense for a service amazon touted as ""free"" at the time these echos were purchased.  amazon limited you to 250 personal songs that could be played for free.  google home let is you add as many as you want from your personal library, all for free."
16710,8,love this thing!

17169,14,"my mom is echo dot was sometimes frustrating to use, so i got her this as a replacement for christmas. the sound is about on par with the previous generation echo (i own that one) but it is abolity to understand you is greatly improved! no more trying to shout over the music and washing machine. the echo dot is not obselete though; that is just been moved to a less-used room. fully satisfied with the purchase.also, i would like to note that the shell of the device is changable, in case something happens to damage it, it gets old and dirty, or you just want to change things up. i did not realize that before purchasing, which is funny since i am usually very observant about what i buy. this feature makes cleaning the echo less scary, you can just take off the outer shell and clean it if needed, rather than risking pushing dust further into it."
17170,1,"sound is great, device is great looking, and alexa is awesome!"
17171,10,alexa can hear from the next room and my kids love it! entertaining and fun.

17700,14,"works similar to the 1st generation echo, but the reduced price is fabulous. i did not do intensive research on this product before hand so i was quite surprised to see that the fabric cover could be removed and replaced. the sound is slightly improved from the 1st gen, and it seems to have increments for adjusting the volume by hand. i have not been able to do it by voice command.personally, i find that the focus on the bass is really annoying at times. i considered reducing the review by a star for that and the inability to change the settings for the bass, midrange, and treble, but that is my preference. so, as far as the echo 2nd generation goes, it does very well for what it is intended to do."

18194,14,"i had the gen1 for a few days and did not like it.  the price was the biggest issue honestly.  however, i found i really did not ""use"" it.  my life has changed, as my girlfriend has one, so i like the ""drop in"" feature to sort of be ""together"" without being in the same room.  the ""call quality"" is not great as it is not full-duplex (meaning when you talk, the speaker gets much softer), so you have to take turns speaking.  i tend to interrupt, so perhaps it is teaching me a valuable skill :).on the topic of valuable skills, be sure to say ""alexa... for a fart"".  yep, i am a grown man, but my inner child still loves it."
18195,9,it is 4 a friend of mine who is blind.  he loves it!!!
18196,14,"so far, i love it! now just let me add music/audio to routines and i will be in heaven! or will i be in heaven by the time you add it?update: i do not know what it is, but this new one can barely understand me, whereas my dot has no trouble at all. super simple things like ""tell sleep sounds to play ocean"" now results in the damn radio playing npr. driving me crazy, so i just stopped using it at all. waste of money."

18738,14,"amazon has been coming out with tons of alexa products. i like this as a great fit between the echo dot ($29) and echo ($149) for use in a bedroom. the echo dot has horrible audio quality, but has a headphone jack to connect external speakers. the echo ($149) is too large and too expensive for a bedroom. i currently have an echo ($149) in the kitchen which has great audio to reach the living room. alexa vs google home - they are very competitive products. alexa is great for music as the audio quality is great, however, alexa ai is not great. google home is better for smart home and ai experience, however the audio on google home is not the best."

18887,14,"this was a christmas present. idea was that i  can just tell alexa to play music, ask questions, keep up with  the news, etc. and i kinda of can but only somewhat. even with amazon is  4 bucks a month music subscriptions, alexa can only play some of the music i am interested in. for instance, holly near yes but her powerful political albums from the early 70s nada  or beethoven is 9th maybe if i could name an orchestra and conductor otherwise you get a badly truncated snippet.  i can get the npr headlines but not  morning edition, all things considered, etc.i can set a timer and it works every time nice and audible but if i set a wake-up alarm it almost always goes off at the lowest volume.  sometimes i hear it on time but if i am in a deep cycle it might take twenty or more minutes to pick up the faint alarm sound. i went into my  alexa  app on my smartphone once and set the alarm volume loud enough to wake me. i was successful and for one time it was loud enough but the next day right back to the lowest volume. while trying to listen to fresh air the show kept getting stopped because alexa kept disconnecting and reconnecting to my computer (which was not how i pulled up fresh  air,  alexa was able to get this show on her own) .the only way to stop this dysfunction was to turn off my computer is  bluetooth. so much for convenience.i enjoy what it can do, such as tell me the weather, the headlines, play lots of mainstream music, spell words  i am  uncertain about etc. but there is much to be improved with this a i!"

18983,14,"i bought 2 for my kids. so far it does what they were intended for: music, random facts and to call us when we are gone. my only complaint is that we can not stream 2 different songs on both devices at the same time from spotify. this is a waste of our premium upgrade. amazon is solution is to buy their music subscription which allows multi-device use, but that is not a solution. we do not use amazon music and have no library built there plus their selection is smaller than spotify.i called spotify and they have no multi-device option at this time. so,my only work around was to create a pandora account and one kid uses that and the other uses spotify. i still feel like i am wasting money on the spotify upgrade because i can link pandora for free. we will see how it goes. hopefully one of them will come up with a ""family plan"" soon."

19168,14,"what a great product if you have a bunch of adults living in your house. if you have kids, not so much! bought four dots and one echo. what a nightmare it has been trying to find a way that my 11 and 9 year old is can use there own spotify accounts to play music on their individual dots. voice recognition is great if you have an amazon account but if you do not, no way to differentiate who you are. once again can not recognize the kids even though they are on my amazon household. can not use the app to designate different default music providers for differed units in the same house. real headache. there are very simple solutions to these problems but amazon is in no hurry because they already sold ten million of these. sad."

19176,11,"extremely dissappointed. the sound quality is horrible, which is even more disappointing after all of the advertising around improved sound quality.  the sound is much worse than my echo gen 1.  the dot almost sounds better.  i have no expectations the echo 2 will sound like a fully functional surround sound system or something similar, but it is very bad for what it is (and compared to the prior echo 1).  i read a review mentioning a software update that helps with the sound quality, but i have yet to see an update or improvement.  i am considering returning this unit."

19260,10,great and wonderful source of music by everyone.
19261,14,"seems like most reviewers mainly care about the sound. the most common response you will get from alexa is ""sorry, i do not know that"". alexa can not answer simple questions that my google assistant can on my phone. it is good for playing music and calendar reminders. will not pair with my hue lights no matter what i do.  i originally gave the echo 2 stars but i am dropping it to one star do to amazon discontinuing their music upload service. the main reason for the echo was so i could listen to my personal music collection as well as music purchased through amazon. i will be returning it."

19380,2,we love our echo!
19381,8,great item
19382,14,"the echo was given to me as a present and i¡¯m not enthralled by it like the gift giver. i have found many questions i asked are answered by a i do not know response.  i realized when asking a question the question has to be superficial and to expect a similar answer. it can play music and npr, but i already have a device that does that. as far as ordering products through it, i would never use that feature. i also do not see myself spending money to turn my house into a smart house any time soon or in the future. so all in all my echo spends most of its time unplugged and forgotten, i¡¯m not ready to interact with a digital assistant at this time in my life and i do find it disturbing all the stories coming out now about the device listening in on us. i guess i¡¯m not ready to sacrifice my privacy for so little in return."
19383,14,easy to setting up another echo.
19384,10,like all of it.
19385,14,"i might change this review later. this is my first echo and my first bluetooth speaker. i bought this primarily so my daughter could say ""alexa play taylor swift"" and i do not have to dig out a playlist for her and it fills my small house. i set it up on halloween when it arrived. and yes, the first thing my daughter did was say; ""alexa play taylor swift"" and immediately my house filled up ts and candy. it was magic. the next day i headed down to the city for the night so noticed on my way out my alexa had multiple lights on. being the responsible denizen i am and not a power waster, i turned the alexa off and headed to nyc. so when i got back the next day i wanted to relive some electronica music and to my surprise, alexa would not turn on. i was like uhhh weird. i tried pressing the button again. nothing. i then got my phd online about ""how to reset alexa"" - all of which failed. i got a new power cord. nothing. i sat patiently online while the amazon technical gurus tried to fix this. my alexa is dead. one night. and dead. so yes, amazon is sending me another one. they are being very nice about it. but i am nervous as hell. i mean what product works literally one night and then never turns on again? that is like the worst electronics product ever. or the worst date. or something. so right now, amazon is customer service is great. maybe its a fluke. or maybe it is just a crap product design that is designed to fail. we live in a society where too much of this is a disposable. ""alexa, fix this."" rant. over."
19386,3,works great
19387,8,love it
19388,12,love it! very helpful in so many ways.
19389,8,i enjoy it

19463,0,ease of use- limited play options
19464,14,"terrible sound quality.  extremely disappointed based on how it is advertised.  decided to go with the echo plus instead, since they do not make the original, and reviews seem to indicate the sound quality is about equal to the original.  i have wanted to get a speaker for every room now that you can sync music through them- and with the form factor of the 2nd gen echo, i thought this would fit in great.  total let down.  they went from being a leader with a great product, to bungling the whole thing up."

19779,3,"great sound, has done everything as advertised"
19780,14,"so sad, this is so not a ""next gen"" product. it is cheaper than the old echo and is **improved**, but no way does it sound better. even with the 2420 firmware. it is a sad comparison to the sounds from the echo show, for that matter. the big worry is that when the apple homepod arrives next month, the echoes are going to be worthless scrap. i have so much invested in the echo-sphere; i want a better-sounding echo now!here is the deal:1. i want  to be able to couple two echoes for a stereo effect. cmon, not that hard. i can do ""groups"" across my home, why not a simple l+r speaker effect. the sonos 1:s that i have do this very well.2. i want an excellent ""echo-endorsed"" paid of external speakers that can make the new echo and the dot competitive.3. what happened to alexa is voice? she sounds at times like she is being strangled. poor thing! with that, where is the male voice? seriously, even the crappy siri is better than alexa, that is really pretty low.4. drop the entire line of echoes and make the echo show more affordable. who needs a crappy-sounding speaker for $100 when the show could be affordable and entertaining.5. stop selling this new echo line. it sucks and you know it.this is unacceptable. do better, amazon. please do not render the echoes crappy just because you want to expand the alexa-universe. making a decent speaker is not hard. making a stereo pair is not that hard. making alexa a little more clever and responsive is not that hard. this new direction makes me sad."
19781,8,awesome product
19782,8,love alexa!

19814,5,it was a gift to my son and he love it
19815,14,absolutely worthless to me. i thought that it would be a fun and useful tool to have but it was a total waste of 100 bucks. my phone and watch tell me the time and temp and my remote can change channels faster and easier. this will not even find the channel guide on dish. it can not turn my tv off and on even though it is a smart tv hooked to the internet too. i do not have smart lights or thermostats and if i am gone and there is a power outage who will reconnect the units?? so i wasted money buying alexa it serves me little.
19816,1,"excellent speaker, good sound for music."

19888,14,"owned a 2nd generation echo dot for 2 days...would not stay connected.  i took it back and upgraded to the 2nd generation echo.  have owned the 2nd generation echo for 3 days.  i wanted to love it but it just is not worth the effort and cost.sometimes it works but most of the time, it does not.  it cuts off as i am making a request.  i have unplugged it, rebooted it, called customer service, but nothing works.  it just will not stay connected.  customer service says ""it is learning"".  how can you learn or interact if the device will not stay connected?i have searched the reviews and most complaints are about the sound quality.  i wish i was that lucky.  my recommendation is to put your money away and wait for the bugs to be worked out.  i have 3 more coming that i  purchased for christmas presents.  as soon as they arrive, everything is being returned.  amazon, you bombed big time on this product.  it was not ready for release."

20105,1,"love, love, love.  sound is awesome."
20106,14,"it is really not smart. in my apartment, which i share with my girlfriend, it is incredibly difficult to get the virtual assistant to behave jun the way we expect her to, or behave consistently between the two of us. the first obstacle was seeing up a household to link out accounts. she had been previously been a part of a different household, but in order for her to join mine, she needed to leave and then wait six months, 180 days, before i could invite her to link with my account. this was unacceptable, given that this would mean one of us could not use our music libraries, or set up our own skills. now that we have sorted that out, there is still no parity between the smart home devices i have set up in the alexa app and what she, and thus the echo, has set up. this has meant that i cannot control the ikea lights we have in the bedroom from my phone using the alexa app, but do work from the echo, and the smartthings lights that can be controlled from the alexa app on my phone, so not work when using the echo.the novelty of these virtual assistants is pretty neat, but the reliability of this one is just far enough off that it makes me want to throw the thing through the window more frequently than it provides any appeal."

20420,14,"the power cord did not work (we determined this by using with another cord). i spent tons of time trying to get non-english speaking folks in an overseas amazon call center to just ship me a new cord. instead, i was instructed to purchase a replacement cord in a non-amazon brand that would not arrive until jan 5th with a promotional credit. when i purchased that cord as instructed, my credit card was charged. i was not sent a promotional code to enter. i was told it would automatically be applied. it was not. this was a very disappointing purchase since it was a christmas gift. i am returning the entire item. amazon customer service used to be great years ago when we had issues with kindles. now, it is been contracted out to people who are incompetent and do not care."

20744,14,"the little bugs and quirks will drive you crazy.this was released before it was ready for general use.so many little and big problems, (bugs) that they have not worked out.give amazon about 2 months from 11.10.17 to work out all the issues before you buy.will be returning.11.10.17well,  back down to a 1 now. the following things happen or dont as compared to echo dot 2nd.1. stops in middle of playing a playlist arbitrarily about 4 out of 10 times.2. sound distorts past 4 or 5 vol.3. one of those wierd power adaptersactually i like everything about this better then previous echo.although the previous version was returned.this new november 2017 version seems to be better at recognizing my voice. (even with mid to 3/4 music vol.)the sound is also better in my opinion. this new one seems to project sound in 360 degree pattern better then the previous gen.dont think its louder, just better balanced all the way around.the echo remote worked great after an update. but before that only vol up/dn. but now all functionality.glad i didnt buy it when it first came our or i would have returned it.seems to be stable so far.... lets see....."

20781,14,"this is an attractive product in shape and size. the color i got, a grayish tweed, was very handsome.  we expected the sound to be better.  we are not audiophiles, but we do appreciate quality sound, as we listen to mostly jazz and classical music.  also, the song request process seemed to go astray.  we asked for music by carlos jobim, but after a couple songs by his band, we started getting covers of his music.  when i tried to correct this trend by restating the request, ""played by jobim,"" rather than ""by jobim,"" the offerings still evolved away from our request."

20807,14,"amazon claims that you can listen to spotify on multiple echo speakers at once, so i tried it.  you can, if you do not mind unplugging and rebooting all the echo is and dots several times a day!  it stops playing in the middle of a song and you can not restart the everywhere group without running around the house.  this technology is not ready for the market.  i guess they rushed it to compete with sonos, but instead they are just bugging us loyal amazon and spotify customers.  if you are a spotify listener, take a pass until you are sure amazon and spotify fix this major bug."

20915,14,"amazon clearly states that they have improved the sound of the speaker vs. 1 gen echo; not true. first gen echos were great speakers, and an amazing value for your money. i had several speakers below and above the first gen echo price point, and the echo is sound was better or almost like speakers 3x the cost. this 2nd gen echo speakers sound much worst and not sure the speaker individually is worth the price. frankly this a step back for echo products. buying the plus seems not to fix this issue since amazon also reduced the tweeter size in the plus:echo 1st gen: 2.5"" woofer and 2.0 inch tweeterecho 2nd gen: 2.5"" woofer and 0.6"" tweeterecho plus: 2.5"" woofer and 0.8"" tweeterwhat a shame."

20945,14,i purchased this as a christmas gift for my sister-in-law a few weeks ago. i also own an echo (1st generation) that i bought almost a year ago. i happened to go into settings in the alexa app on my iphone a couple of days ago and noticed something that i had not seen before:  a selection for a second echo (offline). i do not know if everyone now has this or if it was added because amazon thought i purchased this new echo for myself. it does not seem to cause any problems...i was just surprised to see this. at some point in the future i will purchase another echo for me.
20946,0,alexa is pretty dumb
20947,2,love my echo it is anazing

20954,2,i like everything!
20955,14,"i like the concept. i do prefer the first gen tho. i thought this having dolby would be better, but sadly it is not. the sound should be much better. for the price of $100 which is not bad, it should produce room filling sound. the first gen has much better sound. the alexa does work great tho. when ever the third gen comes out. they need to improve the sound to be much louder. also i would suggest it being portable. i have owned numerous bluetooth speakers which i have paid various amounts for. i have had much cheaper ones that produce a much better sound. this product has next to nothing as far as bass. imo they made this cheaper than the first gen. that is why it is only $99 compared to when the 1st was $150. do not be fooled but customer service saying this is a better product. they are just trying to sell it. as for the wifi on this it is not that great. i constantly loose connection. my modem/router is only 20ft away. i do like how you can connect this to another home or portable speaker to make it much louder, but why?  the reason why i gave it two stars instead of one is bc you can get it in various colors. so in closing do not be fooled. this claims to be dolby and it sure is not. there are much, much better speakers out there. there are ones that still use siri,alexa, and google(some with all 3) that have much better sound and are even portable. so this is just my review and i hope you take all this into consideration. one more thing. i know i do not have a  defective unit bc my girlfriend and a few friends all own same one and all have same issue."

21092,14,"let the buyer beware. i received a dot as a gift and my initial experience was good enough that i picked up an echo 2nd gen for the better speaker. in the past several weeks however, amazon has made several significant stealth nerfs on these devices. the have quietly shuttered their music upload service to new users so that you can not play music you¡¯ve purchased elsewhere such as itunes, they removed the voice training feature for some reason which i sorely miss since i need to make virtually every request twice, and most recently they removed the feature (at least in the ios) app which allows you to view and control playback of your music. to me this device is worth much less than when i purchased it a mere few weeks ago."

21141,14,"this product has a nice speaker that connects easily to bluetooth, but it is main theoretical appeal is to be a ""smart speaker"", able to answer questions, download podcasts, etc. the main issue for me is the lack of the ability to recognize different phrases meaning the same thing, so you need to not only say ""alexa"", but then be relatively precise with the wording of the request you provide. for instance, if you want to download a podcast, you have to say ""alexa"", then provide a phrase to activate a specific ""skill"" with a specific name (e.g., ""anypod""). then you have to ask for a specific podcast and maybe it will retrieve it. i am sure this will be fantastic in a year or two. but for now it is a decent bluetooth speaker that can tell you the weather."

21195,0,"love playing with alexa is functionality. a little disappointated in her lack of recall when asked questions. she has a bizarre intellect---knows things you would never expect her to know, but flubs on some of the easier google questions.  i have no doubt she will get better with time. it is like having a toddler in the house again---we have to spell out her name so that she does not realize we are talking to her!! we would buy again. we are learning along with her. we are enjoying having her turn on/off our lights and just began voice messaging our son in another city."

21263,14,"the first week it was pretty cool using the echo with two dots, being able to walk from one room to another and have the music continue on. unfortunately after a while, the echo began to show that it is not quite up to standards of futuristic hope. the echo would just begin to go silent, with it telling me that basically it could not work right then and to ""try later"". or it would go silent completely, after flashing like it was going to respond. i was getting all geared up to purchase all the accessories, then it let me know that it is basically an infant in electronics. i guess we have a few more decades to go before it is more than just a novelty."

21490,14,i trusted that amazon would put out another great echo so i bought 3.  the sound is not nearly as good as the 1st one.  i am sending them back for a refund.  very dissapointed.  amazon would save money by not selling these because of all the refunds.  if this is your first echo it might seem ok but it is not.  i bought these for xmas gifts.  i can not give them and tell them there is an upgrade to sound better..  i got a refund and why i trust amazon to do the right thing.  i hope the next product is better.
21491,10,pretty sweet
21492,14,"updated review 11/7/17wow!  the newest software update makes this thing rock!  the sound is amazing now, great job amazon!  i¡¯m only giving 4 stars since i really miss the volume knob on the top like the first gen has.  other than that, great job!<u+2014>original review<u+2014>after being hyped since my preorder, i was severely disappointed when i plugged it in and heard the sound, like many others have said.  i was expecting to be ¡°wowed¡± but it was just a let down.  this version does not have the volume knob on top which i really like on my 1st gen, i¡¯ll miss that a lot on this one.  once i receive the update, i¡¯ll update my review."

21499,4,:)
21500,14,"the echo is a cool gimmick and a decent amazon app speaker.notice i didnt call it a bluetooth or even a regular speaker. make no mistake, this product exists solely to keep you tied to all amazon peripherals.you cannot use this as a bluetooth speaker. you cannot use this as a wired speaker. you can only use this if it has a connection to wifi.it doesnt like to play well with anything non-amazon sponsored, and will often tell you to purchase xyz to do something.the amazon home system also fails to provide basic common sense abilities (like the lack of bluetooth speaker capabilities) when linking multiple echo devices together.i own an echo dot as well that i have setup in my bathroom. one would expect it to be easy to install and network with the echo but it was surprisingly difficult to properly integrate to work with the echo.after getting them set up i figures cool now i can play the same music in 2 rooms. wrong. they can only be used one at a time but can be controlled by one another.with all of its shortcomings i would still rate rhe echo a 4/5 if it had basic bluetooth speaker functionality built in, but amazon literally blocks you from being able to use it (the hardware all exists inside the unit)i find it hard to get on board with a product that wants so badly to be considered ""cool"" by the tech-savvy hipster crowd, that it is willing to ditch mainstream technology altogether.this device is currently an expensive gimmick. maybe in the future if they release a software update allowing bluetooth functionality will it be worth a second look."

21508,14,"very disappointed.  yes the echo can do many things.  our disappointment is in the fact, no where in the advertisement for the echo does it say that for you to receive all the benefits of what it can do you need to be the main/prime membership holder.  you cannot be a guest under a prime holder.  if we should want to use the echo at the same time as our daughter, it interferes with her enjoyment of using the echo.  if we change a program, it actually changes her program.  thus, we no longer use or have an echo, as we do use prime infrequently and really cannot afford to purchase our own, individual prime membership.please give this thought, as i am sure you have misguided many other hopeful echo purchasers.sincerely, mary olson"

21517,14,"now i am not someone super experienced with audio but in my opinion, this sounds great! i ordered one during the black friday special with the plug add on (which is also amazing). happened to break it out a few days ago and was completely impressed with the sound. after reading reviews, i was worried. this is again just my opinion but it filled the room (kitchen, dining, and living) perfectly and was not only plenty loud at max there but could also be heard throughout the rest of the house. the mic was pretty responsive, as well. with the new whole house audio, i am hooked. i ended up buying a few more while the special pricing is still available. i am totally hooked on all things alexa now and am completely satisfied with this particular purchase."

21520,8,love it.
21521,14,"it is pretty cool, but we need to become better vocal interactors to fully realize this tech. my family and i just are not very voice oriented yet. it has activated a few times from the television, which is annoying, so we have to also remember to turn it off when desired. i gave it four stars only because it picked the eagles to win the super bowl; otherwise i would give it 3 stars for difficulty in getting truly useful information out of it. perhaps the trivia buttons could make it a fun party toy, but for $120, it is a bit spendy. music quality just ok. i think"
21522,8,excellent
21523,8,it is cool
21524,14,"so far, so good.  has helped my teenager get up in the morning.  so simple to set the alarm the night before and play whatever awful music helps wake him up in the morning.  easily moved from one room to another and syncs with personal spotify playlists.  we have a sonos system and got the sonos echo speaker for another room, which we have not used yet.  my guess is the sonos echo is much better sound, but this suits its purpose for alarm/ quick-play music/ getting useful, trivial and/or absurd information instantly!"

21527,11,"<u+00a0>this is the new echo i would recommend for most folks. i am digging the redesign, and the less-expensive fabric cover is great. ... the sound is not as good as the og echo, or the new echo plus <u+2014><u+00a0>but i think it is good enough if you do not need the smart home hub (zigbee) in the echo plus, or if you just do not want to spend the extra $50."

21530,14,"i really like the echo compared to the dot, the speakers are awesome. but i find alexa to be way behind in technology. siri is way better at understanding you. and frequently all the lights light up when my kids are talking to her and eventually it just says she lost connection. we have no connectivity issues with our wifi or movies or anything like that. but our amazon devices frequently lose connection. i try to use the white noise to get my baby to go to sleep and alex keeps talking and asking me if i want to buy things."
21531,0,great idea but alexa is dumb. part of the reason i wanted was to be ablw to answer basic questions without having to look up. alexa had a very difficult time answering basic queries such as sports scored or basic trivia type info on very basic subjects.  this is not much more than a bluetooth interface for phone apps with a okay speaker
21532,10,"i love alexa! she does everything! ""alexa, bark to my dog!"" - she barks! ""alexa, talk to my dog!"" bark!""alexa sing me a song"" she sings!""alexa set my alarm for 2 p.m."" she sets my alarm!""alexa you are a jerk"" ""that is not very nice""""alexa tell me a story"" she tells me a story!""alexa shut up"" she shuts upi love alexa, she is the best! she can even hear me talk clearly from another room. oh and the sound quality is very rich. i could not have asked for anything better."
21533,14,"have had a lot of tech problems with this product.  every request for information, song to play, etc shows up on my ipad--initially told way designed and no way to delete.  finally after saying would return tech support helped me turn this off  i believe agent didnt want to help--just handle call as fast as possible.  requests for calendar, weather, etc. produces copy of calendar,  forecast on ipad.  u can remove them by logging online--no easy way to do directly from ipad according to tech support.  easily clogs up ipad.  had repeated problems synching calednar thru icloud  now spam on calendar--only on echo not on imac, iphone, or ipad.  no help with that  sometimes calendar synced and sometimes didnt  numerous calls -- one i hung up on after repeatedly asking for transfer because accent was so heavy i couldnt understand.  great product if they iron out some of these bugs"
21534,14,"disappointed the only traffic report is ¡®your destination is an hour and 10 minutes¡¯. i was hoping for updates on traffic jams or free flowing traffic as my commute is all highway. i also can not link it to my calendar for whatever reason, though we¡¯ve followed the instructions. i do like that it links to our sirius xm, and it gives me a weather report, but i expected more from it is advertised features. we are retired and not away for long periods of time so to rewire our home for smart devices is not practicle."
21535,14,"amazon advertises this as 2nd generation as ""improved sound"". i thought the original echo (1 gen) sounded great so i fell for the 2nd gen hook, line and sinker. unfortunately after listening to it i find it is a sinker indeed, or perhaps a real stinker.i did an informal test with my 1st gen and new 2nd gen echo. i had them both play a set of songs. i am just going by what my set of ears tells me, but the 2nd gen is greatly disappointing when it comes to sound quality. while it does seem to have a deeper bass, the overall quality sounds much tinnier than the 1st gen. whatever ""powered by dolby"" is supposed to bring to the 2nd get unit is not much, this 2nd gen is just not up to par with the original when it comes to audio.perhaps i am too focused on the sound of echo 2nd gen, but when amazon makes it a point to expressly market it as being ""improved sound"", i would expect the sound to be noticeably improved. it does not and therefore give it a 1 star rating."
21536,14,"what bothers me the most is lack of response. the echo lights up to the wake word, listens to what i am saying and then the ring turns off without any prompt or action on its part. seems to be losing connectivity more than the 1gen as well. it was a frustrating experience and i had to replace it with the old one. keeping the new one in the back hoping that a software update will fix the glitches."
21537,14,"it took me a couple of days to decide if the sound on gen 2 was really better than gen 1 or not. here is what i¡¯ve come up with.  after a side-by-side comparison, i agree with another reviewer who stated that the gen 2 has deeper, richer sound but not as loud as gen 1. gen 1 is louder but tin-ny. i never out grew loud musc, <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0082>  but the bass is better on gen 2.  i just depends on what your definition of ¡°better¡± is. i love my music so this is the only reason i upgraded. i have a small home so the sound is great for me. i moved gen 1 to my nightstand and placed gen 2 in my kitchen.  i have ordered the red gen 2 one for my living room."
21538,14,"black friday deal purchase.  this is a really good product.  i bought as a fail safe item as a music speaker.  it is very nice, on par with my sono 3 at a fraction of the cost.  alexa is amazing, and i am learning to add skills to her.  search is not very good, its bing.  bing usually is bad when compared to google.  that is the lose of star.  the phrases you can ask, and get response from are amazingly fun.  not sorry i bought it at all, and find new things to do with it.  using sirius xm streaming on it, and it sounds amazing."
21539,14,"i had the first generation of echo and thought i would never really use it.time has changed that. i use it all the time.even sync would it with my thermostat and lights.i just bought three of gen 2 and i am very happy with  my purchase.i grouped them using 'multi-room music'.love it! love it!  love it!no matter what room i am in, i have the same program throughout the house.never have to strain to listen for what i may be missing."
21540,14,"rarely correctly understands what has been said. not very useful, i imagine this may be different if i had a lot of smart devices (smart thermostat, security, etc) . has difficulty playing itunes music from my iphone and ipad. has not been able to play siriusxm despite the advertising saying that it could. this thing is just a glorified bluetooth speaker.if i was looking for help buying things on amazon then alexa would be quite useful but i like going on my computer to make purchases. i do not need alexa asking me if i want to buy stuff everyday.manage your expectation if you get one of these things, it is not great but can play npr an help with some of the little things especially if you need help buying more stuff from amazon."
21541,14,"usually, when one buys a bluetooth device, you assume it is a simple process of connecting to the device you want; be it your computer or smart phone. not with the invention of the echo (2nd generation), a device tied to the functionality of an app. want to use it without an app? sorry, out of luck. you just wasted all this time buying something absolutely useless. whoever thought about making an app a requirement for using a bluetooth speaker deserves a place in perdition that dante could not of imagined.update: just to let y'all know, it has no battery, can not simply connect to my computer (i have my phone right next to my computer which picks up the amazon-p8t network, rendering any connection to my computer impossible), and overall is just an absolute waste of space. wish i never would have bought this.2nd update: i really tired. like, i wanted to find someway to like this. after spending over 2 hours trying to setup -- after the thing broke, yet again -- i simply did what any sane minded individual would do with such a piece of junk--destroyed it. most cathartic feeling i have ever had. trust me."
21542,14,"junk, unless you need a paperweight. major connection problems even with a newer amazon fire tablet. i spent 2.5 hours trying to get this pos to work, including 2 calls to customer service. basically it is a bluetooth speaker with lousy sound. does not do most of the things amazon claims it does. spotify haha, it gives you mostly samples of the music you are paying for! amazon basically tries to force you into buying their music service. bought the original echo, amazon fire last year, and fire stick 2 years ago. overall disappointed with amazon products. of course will not compensate you for anything, like hours i have lost dealing with their lousy electronics. complete joke, i will pay more money as long as the product does not say amazon on it !"
21543,14,"i swear i think the echo i received has been used before. the reason i say this is because i noticed what seems like grease or oil stains around the buttons on top of the echo. i pay close attention to any items i receive from amazon upon receiving it, so this was no different. my girlfriend who was next to me when i opened this could not see it, but i know i am not going crazy. i am giving this 3 stars because of that. when it comes to speakers, you do not want to buy one that has been used, unless you know for a fact that it has not been used before. so i tested the speakers with a few songs that have a good amount of bass and sounded good. now i know what you are thinking, if it sounded good then why give it a 3 star rating? for the simple fact that im doubting and the stains surroundings the buttons. i could return this and order another one but i am just gonna bite the bullet, wait a couple more days to see if the quality of the speakers decrease.other than that, this thing is amazing. alarm, reminders, sport scores; i now want to buy smart light bulbs.i bought this with the purpose of only using it for music without having to use my phone or other device."
21544,14,"i wish i had not bothered to buy this, i did not realize that in order for it to perform all the tricks advertised i needed to spend more on accessories.  and because no one i know was sure how to hook it up i needed to pay another $100 to a pro.  then when all was installed i discovered that alexis and i did not agree on the music we liked.  very few classical, almost no complete symphonies, etc. but lots of screaming tuneless ""music"" .  the quality of. sound is adequate but not nearly as good as i can get on my radio and tv.live and learn ..... :-(  wish i could get back my $200."
21545,0,"alexa speech quality could be improved, sounds robotic, interaction could also be improved, alexa cannot interact with normal speech you have to use exact phrases with its skills, it cannot be close or similar to its skills or else alexa does not know what you are saying, or defaults to help instructions, or shuts off, all very frustrating. has potential of course."
21546,11,very disappointed in the sound...which to me does not even compare to the 1st generation.  not sure what amazon was thinking with this.  get the 1st generation if you can.
21547,14,"my grandson set it up for me to work with my phone at christmas, while we were in truckee, ca. i tried to set it up with my computer in atlanta, ga, and have been totally frustrated. and it no longer works with my phone. but while i am listening to tv, it says, ""i am having trouble connecting with the internet. please consult your help app for instructions."" it says that a lot during jeopardy, which is annoying. i do not know what i am doing or have done wrong, but i have a friend who is much tech savvier than i am, and she can not make it work either."
21548,14,"going back. have had the dot for a year and the sound was full for a small speaker. i ordered this thinking the sound would be better. it is atrocious, like putting a tin can over the echo dot.  nice try but do not waste your money or buy this as a gift."
21549,10,"our new echo is perfect for us.  just ask alexa to find anything we want and she responds right away with the information.  we use the echo to listen to amazon music and could not be happier with it.  also, i asked alexa to find an easy listening radio station and she selected sunny radio station in detroit mi.  it worked out great sunny radio is the station for us."
21550,14,this is a really cool device.  my parents got one for my daughter and i liked it so much i ordered one for myself :)  if you like to have some background music or ambient nature sounds this is for you.  it is also handy asking it about the weather before you leave the house for the day.  we do not have it on any smart devices yet but we will probably add a few table lamps or something to it.  i wish it had simpler integration with directv.  i understand it can but requires additional hub devices.  maybe directv will develop it as an integrated skill??
21551,14,"not sure what need this fills.  if you do not care about the audio (e.g. you are using external speakers or want it primarily for automation), get an echo dot.  if you do care about the audio and do not want to add a speaker, get a full-blown echo.  i have two of these (of my nine echos), and they are not that impressive.  like the dot, it requires +/- buttons to change volume (lacks the dial found in the full-sized echo).  the far-field mic array works as well as the echo."
21552,14,"i received my echo 2 today. product exuded quality right from packaging to unboxing to set-up to getting it up-and-running to testing a few things out with alexa (news, songs, weather, restaurant selections, etc. etc.). packaging is simple, hassle-free yet high quality. product look-and-feel is awesome. set-up was a breeze and trouble-free, was up and running in a matter of 5 mins. or less. sound is excellent with deep bass for the size. voice recognition one-of-a-kind and very near accurate. the best part is alexa is extraordinary speed and response time... i can go on and on and on... oh, one more thing: the lights - just beautiful. in a nutshell, amazon echo 2 is the product of the year 2017, without a doubt!!!"
21553,14,i totally love the echo. what i totally hate is the installation process. this is my 3rd alexa related product. i have another echo and a dot. they were both a bear to setup and connect to my wireless network. i am having the same problem with my new echo. i tried for 20 minutes to make it work and gave up. i spent an hour or more on each of the last setups. i do not have that kind of time to waste.
21554,14,"this is my first echo.  unlike others, i actually think the sound is decent, but i do not have the first generation to compare to.  my first issue was being unable to connect to wifi.  a friend suggested it might be the internet company needs to allow the echo through the firewall.  a phone call to the internet was successful.  called at night and the next morning the echo connected.  amazon should include instructions telling customers they need to do this.  i wasted so much time!  another big problem is each morning i come out and the echo is no longer connected to wifi.  i have to go through the setup every morning.  not only that, i have to reset the echo at least once during this process by unplugging and plugging back in then start the setup again.  also, alexa does not know nearly as much as google.  she says ""i do not know that"" a lot.  i would send it back if i was not enjoying the music so much."
21555,14,"super meh. theres so much it cant do. most of the things you can do, the things not requiring additional purchases (subscriptions,smart bulbs and other smart home things alike), are all novelties.  i ask questions that are never answered, like - how much is an xbox one. well, alexa cant do that.settings timers and reminders are useful, especially when it syncs to your phone. the speaker(s) isnt (arent) <i>terrible</i> either. i probably shouldve gotten the google version."
21556,0,"this ""thing"" will say words  or make a sound when i never said the name alexa.  not happy i had to pay to use amazon prime music, when this thing is from amazon....they should include the music for free.do not like anything about this thing.  hate calling it by its name alexa in order for it to play music.  rather would have chosen the name i would like to call it.  ask for a particular genre, songs are played in the same order every time.  very disapointed"
21557,14,"while the echo has some very nice features i had to return it to amazon. the reason... it would not play google music easily and amazon music is just not up to snuff in that regard. amazon music would require me to spend $2 a month so that i can listen to my own mp3s. and, it does not appear to have the ability to favorite stations that i like nor easy to search for those stations.for this main reason i returned the product and opted for the google home system instead."
21558,14,i just bought 2 of these and you can change the device name but it does not change the bluetooth name. i have apple everything so when i play itunes thru the echo i can only see the default echo name of ¡°echo-fc9¡± and not the device name of living room. i called support and they said the device name does not sync with the bluetooth name and it can not be fixed.come on amazon this seems like a really easy fix. i¡¯m going to return the 2 i got since i was going to buy 3 more to have them throughout my house but i do not feel like memorizing 5 different random device default names.
21559,14,"what a great christmas gift! i have 3 echos from years back and an echo show, plus i bought my mom the same... so i decided to get my brothers and sisters and grandma some echoes as well... so bam! very happy, idk why people are complaining about the sound... it sounds great. and at 100 dollars you can not beat that"
21560,14,"i was so excited about this device. the first night we got it, it was amazing and we played with it all night. well after the 3rd day, it is very glitchy. song quiz just stops working, shuts off in the middle of the game. music often will just stop and shut off too. this does not happen with my dot. it is really annoying. we had a bunch of friends over and wanted to play some games and it just keep going silent in the middle of the game. now i wish i had tried the google home."
21561,14,"since last summer, there seems to be a growing trend whereby i order one thing and get another.when i go to check the order, sometimes the order shows what i ordered correctly and sometimes, it shows what i received.i actually started taking screenshots of orders because amazon cs has been certain that i am mistaken, but they have corrected every mistake.once again, i ordered an item... this one, in sandstone... and i received... this one, in charcoal.my current orders receipt shows charcoal, but my screenshots of the order show sandstone.who knows how these things happen, but as the police sang, there is clearly a ""ghost in the machine"".so, part of whether i am happy with a product is if the product lives up to my expectations.i expected sandstone, received charcoal, and thus there is a lump of coal in amazon is ratings.why? because people will read 1-star reviews to see what they might encounter as a worst case scenario with their purchase of any product.well, this is my first echo; i have two dots.the main reason i ordered my first dot? the $29.99 price during december.the reasons i ordered my second dot? i loved the dot, hated google home, and the dot was still $29.99.the reasons i ordered the echo, instead of another dot? the promise that ""powerful speakers fill the room with immersive, 360¡Æ omni-directional audio delivering crisp vocals and dynamic base response."", the reviews that were updated to reflect vast improvement over the initial sound quality at the time of product release, the 2nd generation far-field voice recognition (which by all accounts is even better than the dot, which has been good enough for me to now own 3 alexa devices), because of how much i like my 2 dots, my need for a 3rd device (so i am moving the living room dot elsewhere and opted for the echo in there), and the real deciding factor which was the option to break it into 5 payments.let is be honest, the return might be free, but you are still out that money for a while. so, if you are going to try an echo and see if it is really worth that much more than a dot, then paying 1/5th up front is far smarter on your wallet, if you have read the reviews and are unsure.as for the audio, i definitely prefer the echo over the dot for music, audible books, etc.i am not 100% sold on the final price tag, but maybe on the holiday price.at $20 a month for the 5 months, i will probably get over the final price because i appreciate the option for payments... and maybe by then, i will appreciate the quality of the echo is 7 microphones and far-field voice recognition so much that i decide that maybe it is really worth the $99.99.... but, truthfully, i doubt it. it is a taller dot so it has more room for electronic components that cost a pennies and less, meaning the profit margin is ridiculous and that is why they can afford to knock $20 off for a month during the holiday shopping season.still, i am happy with alexa... and the echo is too tall for the cats to step on, stand on or sit on, so they can not disconnect it anymore. :-)"
21562,14,sound is not good enough to justify not buying the super cheap echo dot.there is a design flaw (or intention).  i can not link one echo dot to my better-sounding bluetooth speaker and then tell alexa to play everywhere.  it is be nice to have my other bluetooth speaker play simultaneously with the echo -- which has decent sound (i would not even bother with the dot -- just a plastic hockey puck)i worry this was deliberate by amazon so more people would buy more echos.  that would be fine if the sound were decent and it is noti hope amazon changes this limitation with a software update.
21563,14,"issue with an inability to stream with sirius xm. customer service provided a replacement in the event that i was sent a lemon. if the issue with sirius xm persist i will consider that a deal breaker. update forthcoming.update: as it turns out, the all-new echo will effectively stream music from amazon music but fails to maintain a signal from sirius xm. coincidence or not? you will have to judge for yourself. as for me... i will ask alexa to play ""is not that peculiar"" by marvin gaye."
21564,11,"i had hoped that the second generation echo would provide significantly better sound quality. unfortunately, my hopes did not come to fruition. echo two does have a smaller footprint and is more attractive to the eye. however, the sound quality comes in only slightly better than the original echo. amazon would have done so much better to keep echo at its original size and insert a better tweeter and small sub-woofer. that would have been dynamite."
21565,14,"we have been enjoying our alexa echo for several weeks now and have had no difficulties at all. we mostly use it to access music and have been enjoying a wide range of music, both mix music in different genres and albums by various artists. no real complaints at this point except maybe the album selection is not infinite and will need to subscribe to a music pack to get certain albums.you can also access weather and breaking news."
21566,14,"received this as a christmas gift and when it works i really enjoy it! the sound to unit size ratio is excellent deep bass and crisp mid to high range makes listening to music very enjoyable! only problem i am having is that after my wife uses it, some of the commands do not work for me unless i unplug it and wait 30 sec and plug it back in, this gets very annoying. if this issue could be resolved this would be a 5 star product!"
21567,14,"for backround: we have a dot, a show, 2 echos, and an echo plus (first gen).i am not  sure of the purpose of this unit.the sound is poor as a stand-alone (even the news sounds hollow and bad), so it really needs to be tethered to speakers (via blue tooth or the aux out). one is better off (1) getting the dot, i think, to save a few bucks and hooking it up to a speaker(s) or (2) paying the extra money and get the echo-plus (can not comment on 2nd gen echo plus; have 1st gen), which has very good sound quality, not hi-fi, but good enough for a large bedroom (but truth be told ,not quite big enough sound for a large great room), and one does not need an external speaker.i notice no difference in the unit is ability to detect voice commands, compared to the first-gen echo-plus (i think it used to be called just echo), the dot, or the show.by the way: the show rocks: has great sound; touch controls on the video screen (allows you to see recipes, web searches, news videos, timers/alarms) - our 12-year old loves it (and so do i)."
21568,10,"love my new echo. i choose the wood-like finish so it is easy to wipe clean and fits in with the clean design of my earth tone bedroom. i use it to control my smart devices, learn new words, keep up with news headlines and i even play games with it. great product."
21569,14,"i bought this to simplify operation of my sonos sound system primarily used with my tv (cable and various internet channels). i got it working with my music service, but never with my tv. even then, raising and lowering the volume with voice commands was hit or miss, mostly miss. if you have  the music (or tv if i got it working) cranked up, alexa can not hear you. i am on the fence whether to send it back. any suggestions or reasons why i should keep it?"
21570,14,"i thought it would offer more but i hear the ""i do not know that"" reply all too often. what i do love about it is being able to ask alexa to play a song. the speaker has great sound but when you pair it with your hdtv there is a slight delay so it seems like you are viewing a dubbed movie. have tried the various adjustments and even though it is better, i have stuck to the tv speakers and used this as a music library."
21571,14,"spotify does not work with this device on the ¡®everywhere¡¯ group. which is the whole reason i bought 3 of these. this type of monopoly is why i left apple.now it does, so changed my review to 5 stars."
21572,14,the echo is not that easy to use out of the box and is too frustrating. returning because after 1 week of use i am more frustrated then pleased. it takes a ton of setup (alexa skills) to make it work like everyone raves about. and then you have to remember the right word combinations to make that skill work.too much work. i was looking for a virtual helper not more work.i am gonna  just get a google home
21573,14,"huge disappointment. the sound is really good and i was very excited about the new group feature to play music on multiple speakers. i have 10 samsung wifi speakers positioned around the house for nightly music that plays throughout. my plan was to replace them all with the new echos in group mode. with four echos to try it out and after a couple weeks of them able to ply sirius or tune-in for maybe an hour before they shut off and tell me ¡°sorry, i can not play the music right now¡± or ¡°the station is unavailable¡± so my only option is silence, i¡¯m giving up on them. i thought it was my wifi giving the echos the benefit of the doubt, but hooked my samsung is back up. when alexa tells me she can not play something, samsung can. so the problem is the echo. i¡¯m a big fan and have purchased several models, but this new one is a big disappointment, can not hold its wifi connection. again, it is not my wifi because the samsung is would not work if it was."
21574,14,"this is a two-part review, because i experienced two different interactions with amazon personnel, from my two orders. my initial order  was a christmas gift for my mother. this order was very special to me, because she had recently loss her dearest girlfriend to a rare form of liver cancer and on their last visit together, they both enjoyed alexa tremendously. this was a joyful gentle reminder of that visit-somewhat. the second reason this gift was important dealt with my mother is upcoming surgery. she merely wanted to speak and alexa would respond. needless-to-say,  when alexa arrived promptly with prime, we were overjoyed. we set her up on christmas day; it was not that straight forward, but we managed to complete the task accurately.  alexa played well for a total 3 days and down she went.  unfortunately, we went through three (3) different troubleshooting processes on each occasion with various reps., it became redundant explaining the problems to them. my patience flew out the window and i arrived at my whit is end on my final service request call!  i instructed them to come and retrieve their garbage and send my moma a brand new device. in all honesty, this was my initial request on when we experienced the first problem, but my moma wanted to be nice, which cost her more frustration. after expressing my disgust with their device, they complied. i made it crystal clear that i did not  want a re-furbished device sent to us. i paid for a brand new device for christmas and that is what i want.  well, can you imagine the thoughts running through my mind when these mofo is sent my moma a refurbished replacement device, after i told them that would be unacceptable! i came from florida to maine in about a 1/2 sec. never missing a beat. i told them to refund all of my money and their trash is, once again, sitting outside waiting for them.part two: after the csr and supervisor spoke to me-again, they said i could order another device, but it would be $20 more (i purchased this during black friday). i told them, ""indeed not"", this was not my error, but theirs! the supervisor complied and credited my new order. when that second order arrived, that device worked perfectly, but it is unfortunate that my moma had to go without her music box, because amazon could not get their act together."
21575,14,"i love my dot and i was hoping this echo would be a big upgrade, but i¡¯m just not impressed.  i was going to buy a few more of these after testing it out. i¡¯m going to hold off for now..."
21576,14,"recently purchased our echo 2nd generation as well as unlimited music.  both were a great addition to our home.  while i do not use the ¡°smart home¡± features, i do enjoy being able to get updated news, weather and other information from alexa.  so far she has been able to find all music we have asked her to play, even obscure songs from long ago.  i also like the versatility in that i can take it from room to room or can plug it into our stereo system for sound through our speakers.  the echo speakers sound great with no distortion (we have it placed on a wooden bookshelf).  it will be great when we have friends over to have her play background music from various genre playlists.  also, i have used the sound effects (cracking fire) as we have a gas fireplace and it was fun to have the crackling sounds of a real fire.  alexa is not perfect with understanding what you want, but i understand this will improve over time."
21577,11,"if you have an alexa you are already sold on the product.  this is my 3rd.  one in my bedroom, one in my office and now i have this beauty in my living room.  fits right in with mid century modern decor.  and the sound?  fantastic.  lower profile too."
21578,9,"i¡¯m alexa obsessed! i bought my first amazon echo a few months ago and fell in love. i have since bought 2 more echo dots (one for a gift), one echo show and this echo 2nd generation. this particular one is my favorite of all of them and the one i use the most. it is shorter than the original echo and the sound quality is great! pair this with amazon unlimited streaming music and you¡¯ll be set! it is awesome!"
21579,14,"amazon sells the idea of a seemless integration between rooms when using more than one alexa. but i read you are left with two individual systems that work together for a couple things. you can not use audiable, spotify and a few other to stream across both devises at the same time. for the most part it is a speaker that can tell you the weather. ¡°hey siri, what is the weather today?¡±another thing is the comands are sometime cumbersome. why not have the speakers link and work as on fully interested system? why not have the option for setting up the fuctionality of how you want the alexas to interact, like have it programable to play across the platform? and nothing drives me more crazy that when i am talking about alexa and it chimes in. i now have to keep my conversation about this annoying thing i invited into my house quiet or take it outside."
21580,14,"this is my first echo device and so far i like it. it hears my voice without any issues and usually does what i ask. i bought a dot to go along with it to put in the kid is toy room so that we can use it as an intercom. it is not perfect, but it works well enough. the sound quality is decent for $100. it is not like this is a high end speaker or anything, so i do not have any complaints there. it works well to change channels on our dish receiver as well. overall i am fairly happy with it."
21581,14,"i was a little hesitant to order the new generation.  there seemed to be a boat load of bad reviews.  but i am glad i did.  most of the bad reviews were based on poor sound quality, which software upgrades have totally taken care of.  i am actually amazed at the sound quality.  nice low-end without the boomy bose nonsense, and fairly crisp highs.  is it studio monitor quality? not even close.  but for the size, it is pretty darn good."
21582,0,"does not really seem like this thing works very  well. most things you ask it says ""i do not know that one"". or something similar. maybe if it used google or something it would be at least as good as a cell phone. sound quality us about as good as a cheap bluetooth speaker."
21583,14,"lots of good features but the alarm will not turn off!a phone call to customer service did not yield a solution. (she is going to call me back and, if the problem gets solved, i will update this rating. in the meantime, one of the main things i wanted this for does not work properly. there are apparently many other people who have reported the same issue. c'mon, amazon -- fix this defect!"
21584,14,"this is my 1st smart speaker purchase. and, i dunno, i guess i was expecting something different. something more. i should have just returned it & kept using my android phone. i can turn on my own lights. heck, half of them were either bluetooth or wi-fi controlled anyway. i had the programmed to turn on & off at set times. it was great. maybe if i was super rich & had an automated smart home it would be more useful."
21585,14,very easy too setup. had it up and running in a matter of minutes. picks up your voice from across the room and i did not have to yell at it.
21586,11,"so convenient and easy to use. smaller than expected, but the color is really nice."
21587,14,"finding out that i could no longer upload my locally stored music to the amazon music app in order to take advantage of all of alexa is voice commands was incredibly disappointing. if you are someone who exclusively uses amazon is streaming services, this change will not affect you at all, and you will probably enjoy your echo device. however, for those of us who keep local copies of our music (maybe because you have some obscure and foreign music unavailable via streaming, or simply do not like your purchases existing on someone else is server), we are completely out of luck.while it is true that you can still connect pretty much any bluetooth enabled device to the echo to play your music, alexa is commands will be limited to the rudimentary options of skip ahead, go back a song, volume up, volume down, play, and pause. which turns it into a glorified bluetooth speaker you can get much more cheaply elsewhere.it is really sad that amazon is pushing their customer base into streaming only, just like apple and google. i actually purchase a good portion of my music through amazon because of the ease with which i can download files locally and not be tied to any streaming service. but amazon is decision to change this really does not affect me as badly as it does some other more committed users to amazon music. while it is true that if you already had a subscription, they will not discontinue their service for you until january of 2019 (unless you forget to renew your subscription), if those people uploaded all of their music and deleted it or lost their locally stored files, they will no longer be able to access them after january of 2019. that is right, their uploaded property will no longer be accessible as per amazon is decision (except apparently an arbitrarily chosen number of 250 songs)."
21588,0,"i am sorry, but i am not willing to stick around for years for amazon to catch up with google. every question it is ""i am sorry i do not know that answer."" every, ""please pay x on spotify..."" it is ""i do not know that aong,"" or ""would to like a new pandora station on (artist i did not name.). the games are terrible. adult ,kids, trivia all terrible. instead of helping with music to calm my yoga class it auses disruptions and tensions. no. i am returning this."
21589,14,"good sound and nice features, somewhat buggy setup. took several tries to connect to wi-fi but then worked fine.calling and messaging continues to be unable to work in spite of e-mail and phone support with multiple customer service representatives trying to resolve the problem."
21590,14,"sound quality poor, echo 1 is better. command response inconsistent, same command different outcomes. like others i bought on blind faith (my fault) expecting the company would have tested its own product sufficiently to support its marketing of the product. sadly, it seems that is not the case. i have not returned them yet hoping a fix will come along, i love the echo 1."
21591,14,"simply put, amazing.  can not wait for alexa to just keep getting smarter.  not at the conversation level like the movies yet, but it is on the way with this thing.  friends do annoy by asking for one song after the other at parties.  let the last song finish!  all kidding aside this is fun.  we use it for reminders, even long term stuff like water filters for the ice maker and hvac."
21592,14,"my wife and i tried it when it went on sale for christmas 2017 for 79.99. we used it for a day and got irritated with the unlimited music pitch and the poor communication with our plex server was frustrating and the connection would drop. it did not really seem to offer much additional ""quality of life"" that it professes. the sound quality was decent, but it just did not warrant the price tag. maybe we will try it in the future if it improves."
21593,14,i love my echo 2.  the sound is rich and it always responds to my commands even from the next room.  i do agree however that it would be nice to have equalizer settings on the app that would push to the unit.  are you listening amazon?
21594,14,"okay, let is try to explain the logic. the echo and 3 echo dots i purchased work great ¡°stand alone¡±. however, i purchased the echo dots (2nd generation) to work in conjunction with blue tooth speaker systems that i already own. individually all the products work great, and as intended.  as soon as you create a group in the alexa app and tell the system to play music throughout the home, the echo dots sever their connection with the bluetooth speakers and begin to play music through the tiny speakers built in to the echo dots. sooo technically it works but if your intent is to integrate multiple units throughout the home i would suggest you not buy this system. i will be ordering the google home to see if it has the same limiting capabilities."
21595,14,awful devise.  there is absolutely no improvement in sound quality what so ever absolute waste of money to purchase. better off saving your money and buying a sonos instead.
21596,10,"our teen loves it. plays her music and the sound seems good to this old mama and her daughter. at first i thought it was kind of silly but i actually like that she uses it as an alarm, a reminder for to get things done, etc. i also ask alexa the weather report, etc. i even scheduled alexa to sing happy birthday to our teen as a morning alarm on her day. sometimes it is the little things. may have to get the hubby one so i can become a little more organized myself."
21597,11,"i expected the sound quality to be at least as good as my first gen echo, but it is far from it. very disappointed. i have both google home and echo and i have always been so impressed with echo sound quality being better than home. not any more."
21598,14,"all new means all new price. nothing different. if you do not have an echo, buy a dot. if you have a first generation echo, treasure it. the new ones (i have 2 new and 2 old) are offering a lot with no real change. stick with what you have until amazon provides a valid reason to upgrade. so far my following their lead to upgrade has left me with less than i had before."
21599,14,"the other echo is i have bought worked. however this one is having trouble playing music, it just shuts off after 1 hour or so.  i have been in touch with support through email, however it has come to the point of calling them. that is the hardest part of getting a time to call support.after doing some research on the web i finally got echo to play music without turning off. you must turn off all other w-fi , then rebut your modem, then reboot echo, then turn your phone wi-fi on only! then walk the sets of setting up echo. once echo is connected, turn on other wi-fi devices. the trick is echo must be the first one to connect to the wireless network."
21600,14,i have a ton of the dots and i thought this being the 2nd generation would be amazing. the aesthetics on this wcho are amazing but it is exactly what the other reviews say. it is not loud at all and it claims to be a bose system. a little disappointed. going to see if i can return and get my money back if not re-gift it to someone who may need a semi decent speaker.
21601,14,"this is not the quality of the first generation amazon echo. i had issues with two of the devices. one would not connect with initial set-up, and the other kept stopping in the middle of a song. very frustrating. i wish i would have bought more first generations before they switched to this one. also the sound quality is less than desirable when i compared them."
21602,14,"i received this as a gift.  i¡¯ve used it for a month.  it does several simple things, but nothing very sophisticated .  for example, i can ask about the weather.  it gives me the conditions and forecast for a town about 8 miles distant.  i prefer the weather undergound apps on my ipad that give these things for a station right in my neighborhood, as well as radar, temp, precip, humidity, current, history and forecast.  to a simple question, it ris likely to ead some info from wikipedia.  to a question that is other than simple, it has no answer, except ¡°i do not know ¡°.  i have not figured out what it is good for.  oh, as a music speaker, it does not cut it."
21603,12,just received it. works like a charm. very intuitive. looking forward to have lots of fun with it.
21604,14,"do not buy it.  wait until they get it figured out - and they will.  amazon has resources.  we bought it when we learned that it would control sonos.  it sort of does.  you need other speakers because the echo speakers are tinny sounding crap.  if you want to know the weather, or set a timer, or any of the trivial applications, it is usable, but not if you want to hear nice sound."
21605,14,thus far its a nice device - got it purposefully for music. funny thing is you might notice that if have one in your bedroom (i move mine about) and your partner snores too loudly at night - it will change the music.
21606,14,"it is very stylish looking. this was christmas gift 2017 took it out of box  end of december plugged it in begun the setup on my ipad,it appears too  me it cost money for certain features. i made a few attempts at trying to use it  gave up put back into the box. i¡¯m usually half way good about setting up devices  so it could just be i did not setup correctly."
21607,0,"is it my voice? alexa does not answer very many questions. ¡°i have no opinion on that.¡± ¡°sorry, but i do not know to answer that.¡± it does keep time and reminds you to do something in x minutes/hours. she did find a jackson browne song - once.it keeps glowing green/yellow rings out of the top all-by itself. maybe she is lonley or is talking to my fire stick?"
21608,14,"have not figured it completely out. paying for music $9.99 per month or $7.99 per month with prime is ridiculous. cannot play my own music from my pc on it. at this point it seems a waste of money. amazon should make a better effort to a better utilization, better instructions, and have free apps to use with it. at this point i am a bit unhappy with the device. i had expected more of it."
21609,14,"i did not have a bluetooth speaker so that feature is useful . my grandkids like the novelty of it . it sometimes is handy to answer a trivia question . what i do not like about it is that it takes over the volume control of my kindle and is constantly telling me it is now connected to my kindle . it even will start playing sound through the echo is speaker when i have headphones connected in the output jack , when obviously i do not want to disturb other people in the room ."
21610,14,"call me old fashion but i was a bit sceptical at first because of privacy but after realizing having a smart phone, smart tv, a car with electronics, this is no different. this is a really handy tool and saves a ton of time. i also think the sound is great! it has plenty of bass.  i have an echo dot in other rooms of my home and have them all connected together. now i have music all around the house. this would be really good for people who have a hard time moving around. it can control lights, play music, you can shop, do anything pretty much that has bluetooth."
21611,14,"looks like i am not alone--amazon, you have got another disappointed customer. i purchased this to replace my dot + bluetooth speaker setup in my bedroom, but the sound quality falls way short of even my cheapo $20 amazon basics bluetooth speaker. this unit gets loud, but even for this non-audiophile, the sound does not have any range. can not believe dolby would put their name on this. it would be excellent if something can be done with a software upgrade...perhaps give us access to the equalizer?"
21612,14,"so my friend had the echo tap for a while and told me about these new 2nd generation echo is that are coming out. i already loved the concept of an echo, but wanted one that sounded a bit better. i gotta say. i love my echo. i was fortunate enough to buy it for $79.99 while on sale. the design is cool, and shorter than the original echo but a bit wider. the sound is pretty good, it does lack a bit of bass, but the speakers are loud and clear. i only use it in my room, but i move it to the living room when my friends come over and it sounds awesome as well. if the speakers are really an issue, just pick up an echo dot. problem solved. over-all, for $80 it is totally worth it. why spend $40 - $60 on a bluetooth speaker when you can just get an echo?"
21613,14,"wow! what a bloody improvement (sound wise) over the 1st generation echo. i am seriously thinking of buying another one of these to replace my first generation echo. if you have been holding out on buying one of these, well do not wait any longer, the 2nd generation sounds amazing. i listen to a ton of british ska 1st generation stuff (madness, the specials, etc), everything after is just garbage and also a lot of big band stuff as well as frank sinatra. it makes earlier recordings (when sinatra sang for tommy dorsey) sound amazing."
21614,14,i only had the echo dots before so i cannot compare to the 1st generation of this product but i love this product.  the sound is amazing.  i like making phone calls using the call feature.  the price is right.similar products are sold by other cellular providers for much more and does much less.i am considering a 2nd one for my upstairs.
21615,14,"i enjoyed the echo very much for about 4 hours, where now it turns on every once in awhile, will not reply, and can not play a song without hitching out. i was so excited to get this on release day just to be super dissapointed. and amazon has had me on hold for about an hour just to order a replacement."
21616,14,"the sound is noticeably superior to the 1st-gen echo. great bass. we miss the volume knob, but we will adapt as i did with our dots. we like the new design otherwise. so far, our only problem is a popping sound (like unplugging a live mic) that happens when we start & end calls to other devices. at $80, though, it is a great value. will get more."
21617,0,"we love echo and  alexa...she is the smart kid we never had....not only does she answer everything we ask, but she can even be kinda of a smart ass....we no longer can  live without echo"
21618,14,"this is my 3rd echo, and first 2nd gen. love the product, and the new echo is a clear improvement over the 1st gen, with improved sound and better bass. still room for improvement with alexa as an assistant though, since she is still very hit or miss on the questions she can answer, but really shines as a voice control for smart home products (lights, plugs, etc.)"
21619,14,"it really a very over rated product. i have all three of these, the dot, the mid size an the large echo.the bottom line is if you are looking for great sound this is not the product. i will remain a bose lover!the extra gimmicks in this product are simply not enough to move me away from the love of good musicwith great sound."
21620,0,"was expecting it to have a a great speaker so we could use it to play music. it is a better speak than the dot but not by much. definitely not worth the extra money.it is a little weird that in the beginning it has to ""learn"" stuff in order to answer your questions. most of the time it answers a completely different question than what you asked. we bought 2 so we could also use it as an intercom but they do not recognize each other."
21621,11,i like the size and look of the new echo 2nd generation but not the sound quality.  the highs and mid-range are adequate but the bass is tinny and has an annoying vibrating buzz.  i did see some reviews that said the device needed updated firmware but my version 592452720 seems to be the latest.  i am very disappointed in the sound quality of the bass and am considering returning it.
21622,10,still learning how to use. love the music quality. love the fun song amazon music has. plus is the list i can create! i always have my shipping list bc i always have my phone
21623,14,"alexa setup seems so simple; however, have not been able to set it up after many tries today.  i am a tech person and set things like this up all the time.  i am confident that i am following the steps appropriately. i am assuming that the amazon website is flooded with people trying to set up alexa / echos.  very disappointed to not be able to use this christmas gift on christmas day.  if it does not work tomorrow, i will be sending it back."
21624,14,"we have had many issues with the 2nd generation that we do not have with our other echo dots both 1st and 2nd gen.  we may even send it back, we have until jan 31, but have not decided.  i do not think the sound is any better in 1st gen, do like the smaller size.  but it has some issues that none of the other echo is have in the house and we have 6."
21625,9,"i love this echo! i was skeptical on buying it because of some reviews saying she was not as loud or the sound quality was not the greatest. but i think it sounds amazing, she runs great i can talk to her from far distances. i love it so glad i went with this one!"
21626,14,"i put off getting an echo for a couple of years, and now i regret waiting so long. i use it every morning for an alarm, although i wish i could have music playing instead of the preset noises (spotify music will play if you have a paid spotify membership). the echo works great with the firestick - just tell alexa to pause and play whatever you¡¯re watching. the speaker quality is great, and i love that alexa will pick and choose what playlists it thinks you will like."
21627,11,"the 2nd gen definitely has better sound then the first generation and looks nicer with the fabric exterior. i now have 2 echos and 2 dots, so that i can stream music throughout the house, the dots are in rooms that i play the music softly in the back ground, the echos are in rooms that i want better sound, i am hooked"
21628,14,"great interacting with alexa, getting smarter to my personal likes. i read reviews from different people concerned with the security issues with neighbors pairing with the bluetooth. from what i read your echo device can only paid with one device at a time so when i am home i just pair my echo with my tablet or cell phone to keep anyone else from connecting."
21629,14,"bought two of them a few weeks back . . . about the only thing i can get them to do is tell the time.  i purchased a hue light kit and a couple of t-p link plugs.  i have programmed the lights, but as soon as i try to use the plugs, i lose the hue lights.  also, contrary to the amazon advertising, the sound is not that great . . ."
21630,14,"i¡¯m still debating whether i want to return this echo or not. i¡¯m not fully satisfied with the sound even after the update. when i listen to some songs that have a lot of bass in it, the song starts sounding really choppy and it sounds like the speaker is about to blow out. i thought the first generation sounded much better."
21631,10,excellent sound use the drop in as an intercom from shop to house as lon as you have 2 devices. easy to set up and use.  has many add in and always adding more a must have.
21632,14,"my wife would always ask me what time it was, what the weather was going to be like...  i never thought having a voice controlled device in the home would be all that effective. after having alexa for a while, now i want to buy smart devices for everything in the home. its just so nice to tell her to do something."
21633,14,we have way to many apple and amazon devices.. hate you both for making us spend this much.. alexa and siri has become our new kids now that ours are grown and out.
21634,1,in love. the speakers are amazing!
21635,14,"what a mess.  volume was out of whack (terrible synthesis), found out it was a firmware issue.  amazon supposedly provided an update, but i did not notice a difference.  very difficult to sync music apps and anything not amazon-affiliated. ultimately returned product. hoping to purchase again when in better shape..."
21636,14,"the sound is not what i expected it to be. the bass is non existent and the high ends are muddy and flat. there is no adjustable sound settings, so what you see is what you get. i¡¯m just not impressed. it is too big to be compact, it is too small to fill the room with sound. i will likely return it and just get a echo dot."
21637,14,"come on, amazon. at least you could have kept a usb-based adapter like echo dot so we could color match our devices.  also no multi-room on spotify. how disappointing."
21638,14,"i love this echo! as soon as i got it out of the box and set up i could tell an immediate difference to the audio. it is vastly improved! do not get me wrong, i still love my original echo and my tap, this however, is the best sounding device yet. i am not an audiophile, so i am sure there are other speakers out there that sound better, however, to an end user, this is a delightful speaker for entertainment, not to mention all of alexa is other features! <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0084>"
21639,14,i asked me kids for a portable bluetooth speaker for christmas.  they got me an echo.sound quality ranks up with a $12 childs toy.  very disappointed.  other functionality mightbe good but i was interested in sound quality.  poor
21640,14,"i do not see what this brings to the table that my android phone/windows 10 pc do not already do, but better.  to be honest, i do not think it is worth having plugged in since there is also the added security/snooping factor that amazon does not admit to doing, but does not deny.  waste of money all around.  i do not suggest purchasing this item."
21641,14,"will not work in canada. or should i say, it will work in canada, but so limited. no reason why amazon can not turn this on, they would make a fortune in canada."
21642,14,bought additional items to control lights and outlets. works great! the sound is incredible and we even got a thermostat you can control from your phone
21643,14,"they seem to pick up sound from way too far away (preempting an echo that is actually closer to the person speaking) some of the time, but they work as a simple echo device.  multi-echo multi-room audio grouping does not work yet on all wifi networks reliabily (nov 2017).. so do not buy these for that."
21644,1,outstanding product!!!
21645,14,"i bought his thinking it would be good to have around since i am alone and disabled, wrong! i can not even get the thing connected and forget any chat on amazon, they are on a permanent coffee brake evidently, no reply at all, no wonder these are getting a bad review! no support, it is going back!"
21646,14,stopped playing my favorite radio station.  the team is not taking care of the issue.  yet the original alexa and the dot had both been playing it just fine.  two days into this unit and i have lost my favorite radio station unless i listen to it on google!  i wasted $49 and lost a radio station.
21647,14,"bought 3 of these, the kids enjoy the drop in feature.  who knew that talking to someone in the same house could be made more fun by making them be in a different room? amazon knew.  the smart home features are nice. not having to get up out of bed to turn the lamp off from across the room makes me glad i ate that double quarter pounder and opted for the biggie size."
21648,11,"i have the 1st-gen echo and bought the 2nd-gen echo for my mother in law for christmas. the sound quality is good but not as good as the first-gen echo. i am not disappointed because the 2nd-gen is at a lower price point. if sound quality is important to you, i would recommend the echo plus."
21649,0,"the speakers are awesome - love that it cues into my online stations and my personal music.  it picks up when i talk to it immediately.  having to add different apps for alexa to connect to in order to answer questions or get information is ok i wish there was a bigger amount of predownloaded ones.  also i was hoping it would be portable, but not a big dea."
21650,9,we had a echo 1 and wanted to use the old one in the kitchen. i had to learn how to connect both of them to play music in the living  room and the kitchen at the same time. really love it.
21651,14,"1) alexa voice recognition and processing ability is not impressive thus far...hope it gets better.2) when intercom¡¯ing between rooms- expect to have to turn volume way up and/or talk very loudly.  this was one of the features i had really looked forward to.3) if you¡¯re setting up more than one alexa product, be sure to only do one at a time. otherwise expect a lot of confusion over the identites of each unit.  wasted a lot of time setting up due to this.4) one of my echos took nearly 8-10 attempts to try and set up.  when unit finally did connect- i was left unsure as to what the problem was the first 8-10 times.update: driving home i attempted to drop in on both of my sons.  i tried 3 times and each time had such a bad connection that i could not make out even 25% of what they were saying. this is while driving thru areas where my phone had 3-4 bars and no less than 2.i¡¯m starting to conclude that the echo (and echo dot) are two products that are not really ready for the market.  if you buy them, consider your money spent as a donation to amazon to help them build an echo device that might work well.more thoughts:  nearly everything i use alexa for takes too much time to occur.  actions should be much quicker.  dropping in with intercom is a perfect example.  i¡¯m a busy man.  when i want to drop in and talk to my kids- i need it to be like a second or two.  you can forget that.  if you¡¯re imagining quick action...do not.another update: finally had a chance to test alexa is ability to recognize my voice over background music.  with music playing on the other side of the house, and with me speaking at regular volume at the doorway of two bedrooms with an alexa- both struggled to recognize my voice thru the music.  recognized my voice maybe 1 out of 3 times.  i literally have zero idea where these positive reviews are coming from.  a lot of people must have very low expectations."
21652,11,"wow. this thing definitely picks up my voice muchhh better from across the room vs my gen 1 echo. it is night and day. before when music was playing on, say, level 7 my echo would never hear my commands unless i literally screamed! now this one heard me perfectly from across the room even when playing loud music. good job amazon. now you are equal to the google home unit."
21653,14,"i bought this not only for the novelty but to also have a speaker in the house to play music. i must say, the sound quality is impressive when you consider the price and size. i play my spotify in the house and the speaker is loud enough to hear clearly throughout the main areas of my house. my only complaint is that my kids are obsessed with it and keep asking alexa stupid things. wish there was a way i could mute alexa from the app and not physically hitting the button. or maybe having alexa ignore certain voices. it should have the capability since you can have alexa learn your voice to customize your routine"
21654,14,i preordered this unit and received it the day it came out.  this is my third echo and i am very unsatisfied.  the sound quality when listening to music is terrible.  i have absolutely no problems with the two first generation echo is. only this new one. if the sound quality was not so crappy i would give it 5 stars like my first generation models
21655,14,"the audio is actually a significant downgrade.  it is fine as an alexa device but i would definitely not purchase this for music.update - amazon emailed the following: ""... letting you know that i was going to email you the fix for your sound quality issue. we have put out a software update that will vastly improve the quality.""i ran the update.  i can tell they may have bumped the bass up a little, but overall it did not fix the fact that this device is pretty awful for music."
21656,14,"i can not get this to work.  it denies my amazon password and when i try to connect to the wifi amazon suggests, i get security alerts out the ass.  i would throw i against the wall if i did not have to repackage it and return it to amazon.  i am so freaking frustrated.  two hours of ""set up"" and i got nowhere."
21657,0,"i love my echo! but, sometimes it glitches and it will not listen to my request. unless you do not mind spending the money, i would not suggest to buy it. only buy it if you do not mind spending the money. overall, satisfied but i get very annoyed with it when i have to repeat myself 5 times and still decides to turn on my spotify when i am trying to open a skill. my main use for it is alarms and music. just because i hate dealing with the glitching."
21658,14,"i bought this for my daughter for christmas and it does not work. it will not stay on wifi anywhere.  this is the 2nd alexa that we have purchased.  the first is the full sized alexa.  we had to send that one out to be serviced after the first month.  instead of a new one, we were sent a refurbished device.  why, when i paid for a new one was not i sent another new one?  now it looks like i can not return this one because it is after the return date.  so i guess they come with a 2 month warranty, after that they are a paperweight.  apple just launched theirs, so i will most likely replace these with the apple one."
21659,14,"i like the echo, but it has a huge feature missing that is critical for parents. it has no parental control features. so kids have unfettered access to any explicit song or detail on the internet they want. as a parent i¡¯m extremely disappointed that amazon has not taken the time to include parental controls. i have those type of controls on my ps4, my pc, my iphones/ipad, etc. but not on the latest and greatest ai...sad."
21660,14,i have an el i used to talk with since my voice box was taken out. it works but just not like t is supposed to. can not use it unless i push the button on top. so hands free and from across the room or so to use it. so far no good. it does work great when it recgognizes my electronic voice and not a normal voice. over all great. just needs to understand handicapped people like me.
21661,14,"very let down with the build quality of the amazon echo 2nd gen! lot of popping and crackling out of the box. wish i could have returned it,however had a funeral out of state to go to and couldnt get it back in time. my echo dots i love but this was a waste of $ :-("
21662,14,followed echo ap instructions multiple times. all efforts to install / setup fail. i previously acquired and installed the echo dot which setup and functioned as advertised but the echo (2g) will not respond to the app instructions. i think the app is poorly written and lacks concise instructions. now i go to the amazon echo product support and it is non responsive to my requests for chat or phone.  very frustrating.
21663,11,ordered gray got the black...cost a star...dont like volume buttons on top liked the dial on the generation one echo...great sound
21664,11,looks great and i like how you can change shells. i bought this stand  from santol creations here on amazon. it is perfect for what i need
21665,14,"i just received my echo (2nd generation) today. the set up was easy. the sound quality is horrible. if the sound is supposed to be improved, i hate to think of what it was before. there was an upgrade since i set it up. it did nothing to improve the sound. i am considering returning it."
21666,14,"i love the echo and have no complaints. he speaker is super loud and it recognizes your voice incredibly well. the ease of use is also very incredibly. but i usually only use mine as a bluetooth speaker. in my opinion it is not worth it. however, if you are someone with a ¡°smart home¡± or electronic devices such as lights and other things that can be controlled by the echo, then that is a whole different story"
21667,14,"entertaining toy, decent speaker,  connects with kindle fire tablet so you can select your music to play, fun to play jeopardy every day, must keep plugged in to use so not easily mobile around the house. took multiple tries to set up and connect to home wifi network."
21668,14,"this thing has proven to be not worth it at all. alexa does not recognize or can not operate at least 75 percent of the functions i ask her to. and a majority of what i ask her to do is play songs that i have in my amazon music library. so needless to say, this cia spy tool is sitting on my end table, unplugged and collecting dust."
21669,14,"with a subscription you can get a wide range of music and it is easy to use. however, at this level of technology it responds like an elderly, intellectually challenged person who is hard of hearing."
21670,14,"it will not install to connect to my wireless modem with password.  tried it from desktop and also cell phone.  when i called amazon support i get those folks in india where it sounds like a war room in the background and person spends more time saying he is sorry than fixing the problem.  i asked for an american support person and was told there was not any.  i am discussed with this echo 2nd generation.  i have an echo 1st generation and it works fine.  i suspect the issue is understanding the software to properly install it, rather than a failure of the product."
21671,14,"minor problems during the initial setup (it took two attempts to get connected to wifi, and at some point it has stopped recognizing wakeup word ""echo"", so i have changed it back to ""alexa""), other than that this is a great device. meets expectations for sound quality and skills. looks good. i use it a lot, plan to buy one more."
21672,14,"if you enjoy googling every single echo issue there is to make these things work...this is the product for you! i¡¯d recommend just waiting until apple gets there ¡®smart home¡¯ stuff up and running.i will say not bad blue tooth speakers, but you can get better sounding ones for a better price."
21673,14,i think i got a dud. my echo does not respond to voice commands well. i have to yell almost every time for speak very slowly for it to recognize me. my amazon dots are way better at recognizing. if i still had the box i would exchange this if i could.
21674,0,"very hard to use the echo. the sound is nice and so is the look, but it fails to offer as much as the google home does. unlike the google home, the echo will not play music for you unless you have spotify premium, amazon music, or etc. while the home offers music stations even without spending the money to get premium music accounts. alexa is voice also is not very clear and does not comprehend my voice well."
21675,11,"underwhelming sound, even after all the updates. i would not recommend if you¡¯re looking to use this as an everyday music player and expecting room filling sound. i had high expections for this product, so that may be affecting my perception. it is a decent deal for $100 if you factor in the features, but falls way short on sound quality."
21676,14,"i love my amazon echos and fire sticks, but i will be throwing this all away if you put ads on echo devices."
21677,14,"i¡¯ve had this and a dot for over two months now and all they have become are paperweights. i still, even after using the faq is and emailing for support, can not get them to connect up in my home.  due to this inability to connect, i can not control any of my insteon home automation adjuncts, nor my sonos system which were my major reasons for purchasing said items. i know others have been able to make them work, kudos for them! i however have had a very bad experience with them.  several of my friends and family have them and i think they¡¯re pretty cool when they work, i just do not have anything positive to say at this point."
21678,14,"i need to play around with my echo more to find out and figure all the features it has. however, i also bought an alexa. it would have been nice to know that the echo seems to work better with android phones and the alexa seems to work better with apple phones. i hope that helps. the speaker seems to be great."
21679,10,have had the echo for a week or so. enjoying the convenience of ordering items on amazon by just asking. alexa is a super convenient timer for cooking and music as well.  look forward to expanding her capabilities by getting smart plugs.
21680,14,"ordered this so that i could play music.  unfortunately, every other piece of music is cut off in the middle.  then it starts about 20 seconds later with something else.  not at all happy that i spent nearly $100 on this and have not yet decided if i want to return it."
21681,14,"so far good, wish commands were better connecting to fire stick. also music selection is not the best yet,"
21682,0,"i have to say that it met my expectations. it still needs to be improved, but im not disapointed. so far this is a great product. hopefully the price will start to come down a little so that more people can get it. however i would not recomend it to someone whos not so technical."
21683,14,"not happy as i was led to believe the sound was improved. i bought this thinking it would sound better then my first generation echo. i am actually disappointed, maybe its because it is in a shorter tube!!!!i have three alexa devices, my set up i have this 2nd gen echo in the den my 1st generation echo in the living room and the i have a 2nd generation dot in the bedroom paired with a jbl charge 2 portable bluetooth speaker. i am very annoyed that when i play the three as a everywhere group it drop is the pairing with my jbl so what is up with that.so what i was hoping for was the same song playing all over the house i am ready to send this 2nd gen echo back.."
21684,11,"compared to my 1st gen echo, i like the smaller size and sound quality better on the 2nd gen.  however, i really miss the volume control of the previous generation. it is much harder to find the volume buttons in the dark compared to the ring."
21685,14,"as an owner of a 1st generation echo and now multiple 2nd generations i will say i¡¯m not disappointed. i waited several days before purchasing new echo and was a little skeptical because of all the bad reviews, but i  am very  satisfied with the new echo. in the way of sound the only difference is notice is that the 1st  generation is slightly louder at the same volume. hopefully this is something amazon can also fix. the far field microphones on the new echo are also greatly improved often the new echo will respond even if i am closer to the older one without delay."
21686,14,this little units pack a punch.  the sound is terrific for something this small.  i have a type of amazon echo in practically every room in the house including the bathrooms. i am getting spoiled and i miss my amazon echo when i am travelling.
21687,14,"it took me quite some time to set this up, as the amazon alexa app on my samsung galaxy s7 could not connect to the echo for setup.  i tried all the procedures amazon support suggests to get it set up, to no avail.  finally i went to https://alexa.amazon.com on my laptop, and was able to do the setup, including connecting to my wifi.  the echo subsequently downloaded and installed an update, and then my amazon alexa app now works!  prior to this update, the alexa app on my phone would just get stuck when i gave it my amazon credentials."
21688,10,"got one for myself, and i love it! sent this one to my brother is birthday, and he lives his! this is a wonderful gadget. you can say, ""play the eagles,"" and alexa plays a playlist of their tunes. we love getting weather reports, too. we have just scratched the surface!"
21689,11,"very disappointed in the sound quality. not nearly as good as my first echo! was not an upgrade, it sounds like a cheap bluetooth speaker."
21690,11,"very disappointed in the sound quality. not nearly as good as my first echo! was not an upgrade, it sounds like a cheap bluetooth speaker."
21691,14,"the reduced size is nice for my desktop, but the volume ring not being there drove me a little nuts!  sounds good, setup is easy as ever, and alexa continues to rock on, but if you love your volume ring ,, you have to order the hub version."
21692,14,"received this device today and i have been trying for 3 hours now to try and get it set up and it will not connect to the internet. tried everything, watched videos, rest it and still can not get it to connect. hoping tech support can help me out."
21693,14,i bought three.  i gave two away.  both people returned them to me and said they were too difficult to set up.  i tried mine and it was a struggle too.  eventually i succeeded and have it up and running.  it is satisfactory.  i guess it has a purpose....mostly to sell products from amazon...they should have given them away free......
21694,14,"sound sometimes excellent, sometimes quite poor, e g. joan baez recording. hate the fact that it only plays one movement of classical chamber music pieces such as string quartets. alexa also misinterprets many of the spoken requests, coming up with annoying irrelevant stuff. is there a way of getting more than one movement, playing the whole piece? also very annoying: the system will often play not the piece asked for from a composer, say beethoven, but a different piece by him. some remarkably good things too: e g ancient marlene dietrich songs in german!"
21695,14,"received the echo, but absolutely no instructions were included nor was the remote included.  no luck in trying to get amazon to reply, so using this method.  have the book, amazon echo master,, but it refers to directions not inlcuded in the shipment.  very frustrated!  useless without the instructions and remote."
21696,14,"this is ok. i set it up, but then you have to buy music for it and does not just have a play list like the google home.  i returned this product."
21697,14,"i was very excited to add the echo to my home however, i was pretty disappointed it in alexis limitations. this unit does not have a search engine so if you do have a question as far as needing the internet to just quickly answer the question it says that she is not sure about that. it is cool that she can stream music through pandora but really i can do that through any other laptop, computer, cell phone and or ipad as well. thinking about actually selling my unit."
21698,11,the speaker sounds like they pulled all of the base from it. it sounds empty. i returned this for the echo plkus and it sounds 100x better and has a hub built in for an extra $50.
21699,14,"the app to set it up is unbelievably slow, crashes, and fails to connect to the echo to wi-fi. i¡¯ve spent 2 hours troubleshooting and it is been incredibly frustrating dealing with the clunky app. wish i had saved my time and got a different device."
21700,14,"the sound on this is really good and the responsiveness to my voice is much better than the ""puck"". i can be facing the opposite direction of this echo in bed and it still hears and responds to what i ask!  love this thing!"
21701,14,once you get the commands down it works good. we have fun around my home playing music and being entertained by alexa. we have it hooked to our fire stick and harmony remote for voice control over the tv.the thing i do like it being away from the house and using my alexa app to drop in at home and talk to the family. you need to have a strong internwt signal to work all that alexa can do and i think i have only figured out a small amount of her capability.
21702,14,"i am so disappointed in you alexa.... the first echo worked on christmas day and then played nothing but kidzbop no matter what i asked, could not be reset with tech support. the second one played one song from the station i chose, and then kidzbop, and barney radio, and a lullaby... is this a joke???"
21703,11,the sound is much better...but we think...the 2nd echo has more trouble understanding.  we do not know...if our is has been updated....or not.
21704,14,so far so good. the commands works great. i would request amazon to improve the look of this device so it can belong to the family room.
21705,14,"not perfect but close to it, it has a lot of potential but sometimes feels a bit limited hopefully it continues to evolve. so far it is okay not exactly the ""smart house"" from the movie but we will see how much it improves"
21706,14,"so far, i like my first generation echo better. the new echo seems to come with a bug or two. i hope they get patched but it does not come running as smooth as the original echo.spotify cuts in and out. i have tried disconnecting my spotify and forcing an update by muting the echo for thirty minutes <u+2014> nothing worked. again, i hope this is patched.the speaker quality is better but i can rarely enjoy it with being distracted by the spotify bug.as a loyal amazon coustmer and i am hoping updates will continue to make the product better."
21707,11,i have all the previous echos and this one has bad sound quality.
21708,11,i did the coke vs. pepsi test and the sound is slightly improved from the original echo. favorite part is the price. it also matches our mid-century modern couch!
21709,14,still learning it. so far it is not as good as the google home assistant at finding content on the web and it can not seem to read from my cloud drive. it has good loud sound but the google device sounds better. that is all for now
21710,11,"a pint sized version of the original that does not disappoint. although smaller than the first echo it still delivers aclear and deeper audio. i find it very appealing, i also have the original to compare it to, good job."
21711,14,"like most reviewers have said the sound is not stellar, even with the 59452420 firmware .  better than the dot for sure but hardly better than the original echo.  i needed another echo so i am happy with this unit for $99, but it does not solve my whole home audio needs like i had hoped.  maybe gen 3 will do the trick.edit 11/24/2017firmware 592452720 has made a huge difference, much improved so adding 1 star"
21712,14,"back in october i bit the bullet and decided to buy a gen 2 echo. not the worst $99.00 i have ever spent but it is probably 2 or 3 on my list of dumb purchases. for starters i really do not have much use for it unless i spend a pile of money on echo controlled light bulbs, outlet controllers, thermostat, and countless other things i do not need to add or replace.it really does not replace anything i already have such as a radio. so as an experiment i turned it off for a week and discovered i did not miss it. it is back on and i have not used it yet. definitely something i do not need."
21713,11,not as good as the 1st generation in sound.  it is smaller and comes with different cover configurations - so that is a plus for those looking for those options.  i continue to use the 1st gen much more than my 2nd gen as audio output is my favored way of using the echo.
21714,4,setting this up is so difficult it is a joke.  good product. horrific software
21715,11,i was very disappointed with the sound. i have an original elaxa which sounds much better. i hope i got a defective unit. i returned it because of that and it did not come with a remote. (which i think is a must have).
21716,14,"many of the complaints seem to be compared to generation one.  my issue with this is actually compared to the regular echo.which i recently purchased as well.  the echo seems to acknowledge your commands but there is about a one minute delay on any initial command.  after that it seems to work fine.  as far as the sound quality goes it would be good for a medium size room is probably of average quality sound compared to other bose or jawbone products.  the main feature of alexa does not work properly therefore for this reason i will be returning my first amazon product.as a follow up someone from amazon contacted me. if i run the update they just released the connectivity latency issues would resolve. they have not, however, i ordered two. the second came yesterday and works without problems so far."
21717,14,"update:i left another review a few days ago (see below), but i wanted to send along a totally new one, as things have changed for the better. major props go to amazon here, as they read my original (rather scathing) review of the 2nd generation echo, and were concerned to the point where they actually gave me a call to go over my specific issues. they obviously listened to me, and i¡¯m sure others, as they called again this morning and asked me to listen to one of my review songs. unexpectedly, i was pleasantly surprised, as they fine-tuned the system to the point where it is much better through a software update.while i have now decided not to return the three units, i have to say that, although they are better, with significantly more bass, they still need to fine-tune what audiophiles call the ¡°brightness¡± (without sacrificing the bass), which is strange because dolby is usually pretty good with that. bottom line is that they are much better, but still not as good as the gen 1. i hope that what they did here may be indicative of what else is to come.this all leads me to wonder if they might want to consider some sort of equalizer within the alexa app, as others have noted. for those that manage to get themselves out of whack, a simple ¡°default¡± button would get them out of trouble.bottom line is that they managed to improve the unit, and i will now keep them. please make certain that you have the update 592452420 before you pack them up and return them. i have upgraded my review to 3 stars for now, shooting for 4 or 5.my first review...i¡¯m heavily invested in the echo ecosystem to say the least, as i have purchased 14 of them, of which 6 were gifts. i have been a big supporter of the line, and have been very happy with them¡¦until now. i really think that amazon gave google a gift-wrapped package with the echo 2nd gen, as i received my 3-pack and am extremely disappointed with the audio quality. i find it very difficult to believe that anyone who has experienced the audio quality of either the 1st gen, or the tap can say that the new version has the ¡°improved sound¡± that amazon has touted since introduction. i suppose that all three of my 2nd gens could be defective, but i doubt that.while the higher tones seem somewhat better, it appears to be totally at the expense of the lower end, as there is minimal bass tone at all. when a side-by-side test is done with the original 1st gen, the tap, and a dot mounted in a mokcao power+ speaker adapter, the difference is even more pronounced and even more disappointing to all who listened. even the mokcao is better. also, the sound begins to deteriorate totally at around level 6, as indicated by others. did not amazon bother to do a similar test? seems doubtful, as it is extremely eye-opening. while i totally get it that folks who have never previously owned an echo device, or have owned a dot, will likely think the 2nd gen sounds great in comparison, one cannot possibly understand the difference from the original without actually experiencing it.as noted above, i¡¯m obviously a huge fan of the echo environment, and will continue to be, and was really looking forward to receiving the new units. amazon made it look like an upgrade to the original at a lower price, but it really turns out to be a smaller, better looking device that actually sounds like a much better dot, but nowhere near the original echo or tap."
21718,11,"it is pretty good. somehow, the older echo device in better in terms of sound quality, ease of use of the volume dial (rather than buttons).it is small and looks nice though, and it is louder than the previous echo."
21719,14,"works very well, as expected except i was hoping the speaker would be noticeably better.  the speaker is slightly better than my original echo but almost un-noticeable.  i was expecting more bass similar to a sonos or bose speaker and this new echo does not have it.  i do like the ability to sinc it with my original echo to create a group and stream the same song in different rooms.we use alexa almost exclusively for music and i am still in need of some bass for the music."
21720,14,wish the sound quality was better!! too much treble and hardly any bass. even after the updates sound did not improve. i love amazon products and am a fan of them so this is not a anti amazon product review. tested the echo plus at a retail store and it sounds a little better but not much.
21721,14,"bought 3 2nd gen. they all suck! sorry not being hyper critical but dang! you guys missed passing this through qa firstunits are super laggy , unresponsive and do odd things that gen 1 does not do.on top of that sound quality is extremely poor compared to gen 1 i will be retuning all these units and possibly be switching out to google home if you do not acknowledge the blunder and fix this.thank you for the opportunity to provide feed back ..."
21722,0,i like it but i wish it could work without having to be plugged on wall.
21723,11,"this model is $100 cheaper than what i paid for the 1st generation and it shows. sound quality is poorer, microphone is poorer, and they ditched the handy volume control feature where you turn the top of the unit (like a knob) for buttons. i miss my gen one."
21724,14,this assistan7yvv-zpgf t  works well and the speaker is both good sounding and loud. this unit controls our lights and a smart plug. it is easy to get spoiled to asking alexa to do something v doing it yourself. this is both fun and practical. get one you will not be disappointed.
21725,14,"i liked the technology. but the choice of music is limited to only american and very little reggae music.i will like to see more choice of  music from trinidad and tobago,  which are calypso,soca and soca parang music.soca parang music  are christmas music from trinidad."
21726,10,this is my first alexa.  it connects well with the other devices and controls the lights. i love that you can ask it to play songs. my kids always play around with it. i can not wait to see what else this can do.
21727,11,audio is no where near as good as the first gen echo. huge step back.
21728,11,love the echo. second one now. up and down. great sound to speakers
21729,14,"well had to return the first one,but so far this new echo is working correctly..i really do not see a big difference in the sound or task that the original echo did compared to new echo except the higher price."
21730,11,"never had an echo before so i am still getting everything connected, but the sound alone is comparable to my bose mini soundlink.  i am very happy with this and have not found anything it cannot do besides clean the house."
21731,14,terrible for making phone calls . the people upu call hear an echo. you sound like you are under water. does play music ok. often misunderstands. has limited capabilities. requires lots of expensive add ons to do things. doesnt even work as an answering machine. but it is a cool toy.
21732,14,"total waste of money.  the only reason i gave a 1 star is because there was no zero star option.  i would not have another even if it was free.  total brand ""chip on the shoulder"".  my entire music library 50k+ songs are stored on google play music and just because it is a ""competitor"" this piece of junk will not access my files on google play.  this is nothing more than a $100 paper weight.  why do not you swallow your pride and allow cross-brand access?  you would definitely have a more pleased client base."
21733,0,i am not impressed by this. i seems to understand me better than siri but she can play my downloaded music. having to use amazons stupid music unlimited means i have to be extremely specific otherwise she just guesses a song. other than that i do not see a point to buying this. all it does right now is tell me the weather.
21734,9,i like the concept but our dog is absolutely frightened by it and climbs up and shivers in our lap whenever we invoke alexa.
21735,14,"overall sound/quality is great.  one negative about this item is, in order to listen to full songs (not just demo version) by telling alexa to play music, you will have to subscribed to amazon music, which is an additional $3-$4/month for prime members.  i already have apple music (which i recommend) and is unable to sync with the echo device.  so i am subscribing to two different sources of music just so alexa can play full songs by my request.this item would be 5 stars if i was able to sync my apple music library to the echo device."
21736,14,"a couple of years ago, when amazon announced it is prime family sharing, i added my father as the additional adult to the prime household. i¡¯d like to mention that nowhere in the description of prime family sharing does it indicate in any way, shape or form that the additional member needs to be at the same physical residence. it simply says ¡°any adult¡± and goes on to explain the possible financial consequences that might occur since that other adult would have access to your credit card information and could place orders using it. he lives in florida, i live in rhode island.at some point my father decided to purchase some dots in case my mother needed to get help due to a fall or some other emergency. she still vividly remembers the german air and rocket attacks on england during world war ii, so that should give you a idea of her age and why he would do so. he also purchased an echo connect.prior to christmas, my wife was visiting a friend who has an echo device, witnessed some of its capabilities and decided to get me an echo 2 as a gift. upon realizing the potential that my wife would be able to use the drop in intercom feature to contact me for assistance no matter where i was in the house, i decided to purchase four dots and strategically place them in our three story house. why? because she is a pancreatic cancer patient and was (and did) have major surgery january 3rd to remove her tumor. (it is called the whipple procedure, it is invasive, and they remove whole and partial internal organs and then reconstruct.)shortly after installing the devices, we started getting incoming call notifications from phone numbers that we did not know and some were announced as being from people we knew to be friends of my parents. we could not stop the devices from doing so by turning on do not disturb to disable ""incoming call"" notifications as we swiftly realized that by doing so the drop in feature is also disabled. that part completely makes no sense whatsoever considering that do not disturb and drop ins are two different setting menus in the alexa app and the alexa app does not warn the user in any way that drop ins will be disabled. basically one of the major reasons why i purchased the devices went up in smoke.upon asking for tech support via chat, something that took over three hours to do because your people can not read or write english or understand logic, and a phone call from a tech support person we were informed that this is actually a feature built into the programming. in addition, the definition of a household as far as alexa is concerned is essentially the same as prime family sharing. the phone representative confirmed that there is no way to have the devices that are in florida only announce incoming calls on the devices that are there and not also on the devices that we have in rhode island. there is absolutely no logical programming reason for this to occur and not be able to segregate devices since his devices were registered to him and my devices were registered to me and we both had physical addresses entered into the device settings as well as our phone numbers.nowhere in the marketing for the devices does it say that this will occur, nor in the descriptions of the family sharing. basically, it is an undisclosed flaw and deceptive marketing.the phone rep suggested that if we set up voice profiles, confirmed our devices were set to the correct numbers and addresses, the call notifications might stop. they did not. after some time of frustration of us dealing with these incoming call notifications, and of a desire to let my wife actually get some rest after her surgery, he dropped himself from our prime family sharing plan. he should not have had to make that decision at all.and guess what? after he dropped we still got call notifications for a little over a day and during that time period it finally dawned on me that my devices were not announcing incoming calls. upon checking our settings we both came to the realization that what was actually being announced were incoming phone calls to his landline via his echo connect. this is something that your tech support people should have immediately asked! ¡°is there an echo connect involved?""upon doing some research on your support web site, something your company does not even provide a link to from your retail site, i finally discovered in an easily overlooked ¡°note:"" that these devices cannot announce or accept incoming calls from either landlines or mobile phones but can only place outbound calls to such. essentially, to get actual ""call notifications"" you have to purchase an echo connect, and as i understand it that only works with landlines. again, a serious flaw that is not mentioned in the marketing at all, so yet another example of deceptive marketing. especially since you advertise them as being communications devices and show ¡°incoming calls from...¡± but never disclose those incoming calls are actually alexa to alexa only without having a connect!most egregious of all, the marketing for the devices do not mention that they cannot place outbound calls to 911 without having a connect. and these are communications devices that you advertise as being able to place calls to any number? seriously? not only should they be able to, they should be able to automatically give 911 the physical address of the device as that is a setting in the alexa app!this 911 flaw combined with the disabling of the drop in feature of ¡°call¡± notifications makes these devices nothing more than worthless toys. they are not communication devices at all. that is just marketing and deceptive marketing at that. is amazon waiting for someone to have an accident and not be able to get help, be seriously injured and or die, and then get sued for millions for the design flaws and marketing practices? eventually, that is exactly what will happen.additional flaws include the fact that you can create to-do list items by voice, but have to pull out your phone and use the alexa app to clear them. if you use your voice to set more than one timer, you have to use the alexa app to cancel one of them. one of the devices suddenly stopped using our wireless network and had to be reset. i could go on, but you should get the picture by now that these things are worthless, hence my returning them."
21737,14,"overall, i love this device, but the fact that i had to call customer service to turn off the alexa call feature has reduced my rating from 5 stars to 3. there should be a way to turn it off in app!"
21738,10,"even my husband has started using this!  great little device to put in any room.  sync is with sirius radio, so we listen to the news and pretty much anything else that is available online.  love this!"
21739,14,"i have tried unsuccessfully for the last seven days to complete the set up of echo. i downloadedthe alexa app to my cell phone. i opened the app and it told me i needed to go to my cell phone settingsand connect echo to the internet.  after connecting successfully, it told me to go back  to the app and completethe setup. i got back  to the app and was told i needed to connect echo to the internet. i iterated this process severaltimes - still no echo working. the app is anything but user friendly, and i an very disappointed. can i return the product andreceive a refunded"
21740,10,"i got this for my annoying 8 yr old who asks too many questions. alexa plays his favorite songs, spells out words for him, does his math homework, and tells him corny jokes. best investment ever!"
21741,11,this is the perfect upgrade from your echo dot. it sounds so much better. i bought this one for my daughters room and i was surprised with the great quality sound it has. perfect for a bedroom or office. does not take up much space at all. seems to listen better than the older products.
21742,14,i was very happy with the old echo and echo (dot) but not with the new echo or echo plus.  amazon must have reprogrammed it somehow because i find myself shouting at the unit (15 feet away) for it to pick up my commands.  it also did not pick up my commands correctly either.i also returned the echo plus because it stopped talking in the middle of a sentence and shut down repeatedly.  very disappointed.
21743,14,"echo will not connect to my itunes, they want me to buy amazon music. i was instructed to connect my music through bluetooth . the echo continually told my it did not understand . returned it ! over priced !"
21744,14,"it is odd that from the front the sound is great but from the back it sounds terrible, if that was not the case i would have given it 5 stars.also alexa does not always listen as well as i would like."
21745,12,"still learning about this product, but so far we enjoy it!"
21746,14,"so i ordered this for my wife as she works at home and it would be very useful.  she also wanted to use it on the porch when she chooses to work outside.  when it arrived i was surprised to find that it was not a wireless device and has to be plugged in at all times.  amazon advertises this in all of the pictures without the power cord visible.  just look around at this on amazon and you will see it on a table, a kitchen counter, and there is no cord.  very deceiving amazon.  i expect the photos to show the actual product as it has to be used.  will be returning."
21747,14,"seems better sound than my trusty first generation , but happy i have a echo in my bedroom. like the play feature in sync. the call out  worked and sometimes not. probably operator problem."
21748,3,what is a pirate is favorite exercise? the plank.why does snoop dogg use an umbrella? fo¡¯ drizzle!why did karl marx dislike earl grey? because all proper tea is theft.
21749,14,this thing is awful. i have one next to my bed and one in the kitchen. neither one hear me worth a darn. especially the one next to my bed. i find myself shouting at it and getting very angry.
21750,14,"deaf as a post! reset, uplugged and restarted 4 times...still can not hear a damn thing with just a little ambient noise. put alexa gen 2 back in it is place and guess what, works no problem."
21751,14,"today i got an email stating alexa can say good morning in japanese!!! unfortunately i bought this piece of crap to voice command my streaming television on playstation vue. alexa voice commands do not work when using playstation vue. alexa recognizes the voice command, but does not actually change the channel. i wonder if alexa will soon now the japanese translation for ""waste of money"" and ""order me a google home please!"""
21752,11,we must have bought this after the update folks were complaining about because the sound is better than i expected it to be.  we have a portable bose soundlink color and i thought it would be on par with that.  to my ears it exceeds the soundlink color.  now i want more and i am looking forward to having more echo speakers spread across my house.
21753,14,thought it could do more than it is doing.  wanted it to work with firestick and smart tv to it to turn on netflix. tried it out and it ordered a movie i did not want. luckily i was able to get a refund.
21754,14,i sadly agree with the sound issues. i returned this the same day and kept my old trusty first gen around. i tried the echo show after and the sound is better on that one too. too bad
21755,14,"the sound was disappointing, especially when comparing to the the first generation of the echo. i was lead to believe the sound would have been similar. looks were great, but ultimately i returned due to poor sound. however, to be fair, i read recently that amazon pushed an update to all the new echos that is supposed to significantly improve the overall sound. i have already returned mine, so i am unable to provide any updates on my review of the sound after the software update."
21756,9,"this thing is amazing, we love it and highly recommend."
21757,14,"speaker sound very crisp and clear, and easy accessibility with voice is also a major plus. unfortunately, at times i have found myself having to repeat my request  because alexa ""did not quite get that."" however, i must admit i just received the product so i am sure that is more to learn about. with that being said, this is a very user friendly device without all the extra hoopla. great purchase."
21758,14,music sounds very tinny. had a hard time keeping it connected.
21759,14,"we got this for our 98 year old mother, and after a couple of times of instruction,she now talks to her all the time.easy to set up and use, plenty loud for the hard of hearing."
21760,0,"alexa is sooo damn cool, i just love her and what s so funny about the whole thing is that she is not even human but you can not help referring to her as if she was a real woman....lol i just love her....see there i go again!!!"
21761,10,really enjoying this in our home!!! have since found that i can set it to listen to lds general conference talks and to lds library - even to read the bible and  the book of mormon! wow
21762,7,amazing base when playing music. comparable to sonos devices. <f0><u+009f><u+0099><u+008c><f0><u+009f><u+008f><u+00bb>
21763,14,"i have a few taps..original echo and this.  this drops internet constantly.  i really can not tell a difference in sound.  the look is great.  but i give it a big ""ehh"" in the upgrade department"
21764,14,not sure why folks give it a bad review the speakers are great and very useful for nest and wireless plugs. this is my 3rd one i am buying (same exact ones as a present).
21765,14,this is not an improved echo.  after a month it stopped working.  i should have believed the reviews.  not happy at all with the quality.  my first gen still works very well.
21766,9,great product. how did i go so long without having one. love all the features and i think the sound is great. i have friends who have gen 1 and i think this sounds better.
21767,14,"so in love!!!! the setup was a little more complicated than expected, but once done its amazing! my whole family were in the living room all setting up and trying out different things!!! should have ordered a long time ago!!!!"
21768,14,"visually, i like the compact form and the skin options. however i may end up returning this echo if it does not improve with an update soon. the mic is worse than the previous model. it is painfully slow to respond and frequently becomes stuck in listening mode. love the lower cost but still not worth the money in my opinion."
21769,11,i do not believe the sound is better it sounds and looks cheaper even though it is more expensive than original the response time lags and the apps rarely work
21770,0,"instructions for using are very poor.  trying to connect to iroomba or music was very difficult and frustrating.  once you get it pairedit does not last,days later it was unpaired and do not know why. need better documentation!!!!!"
21771,14,"i have seen this product work in my sister is home.  so i bought one.  it was impossible to set up.  amazon is set up instructions are virtually non-existent.  the phone app did not work.  the computer-based installation did not work.  after an hour on the phone with an alexa rep, we could not get it set up.  amazon still needs to work a ton of bugs out of the installation and set-up process.  i am returning this piece of garbage."
21772,0,"it is ok. i keeps glitching and randomly saying things like ,""i do not know what went wrong"" and for whitenoise will not loop like it says it will."
21773,14,the sound really fills the room. the echo will stop playing for no reason. wifi speed is vey strong. really frustrating when the system drops.
21774,9,i thought it would be the dumbest thing i ever bought. it is so dumb i bought three of them for my family for christmas time! these things are so cool.
21775,14,i am really worried i order these for my daughter is for christmas and all the bad reviews has made me nervous wondering if i should send them back..i had a reason to be nervous my daughter is echo stopped responding to her
21776,14,basically it kept cool until i tried to call my friend -- it is a poor experience as the echo got offline frequently with alexa app running in the foreground. i am very disappointed and shocked to see the feature launched with a so obvious bug.
21777,14,i really like the new shorter size! i replaced my kitchen dot to have better sound while in that room. now i am not afraid i am gonna knock it over!
21778,14,"have never been able to get it to connect to internet, it is been 3 months!  no one seems to be able to get it to work, not even my internet provider (cox) who spent 3 hours with me on the phone."
21779,10,alexis & i have a great friendship now! we absolutely love this in our household. my 3.5 year old even knows how to ask her to turn on music!
21780,1,i feel the sound quality is amazing for the price. alexa works well and the functionality of this device for the money makes it a no brainer.
21781,14,"first, the foreign based amazon customer support is difficult to communicate with. articulating technical issues is difficult enough but having to communicate with someone about a difficult to explain subject matter when their primary language is not your own frustrates the process. second, the echo i received has a misaligned light ring. on the original echo and the dot, when setting alexa to volume 0, there is a single white light on the color ring at the 6 o'clock position. when setting to volume 5, half the ring is illuminated white from 6 o'clock to 12 o'clock. however, on this unit, the 0 position starts at 2 o'clock. thus, if you invoke the volume 0 command, a single white dot is at 2 o'clock (therefore, volume 5 results in half the ring illuminated white from 2 o'clock to 7 o'clock). this is inconsistent with previous echo devices and makes no logical sense. perhaps during assembly the light ring was incorrectly aligned when installed. perhaps this is a software issue. i attempted to call echo support and my experience was akin to talking to a wall. after trying to explain the issue multiple times with multiple support people i got nowhere. i am very frustrated with the lack of support and acknowledgement from the echo team. i finally got through to us based echo support and was promised a call back and never received one. fellow echo users, do not you want amazon to know about issues and resolve them? photos attached to this review show volume 0 and volume 5 (as you can see in the pictures, the alexa is oriented with the minus at 6 o'clock and plus at 12 o'clock)"
21782,14,"i wanted to love her. after setting her up, she worked about 60% of the time. would arbitrarily stop working in the middle of a game or song. i started noticing problems with my home av system, control 4, where when i would log on to our network, my laptop would say my ip address was being used by another device. our light system started going haywire, and finally our roku quit responding, along with the tv in general. when the techs came to fix the system the only thing they could find that had changed was alexa was now part of the network. i removed her, and viola, no more ip address, light, tv or network issues. i searched reviews to see if anyone else had similar household network integration problems, but all i saw were comments about audio quality, which ironically, was probably the best thing about my alexa.update: i returned the echo, after having our av guys come to the house and work on the system as she still did not work properly. i decided to reorder another echo, and for whatever reason, this echo has not had any interference issues with the network. who knows what was wrong with the first one, the techs could not say, but the previous issues seem resolved. of note, the previous echo was ""glitchy"" from the very start, this one seems to run more smoothly, with only a few interruptions when reading an audio book, or playing games. it is still not perfect, but light years better than the original echo. raising my rating to three stars from one, based on the interruptions and not great audio quality of my current echo."
21783,10,"love this thing!! very responsive and plays music for spotify, pandora, iheart radio and amazon music.  weather, news, traffic, set timer."
21784,14,it is louder and picks up my voice in other room.  having problems with belkin wemo now.  anyway love alexa but do not see major changes????
21785,1,"looks nice, behaves well."
21786,0,very disappointed in search features. when asking general questions alexa never seems to know an answer or understand a question so i end up utilizing google searches on my phone. very disappointed in search capabilities as this was why i purchased alexa.
21787,14,"returned it without opening it. alexa is pushing left-wing politics in her responses to certain questions. thanks but no thanks, amazon. stop trying to push your politics on your customers."
21788,14,"if i could give it no stars i would.  do not waste your money.  this thing sounds like cheap speaker wrapped in duct tape sitting underwater in a barrel.  sound quality i would give it a solid negative 5, volume, i would give a solid negative 10.  i have a few friends that had a gen 1 and those sounded beautiful.  this is a piece of junk.shame on you amazon for releasing such a disappointing product.i will be returning it."
21789,14,the biggest hurdle i have with echo is that it does not work outside of the us. it is not advised when you buy that the product is only suitable for us. poorly designed for use by general public. does not integrate easily with everything as advertised.
21790,0,so far she has been a little buggy...will shut down sometimes and has trouble finding the music i want. i wish she had a better search engine and could answer more questions or find specific songs/albums (which i know are featured on amazon unlimited) more easily!!
21791,14,"okay, this product would rate 5 stars if the enclosed directions had been printed in a readable font on a meaningful piece of paper. electronics in general share this problem which amazon should correct. went to google for directions."
21792,11,i replaced my echo dot with the new echo to use in my kitchen. i have high ceilings and the sound is great-i think it is as good as my bose soundlink.
21793,11,like half the sound of the original it is horrible
21794,0,"we have three echos.  i love them. the only problem is that alexa speaks a bit of klingon,  but does not understand when you speak klingon back to her."
21795,1,"alexa is educational, entertaining, funny (on occasion), informative, and a great assist around the house.  the echo is reasonably priced, reliable, easy setup, and a great addition to household."
21796,11,sounds great. i had/have an echo dot also.
21797,12,"i love this!!!  i am still learning all the skills, and need to sync with my fire stick but so far so good.  and the sound quality for such a little speaker is amazing!!"
21798,14,"easy setup, easy to use, does everything i expected. i had temporarily tried an ¡°off¡± brand and there was no comparison. this is much better!so much fun forthe whole family"
21799,14,not sure why i waited so long to order one of these things.  i have automated a ton of things in my house all controlled from echo.  only negative thing i can report is i am becoming lazy lol
21800,0,"alexa and i are still getting acquainted. she does not seem to appreciate that i say please and thank you, so i¡¯m not sure we are right for each other. :-)"
21801,14,"we like the taste of the candy almonds  and it was received on time. there is nothing we did not like, oh, except maybe the price"
21802,0,a little confusing when it tells you what app to download.  but it is amazon alexa not the app that is on the instructions.
21803,14,"this is a great techy gadget for a family. my kids play games, do homework, set timers. i can play all of my amazon music playlists, and listen all through my house - the sound is awesome.my only complaint, sometimes the volume is up and alexa can not hear you, forcing us to run and use the volume buttons. sometimes the volume is too low, still trying to find a good number -5-7 possibly."
21804,9,i bought 3 echos & 2 dots at best buy for black friday. i love alexa. this is the best purchase ever. i love that can be used as an intercom.
21805,11,works perfectly and much nicer looking in my home.1st generation echo is now in my gym room.both work well.
21806,14,has worked for all of three times in the months i¡¯ve had it. keeps shorting out and it is not my wifi ( i¡¯ve tested ) not a good choice. i¡¯m so disappointed !
21807,14,still trying to figure out why its more than a glorified alarm clock.
21808,0,alexa does not know jack. i am quite disappointed.  the google home answers all of the questions alexa can not answer.
21809,14,"except for time, weather and alarm everything else i tried to activate on the echo took a telephone call to amazon to get it working.  the siri on my computer gives me more info than alexa does.  when i asked how old van johnson was alexa told me 101.  he actually died 9 years ago at age 92.  i think more improvements need to be made."
21810,0,i thought it was going to be smarter. it is not.  it is not connect d to the internet and can not answer basic questions. good for playing music and forecast and setting timer but not worth paying 100 dollars for.  siri is way smarter
21811,14,excellent sound and ir is almost like having another person in the room.  alexa responds as soon as i speak to her.
21812,11,"i have to say, the 1st generation to me has a better microphone and speaker package. the new 2nd generation has a beautiful new design which was my reason to upgrade but still lacks in the better sound quality i was looking for. not worth the upgrade if you already have a amazon echo but i do like the direction amazon is going for the new design and functionality. keep it up echo team!"
21813,9,"im in love with alexa.you must have heard good thingd about her, there are many like her but this one is mine."
21814,14,"wish it had a ring to control the volume like first generation, not these dumb buttons you can not see in dim light."
21815,11,i have the amazon echo and i feel the sound quality on my amazon echo sounds so much better than amazon echo 2nd.
21816,14,"can not handle simple commands like ""turn all the lights off."" mostly just tells you she can not do stuff, like siri but $100. do not know how everyone got conned into this. the last straw were the super-invasive ads built-in! never again will i allow an amazon product into my home. blew it, guys. and do not believe these ratings, look at the app store ratings to see how people really feel lol."
21817,14,"well after a while finally got it hooked up,was tough at first and the plans are a little high for listening to music."
21818,11,"i must admit i was hoping for better sound from the new speakers, i believe the original sounds much better.  i do love the ability to stream in a group."
21819,14,i was wanting a speaker for my computer.  this is for alexa and smart home.  not just a bluetooth speaker.
21820,14,a fun toy that has far too much of its functionality dependent upon a smartphone app.  it is really unfortunate that so many of this device is features are inaccessible through amazon is website or through the device itself.
21821,14,"purchased one each for my daughters, ages 3 and 5. not many songs available unless you purchase amazon music. purchased additional $3.99 monthly amazon music. they cannot stream their own individual music at the same time. additional monthly amazon music must be purchased for each device in your home. i do not see the point in having more than one in your home. in addition, alexa does not seem to understand the simplest requests such as, 'children is music'. there is not a whole lot of parental control available for the echo either. returning and going with another product instead."
21822,14,i never could get it to work for me so i sent it back. it was probably me.
21823,14,"yes, i saw the other reviews and asked myself ""could the sound quality really be all that bad?"".  then i saw they fixed it!  mine has been plugged in overnight and it sounds like a echo dot with too much bass.  if i could only turn down the bass.  i love the look and design.  too bad it falls short on sound quality."
21824,14,the original echo and echo dot seem to have the best microphones. all the gen2 echos have not been listening well to me.
21825,1,great sound and functionality. a lot of fun.
21826,14,can not hook up to wifi there is no help available.  the few suggestions on the instructions are not helpful
21827,14,it would not connect to wifi so i returned it after speaking to customer support.
21828,11,i love my echos. this was an upgrade from my dot. the speaker is much better. it is also very attractive.
21829,14,"having fun so far....lots to learn!  we do not use smart phones, so used my amazon fire 10"" tablet to set up my echo.  now i can get to sleep with some soothing classical music and have it play the length of time  that i want. i have asked some questions, and liked the quick response. need to learn the key words to access some of the skills that i enabled.  will update when we have used alexa more, but so far it is great!update:  i was able to request my favorite classical music piece in the night last night, and ooooooh it was nice!  soothing, and helped me get back to sleep.  yeah!  now if i can get the sleep timer figured out!got it!  ask alexa for the music i want, then when it starts playing, ask alexa to set sleep timer for the amount that i want. she responds and agrees.we are using alexa to give us reminders of times to take medications.....big help and so easy!now i can set up a ""repeating alarm"" for the times per day every day that they are needed.  no more missed meds or blood sugar checks!"
21830,9,"what a fun and awesome tool for the home! got it as a gift for my husband, such a good addition. the echo is easy to use, functional, and is already improving my life."
21831,14,never could get mine to connect to the internet.  had to send back.  might try another version later.
21832,11,"have had first generation echo for awhile now and love it. though i was not expecting an extraordinary difference, i really could not detect the advertised improvement in sound quality. that is the reason for the mediocre rating. otherwise, like the original echo it does what it does and does it well."
21833,14,speaker is outstanding.  easy to operate and to learn.  no complaints.  i have enabled to play podcast skill.  takes a little bit to for it to understand but it works well.
21834,14,the echo will consistently ignore whatever i ask it do. it took 15 minutes for my echo to recognize that i wanted it to play fan sounds before i went to bed. i do not recommend spending anything more than 20 for such a faulty device.
21835,14,"device works but cannot use kindle fire tablet to fully control it. alexa keeps asking me to register in the alexa app. however, to register you need the conversation icon which is not part of the app in the tablet. you require a smart phone."
21836,14,after three days since i got it i have to scream at it to wake up. it is very nerve racking. fifty percent of the time it works but that is not enough for me and i know i will get tired of it in another week and return it cause i am getting hoarse from shouting at it and i do not understand all the rave reviews.
21837,14,speaker vibrates due to bass on songs with strong bass.
21838,8,i love it .works great.
21839,14,"the first generation plays louder and clearer , than the second generation. when is amazon going to make a portable charger for the new echo. i brought one for the first and love it but it only last 3-4 hours ."
21840,4,the new echo.i like it a lot. easy to setup. easy to use.very helpful!
21841,14,i¡¯d like to rate it higher but i¡¯ve not been able to determine what additional items i need to do the things advertised such as turn on/ off lights. about all this does now is give me the time and temperature
21842,14,"we liked it for music requests and a game or two, however we got frustrated when trying to end, stop, quit, cancel....etc any function than alexa was not the most user friendly."
21843,14,have not used like i thought i would. i have a 4 level house and have place on main floor.  do not have things that connects to echo have just used with pandora radio while i¡¯m in area.  i also own a bose link that links to my music on my phone.
21844,14,"i like the ease of use, but the ""echo"" sound (no pun intended lol) would be better if we could add bass.... i have stumped alexa, :) but overall satisfied with the collection of tunes, local and international radio shows. i do not like having to pay for the service when we are prime members.  :(  that will most likely be our reason to return."
21845,14,"just what can i not do with you...yeah you alexa! echo ii awesome, i am still working on adding more products to my voice service, soon i will not be touching a thing in my house...."
21846,14,"i bought a third echo entirely for amazon is claim that it sync is with other echo is in other rooms.  it does not do it for me. have not decided whether to return.  i suspect amazon will eventually get it to work, but not right now.  otherwise i am happy with my old echo and dot which are in different houses"
21847,9,"my friend received one as a gift, and i liked it so much i decided to wait for the 2nd generation. could not be happier! love it!"
21848,14,"it has a lot of potential. however the way that it was shipped to me there were few wvery few directions, i¡¯m still flabbergasted /fascinated  relative to this  piece of technology . you  indicated there were a lot of applications and i¡¯m committed to learning how to use them the jury is out and i hope i got times. incidentally , tell jessica and lisa thanks"
21849,14,"does the job i want. do not expect great sound from it. the little guy is good; if you want to add logitech gear to it for $35, you are ahead."
21850,14,"this echo would not connect with my wif. my 2 phones , and tv are connected , kinda disappointed in the hype about this product."
21851,0,"having fun with her , i  just met her, we need some time to get what she knows. ,.more than myself lol"
21852,7,"i love the sound that comes out of the echo, but very very disappointed with it. only 10% of the time can i get it do something. alexa says i do not understand  try again later!<f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+00a3>"
21853,10,a great device. controls my lights and tell me the weather when i say good morning. love it!!! worth the money.
21854,14,"so far, i must give it zero stars!  i had to give it one star in order to send my review.  i have tried to set it up at least a dozen times since christmas to no avail.  the device keeps telling me my wifi code is wrong.  it is not wrong!  i have checked it several times, as has my wife.  the code has been successfully used by us and our guests."
21855,9,my first echo and love it. easy to set up and sounds great. can ask a question from anywhere in my apartment. great buy
21856,14,"worst most frustrating thing in my house ,and now it is gone ."
21857,14,lame! too complicated to set up. two days later i just sent it back! got me a bose instead. much happier!
21858,14,we can not connect to our internet. called our provider with no success. product will be returned. not sure if its the product or internet connection. never had this issue with our high speed.
21859,0,"i was excited to buy an echo. i imagined all the things it would do. sad to say it does not do much but say ""i do not know"". i have added skills and looked to see what it can do, i do not know if i have not figured it out or what. i wish i would have bought a google instead and i probably will anyway. sad i wasted my money."
21860,10,"the new echo sounds great and looks great. i love having alexa in every room. at a moments notice anywhere in my house i can play music, enjoy an audiobook, take a quiz, get a news update, set a timer, turn on my lights, and even call my parents. i was initially skeptical about the echo but it has truly become an indispensable tool in my life."
21861,14,received as a gift for christmas. overall it is a nice addition to various gadgets we have but the speakers are not as good as my $30 bluetooth speakers. wish that the speakers were better.
21862,11,"the echo 2 sounds about the same as the echo 1, in my personal opinion. you are pretty much paying $80 less for the aesthetics of the fabrics and other finishes of the new, shorter echo 2 speaker"
21863,14,i have to reset it every few days.
21864,14,"they make it sound like plug and play, not.good luck! i returned it."
21865,0,i have google home and this device is worse thn it. i often ask alexa a question and she ignores it where google home will respond if it cannot understand it. i bought the home also and it will answer calls but echo makes it u usable.
21866,10,"i bought smart plug  connect to our christmas light, connected to alexa, it works for turning on. i hope it works with turning off also. what i love about it is, i can play music and make a call. overall i love it!"
21867,0,"alexa is not very smart & needs to know more.  i wish i would of bought the google, it is smarter."
21868,14,"great, once up and running.  i would like to see training videos specific to 2nd generation.  rules and advice for echo1 do not apply to echo 2 (e.g., reset button, power disconnect, etc.)"
21869,11,"i replaced my first gen echo dot with the new 2nd gen echo,  hoping to get a much superior  sound quality experience, but regret to say amazon dropped the ball here as the sound is awful. it is louder but does not mean the echo delivers quality sound like the google alternative does. do not waste you money."
21870,0,"same alexa, i love but better soundingme:- what can i do for you alexa?alexa:- great! , i have an assistant nowclassic"
21871,14,"this things listens to everything you say and is directly linked to amazon, big brother is here in 2018!"
21872,14,love having this in our home.  we had a bit of trouble trying to add two accounts to amazon but finally figured it out
21873,11,the size and design is nice. and the interchangeable covers are nice. but i also own the 1st gen and it has a noticeably richer bottom end. (bass)im not sure if the 2nd gen has smaller diameter speakers but ot sounds like it.
21874,0,it dosent do what you ask
21875,11,no use for it. sending it back. extremely poor quality sound.
21876,14,sorry echo you continue to disappoint me when i compare you to my google mini
21877,14,does not connect to my spotify or pandora account. had to make monthly subscription to amazon music just to play music. sending it back asap.
21878,14,"i took the device out of the box, plugged it in, got the app, and was not able to sign in.  it kept freezing up and not letting me complete entering my password.  i can not figure out what to do next, can not figure out how to get amazon on the phone.  customer service should be better than this. :("
21879,10,i think alexa is sick she plays one song and stop like she getting tired
21880,14,"if your looking for a voice activated service that is easy to use and expandable, this is it."
21881,11,i feel like the last one was better. if you listen to the actual radio on it this one is not for you. the sound quality on listening to the radio is mufflers and poor. if you have it hooked up to amazon radio the sound is clear. still love the device. just disappointed wish i would of bought the older version.
21882,14,not happy with product; returned to store for credit.
21883,14,"sucks. too many instruction to connect with alexa.( when the wifi is lost) - repeat again to connect with alexa. you have to do this, blah blah blah."
21884,14,"the echo device is very nice. just forget trying to get it to play apple music or get help from their (purposely) outdated ""help"" page. what would make the echo really great would be to have it work with other music (that i own). solid electronics and bose sound. no customer support."
21885,0,"none of it works as advertised.  constantly needs something done to keep it connected to wifi or internet access,  and her standard answer for everything; sorry i do not know that."
21886,0,i like all the features and more. i like the interaction with alexa.
21887,9,"we had the small one,and now use this one.the sound quality and volumeis so much better ! we love it......."
21888,0,alexa can not stand my accent - she does not like me - returned
21889,11,"works as advertised, still not sure if its more novelty than functional though."
21890,7,amazon never disappoints. incredible sound. compliments my echo show beautifully. do not hesitate to purchase the echo!<u+2764><u+fe0f>
21891,14,"i have 4 echo is.  i really do love them all.  i love the look of this new echo because i think the fabric is pretty cool.  i was expecting the sound to be better than my previous model, but i really do not notice a difference.  i have received the push to the updated software.  however, guys, this echo is only $100!  it is totally worth it.  the first generation was $180.00.  so, if this is your first echo, you will love it.  this is an excellent product for an outstanding price.  some reviewers should really take that into consideration.  and because of that, it is deserving of 5 stars.if you have the previous model, you might be a little disappointed.  amazon, "" who is idea was it to remove the turn dial for volume???? ""  bring it back when you upgrade to the 3rd.  it is a great feature and one that i can not believe you removed."
21892,10,"bought for my wife, she is just learning its many functions."
21893,14,after about 2 weeks of struggling i finally got it to connect
21894,10,excellent product which is easily set up and put into use.
21895,14,"i had problems setting it,. probably my fault. i had someone set it up, including connecting it to my phone. i am enjoying it a lot!  the thought of creating a ""smart house "" is exciting, but that would cost a lot, including the cost of having someone set it uo. i would bet that the average user would have a lot of trouble doing it themself."
21896,11,not impressed at all with the 2nd generation! save your money
21897,14,"this is my 3rd echo, good sound but can only stream in one room at a time or make another account."
21898,11,an upgraded version on my echo dot.  works just as well but better sound.
21899,14,i bought the echo as a gift and ever since i gave it away i have been charged for amazon music. i even canceled the subscription twice and i still get charged. idk why amazon has the right to connect my card to an item i gave away as a gift. figure it out amazon your a big company handle your technical issues.
21900,11,still have several of the gen 1 devices - and they are great - but the gen 2 devices sound is far superior!
21901,0,alexa is not overly friendly but she answers your questions.
21902,1,this speaker is really good! good sound and we looooove alexa!
21903,14,so far i must give only 2 stars.  maybe more later.  taco a day i have to reinstall in order for voice activation to work properly.  to obtain notifications it advise to load some google app which i will not do.  do not want any part of google apps.thanks and more later
21904,11,"very poor audio quality. i was very much looking forward to this product and bought a few of them - they have all been returned. sound quality is a step backwards from the original. removal of volume ring at the top of the device is a mistake. as a customer of amazon is since 1999, i am very surprised they would release such a poor quality product (while marketing it as a new and improved version....)"
21905,14,"i am offended that it is programmed that it only allows me to listen to ""liberal"" views based talk radio.  you pay enough for this product that should have the choice to listen to what you want and not be tied to a particular political viewpoint..  not right amazon!"
21906,14,alexa is taking over my house.. i have 2 echos and 3 dots..
21907,0,"alexa is fun to play with but the background  intelligence  is lacking.  alexa is answer to  a lot of questions  is ""i do not know"".  would be a lot  better with more in-depth programming."
21908,11,"i suppose the echo can play louder than the echo dot, but i cannot tell any difference in the sound quality between the new echo and the echo dot.  the first generation is echo sound quality is noticeably better than the new version."
21909,0,it is works great but it does not allow every single song
21910,14,"perfect companion on the house, good item to get"
21911,14,i love her!! just as great as my first echo & ready to take up her spot in our other home. i did not think alexa needed any improvement truthfully.
21912,14,"sounds like crap.... rather have the echo dot than this. wasted money. really disappointed and even angry. i feel rooked!i must add, after a few days, i have received a call frrom amazon customer service. they recognize the issues and are actively working toward improving this product. i am hopeful they will be able to. stay tuned, i quess. at least they have responded. that is a good tbing in my book.some weeks later.okay, after a conversation and an upgrade or two, the sound is much better... they surprised me. a long question and answer call which amazon initiated and my review must change... very happy with my purchase!still sometime later, while i am happy with the product after the fixes, a better choice is a dog with the new boss resolve 360 portable speaker if you want good rich sound and a small speaker."
21913,14,"received this as a gift.  it stopped working completely today.  it worked ok for awhile, then slowly got worse. now there are many complaints about frequent outages with no response back from amazon."
21914,14,very limited usage other than getting the weather report or creating a shopping list (and alexa does not quite get that right either) and occasional ability to answer a request for information on a topic. very disappointing - a frivolous waste of money.
21915,11,"this is an amazing device. it is very responsive, works well even in loud rooms, and has a great sound. my only issue is that it is wired. i would love a unit a similar size that worked off of a rechargeable battery."
21916,14,"alexa refuses to remember my name and can only perform basic functions, can not do over %80 of what is asked"
21917,9,"purchased for my mother in law, excited to see if she loves it as much as we do"
21918,14,a novelty that spies on you.  it does do a good alec trebec though
21919,10,"like it, parents enjoy the voice assistant"
21920,14,lack of music upload capability a huge shortcoming. very disappointed.
21921,10,"the only thing this is good for is playing music, asking what time it is, asking what the temperature is, asking the age/birth date/death date of famous people.  any other questions are too complicated for it to process."
21922,9,absolutely love! i cannot live without.
21923,12,it is been fun and still learning things alexa can do.
21924,14,"not very happy with echo, did not answer 8 out 10 questions asked, no help at all, would not recommend echo, extremly dissappointedand would return it if i could!!!!!"
21925,11,"nice unit, but the sound is not as good as expected"
21926,11,"we like our 2nd gen echo, but the lack of portability, going cordless, has left us a bit disappointed.  overall very fun and useful. sound quality is better than we expected."
21927,14,was able to purchase more then one without searching.
21928,9,a much appreciated gift that is used!
21929,14,"bought this as my second echo. warning - only one echo can play using prime account. so when i turn on the new one, the original can not play music - without buying a subscription. i bought it early before christmas and now it is too late to return. garbage!"
21930,14,"i bought this hoping for much improved sound for playing standalone.  i¡¯m really disappointed.  it sounds like the dot i replaced.  might be better at listening.  nice looking.  easy to set up.  needs some bass.  sounds raspy.  may return it.  price was nice.  update november 4th.  amazon reached out to me and helped download latest software.  i think it is been pushed out to all.  it helped.  still disappointed, i had ¡°bose¡± like expectations when i saw dolby.  hats off to a for being proactive."
21931,1,:)
21932,0,"nice, have not often used it yet"
21933,9,"i did not purchase this from amazon because i had a gift card from another merchant, however i love...love....love it. i wished that i could have purchased a couple for friends but they do not have wifi."
21934,0,"echo is great, works well. the only problem i have is certain questions have to be asked the correct way or you do not get an answer"
21935,14,"not able to perform ""drop-in"" feature...i am unable to download alexa app to pc or laptop...do not have smart phone!while submitting initial order, there was an offer of a free dot unit with two 2nd generation units being ordered the site would not accept the code provided. would amazon honor that for me?"
21936,14,"great item for the family, just started using it so i do not have a lot to offer in the way of advice but so far we have i running the  thermostat and a few lights. set up was very easy and the sound quality of the unit is very good with speech and music."
21937,9,suprised my wife for christmas and we both really like it.
21938,7,not real pleased with echo.  alexa often does not have the answer... whereas when we go to google on our phones we get the answer <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0090>
21939,14,my husband and i have had a lot of fun thinking of music from our past(and that goes back a long way}to see if we could find something that alexa did not have at her fingertips  so far we have not found many songs that could not be played in a few seconds and we have enjoyed that.
21940,1,love it! amazon music is the best!
21941,14,nice upgrade to the old echo.
21942,0,having a difficult time getting the apps to cooperate.  there needs to be a tutorial for dummies!
21943,14,no battery. my bad.
21944,2,met all my expectations
21945,3,works great just as i expected
21946,14,great sound from this tower! never had any type of device previously.  would highly recommend this to everyone.
21947,12,really enjoying this item !
21948,10,"i love this thing  it is easy to use i can check the weather,scores and listen  to music really quick without having to go through my phone i highly recommend this product"
21949,10,"my wife bought me it for an anniversary gift and i am surprised i get so much use out of it.  listen to podcasts at my desk now, listen to music, ask dumb questions, as well as get use out of a plethora of the skills.5/5 would be gifted it again.seriously though the things pretty neat."
21950,12,keep finding new uses
21951,12,love this thing. i have figured out some of it but still have lots to learn. i would recommend this to anyone. it is fun and easy to use!
21952,5,gift for my son in law
21953,9,"brought one earlier, it is great! these are for xmas gifts."
21954,5,gave it as a gift and i love it.
21955,0,i really do not like the fact that it listens to everything.
21956,12,works just so so
21957,14,"bought on a whim, but have continued to learn new skills to use it for."
21958,3,yes exactly as listed
21959,0,exremly difficult
21960,9,"perfect, sound quality is very good for something so small.  very responsive, fun to play around with and so far works just as i hoped.  already bought 2 dots and another echo for my home so everyone has one in the home.  working on building our smarthome."
21961,11,liked the volume on the old echo
21962,11,the best speaker
21963,11,"we had to replace a gen 1 echo that was stolen.  i was excited that this new echo has dolby sound.  it is much richer than the gen 1.  and, the smaller size is nice as well."
21964,11,had great difficulty getting the echo/alexa app.
21965,2,love my echo
21966,14,"i love the sound and look, but shipping did not arrive on time as my prime membership tracker told me it would. if i am paying for that premium i think it should be upheld. but once we did get it we had some great fun with the music tricia app with the whole family and many of its other great features."
21967,2,love the new sound
21968,0,"it is not only useful and entertaining, but a whole lot of fun."
21969,14,"good for playing music from my prime music library. for everything from spelling (and understanding words) to directions, my google home mini is better.  for instance, this device calls streets by their number (hwy 41) instead of their common name (dixie hwy). i do not know numbers.  also, you have to teach this thing ""skills"" which already seem to be built into the home. one example is scheduling events or reminders. quick 'n easy on home. another painfully drawn out process ""skill"" for alexa."
21970,14,"for example, i have an amazon music unlimited family subscription at $14.99 a month.  can i add a playlist from my music unlimited account to my echo -nope?  amazon charges an additional $3.99 per device to use the amazon unlimited service on the echo.  so if i want to listen to amazon unlimited at work, and at home and the three echo devices i purchase as christmas presents i have to pay 29.96 a month.  no thank you.  i will wait until apple releases the homepod.  for 14.99 a month i can stream apple music to an unlimited number airplay or homepod devices."
21971,14,i love my echo. alexa tells the best worst jokes.
21972,1,"great product, good sound quality"
21973,14,i love the new echo.  the only thing i was dissapointed with is that fact that she has to stay plugged in.  i thought she was chargeable and i could move her without a power chord.  i am overly satisfied with her though and would not get rid of her for that reason.
21974,10,my fave products
21975,2,love my alexa
21976,11,i like the echo very much.
21977,14,my 3rd 0ne
21978,11,much better audio than my dot.
21979,9,enjoyed
21980,9,"yes we love the echo 2nd generation.  we are having so much fun with it and everyday we find new things to do.  we bought one early november,2017 for our son and his wife and they really enjoy it.  in fact they are going to order some echo dots for other rooms in their home."
21981,11,good
21982,14,does not really do much or add to our everyday lives.  already owned sonos so the music did not add to our household.  about all we get it to do is tell is the weather and trivia.  got that on my phone.  we have had to re upload it once and we have only had it 3 months.
21983,14,"i bought the tap when it is on sale, not knowing it is being discontinued by amazon.  now this new 2nd generation echo just came out, i wanted to try it because the sound is provided by dolby.  it does have better bass and it is more bulky.  i am most unhappy about it not having a built-in battery because i am so used to using tap, with the quick charge stand and built-in battery, i can take it anywhere with me true portability.  this echo requires constant plug, which is a poor design in my opinion. also, there is no previous or next button.  it take some getting used to.  i also think the different color or finish sleeve at $20 premium is a bit stiff.  under $10 would have been reasonable."
21984,8,love
21985,12,gift
21986,11,"good sound quality, more sensitive microphone. did not like losing the volume adjustment ring on top. because of this change i¡¯ll be replacing my genii echo with another 1st gen unit."
21987,14,"arrived yesterday and have been using it ever since. others have noted dissatisfaction with the audio quality, however to me it sounds just fine although i do not have the first echo to compare it to in terms of audio. other reviews online have said it either sounds about the same as the first echo or that there is now a slight improvement with the echo 2, so not sure what the audio quality issues are that others here have noted in their reviews."
21988,1,the sound is very clear.
21989,14,"ordered the new 2nd generation echo with ""improved sound"" big old nope. does not sound even 80% as good as the original echo. not sure what you guys are doing to test sound quality, and i realize this is subjective...but this thing sounds worse than the first generation does, which actually sounded pretty great for a little plastic tube. i rarely write reviews, i am not a complainer...but i am a bit of an audio nerd. was a musician and producer for 30 years. sound quality matters to me. i have spent the last hour or so listening to various songs on this new echo and the original one. the original simply blows it out of the water. thinking i am going to send this back and order a refurbished 1st generation. it is significantly better sounding. you guys missed the mark. maybe go back and really listen to this ""new"" echo right next to the old one and i am sanguine anyone with even average hearing will be able to hear a marked, ok...massive...difference."
21990,12,getting use to using it. so far so good!
21991,1,really nice sound. fills room with music
21992,11,very different sound than the larger version.
21993,12,i do not like it !
21994,14,had to return it. did not work...
21995,1,none
21996,1,"amazing, very smart device"
21997,11,"does all it is suppose so do.  sound is a large improvement over the dot, but still does not provide great music sound  when compared to the bose revolve."
21998,14,"no instructions for set up  you go through the entire setup, and then find out that the device is not registered, and there are no instructions on how to register it. why do not they tell you that it has to be registered first?  i will never buy any electronics from amazon again."
21999,14,"i bought the triple pack with 50$ rebate.i already have two echo 1. gen and two dots.i am very satisfied with the sound quality of the 1. gen.the product discretion says the sound quality has been improved.i am not an audiophile person, but after seconds i noticed the sound quality has become considerably worse.in my opinion 50 % better than a dot, but also 50% worse compares to my 1. gen.the new design is an improvement but the sound is very disappointing.unfortunately my wife discarded all packages, so i guess i can not return all three echo is. ( will contact costumer service )i definitely miss more depth, right now it sounds tinny.i have one 1. gen and one 2. gen in one room and switched between both 30-40 times with different music types and annoy me again and again.maybe amazon will provide an equalizer in the settingsplease!!!!!!!review update:amazon reacted immediately and fixed the sound issue with an software update.the costumer service called me twice the next day to let me know and asked if i noticed a difference.yes, the difference is like day and night."
22000,0,"when i changed my internet, it stopped woirking"
22001,14,"the echo stops playing music after a short while. when i ask alexa why the music stopped, she tells me to consult the app."
22002,14,"disappointed with the microphone reception on this device. i have three echo dots which work flawlessly. i have used self-help tips from amazon to troubleshoot the device for the past three weeks. i contacted amazon 3 days ago to request help, and they asked me to factory reset the device. i did so today, and noticed no difference. i reached amazon today asking for a refund or replacement. we concluded together the microphones were defective, and i was advised he would look into options for a refund. after what felt like a 5 plus minute hold, i was told they would submit this to ""the developers"", and would follow up with me sometime later this week. maybe my expectations are a little too high for customer service, but i am very disappointed with the response i have received today from the support team. i have 3 more echo devices in my shopping cart, but i will be rethinking getting those if this is the response i can expect to receive from their support staff. is it just me, or is the amazon customer service for digital devices atrocious?edit: after leaving my review above, nick from amazon contacted me back. after admitting this was not handled correctly, we found a suitable resolution. that experience left me happy, but cost amazon more money than had this been handled correctly the first time. i hope amazon considers coaching the digital device support teams to better serve their customers. the advisor i had earlier today was great, but did not know how to help me."
22003,14,"alexa is not program for the caribbean country, so you have to be repeating yourself and half of the apps and site can not be reached because i am not in the us."
22004,14,must play all the same music. not helpful for my application. i needed individual control for each area. returned.
22005,10,love my echo. it jas great sound and alexa is very kind.
22006,14,"first time owning one, so was not sure what to expect. super simple to set up and use. clear, great sound for music. alexa can hear and understand me from another room, even with my 2 large dogs playing with squeaky toys and rough housing in the background!!"
22007,0,not working right
22008,12,havent been able to use so far.
22009,9,"honestly, my favorite new piece of tech."
22010,14,it does not work and i¡¯m going to send it back
22011,3,it will not work
22012,11,i like the new form factor but was disappointed by the sound quality. i expected a deeper bass with this upgrade but it does not sound any different than prior model. <u+2639><u+fe0f>
22013,11,i like having the volume control on the top. the speakers sound great.
22014,9,gave  this to my 10 year daughter for xmas.  she never uses it.
22015,11,looks great. sounds awesome. much better than echo dot. worth it for sound quality.
22016,8,we love alexa!
22017,14,quit working after two months.
22018,14,she cannot understand my english. she cannot speak japanese. i build a smart home which is completely useless. i need to improve my english accent :(
22019,9,i bought the new echo 2nd generation for my husbands birthday and he love is it! we both do! :) i highly recommend this product.
22020,11,enjoy it very much
22021,14,we bought the echo for my daughter and it was great until she got scared with the laughing on its own when she was home alone and now will not use it.  i am wondering how amazon is going to fix it and push it out to the devices in the field.
22022,11,better than expected but can not compare against the predecessor because i did not own the originals. massive improvement over the dot for most music.
22023,3,the sound was not as good as i thought it would be
22024,14,sound great.  love it.take a few try before connect to wifi.but love the sound.  great for playing music.
22025,9,it never worked. bought as a gift for my boyfriend and it would not connect to his wifi so he could never set it up.
22026,14,"love it!but not quite the quality of my bose dock station speaker. but also not the same in cost, bose being 3x is more.  on the other side of that bose does not have internet access or the ability to answer my difficult questions. lol"
22027,14,"i guess when a company gets too big, they do not care about quality anymore. this is in no way improved sound. this sounds so horrible, i will return both of them. imagine a crappy, cheap tiny speaker installed in a tin can (and then make it sound even worse than that) anybody who tells you this sounds good, has absolutely no clue what they are talking about! avoid this failed product and look for something else."
22028,11,"the sound quality could be better. the jbl is is much better. but it is ok, do their job."
22029,0,"i find it difficult to use, it does not sync easily and it laughs for no reason... creepy"
22030,10,love the quality sound. use it to listen to iheartradio. recommend as the top electronic of the year.
22031,11,a much improved sound over the echo dot. same alexa capability with a much better sound.
22032,11,was not happy with the sound and the sound was easier turn louder on the old echo.  now there are buttons to push.
22033,1,good quality sound.
22034,14,"i was very disappointed in echo when i try to get it to respond to commands it would not do it and i gave it every chance that i possibly one could give ,  and i am a big supporter of amazon but i am seriously considering getting the apple homepod"
22035,8,love it!!
22036,10,luv it!!! luv it!!  i feel like a kid playing with my toy!!
22037,14,"we have had an echo for a few years now. it is quickly become an essential member of our home. home just is not quite home anymore without alexa <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+008c>the new echo is a wonderful second edition on the original! great audio quality, build quality and aesthetic appearance. i really like the fabric wrap.hitting that $100 price point is unbeatable too!great job, again, amazon!"
22038,2,alexa echo is awesome!!
22039,0,it takes two or three times of saying something in order for the darn echo to do what is being asked to do.
22040,11,functions like old one except volume control which totally sucks
22041,0,"very disappointed, alexa does not answer most of my questions, which are not very difficult"
22042,14,does not work as good as the old oneshas hard time finding smart devices. took it out of main room.
22043,3,i did not order this?
22044,1,i really like the crisp balance
22045,14,glorified bluetooth speaker. nothing that can not be done with a smart phone and a speaker
22046,14,"good, lovely and great. customer service us wonderful.except that i never received my order and amazon ignore my support request."
22047,0,having some issues with it turning off music.  must be very close for it to hear you.
22048,1,amazing little device.
22049,11,"if this product was portable it would get a four star.  the sound is great at a medium volume, but at a higher volume not that much better in my opinion than the tap."
22050,14,continually looses the internet connection. i have to keep reconnecting. my internet is high speed with a very strong signal. none of my other electronic devices ever loose the internet connection even when my echo does.
22051,14,great speaker perfect playing music.  if you have prime its a must have if you listen to music.
22052,14,"the echo did well with most requests for music and the likes. it does not have an onboard battery, so when there is no a/c power, there is no echo. i think the manufacturer needs to incorporate a rechargeable power source in the device."
22053,2,dope
22054,14,"11/1/17i guess when a company gets too big, they do not care about quality anymore. this is in no way improved sound. this sounds so horrible, i return both of them. imagine a crappy, tiny speaker installed in a tin can (and then make it sound even worse than that) anybody who tells you this sounds good, has absolutely no clue what they are talking about! also the time it takes for echo to respond is longer than with the original echo. avoid this failed product and look for something else.11/3/17amazon had the nerve to contact me and claim (quote) ""we did a software update this morning that should have it sounding great""yes, there was an update and yes it sounds a little different, but certainly not better at all! i guess amazon is hoping to fool even more people in believing that this is acceptable sound, which it is not. false claims and advertisement x2!"
22055,8,fantastic sound! it really works great. love it!!
22056,14,"does not work as advertised. more often than not the echo does not understand my inputs. basic requests like ""play x playlist on spotify"" often result in no actions being taken by the device. spotify support is horrible, when playing music it will just stop. the spotify app says the music is still playing but it certainly is not. none of the updates have helped and i have seen several. even asking the device to stop playing music (i.e.: alexa pause) often does not stop the music.i should have returned the item but was just too focused on other things. now i am stuck with it and would trade it in at any point."
22057,14,great product at a great price.
22058,1,love the sound
22059,0,"so far not so good. it would work for a while and then it would  say "" having trouble connecting to your internet "" i have restarted it 5 times and each time it would give the same problem."
22060,9,"love the echo! it is the best ""gadget"" i bought in 2017. can not wait to see what comes next!"
22061,14,very hard to coordinate this with other services such as pandora etc. not happy!!
22062,2,great new echo
22063,14,"it took a day for it to stream music without interruption, but since then it seems fine.so far, so good. now i have to start thinking of all the good tasks i can send to the echo..."
22064,14,not as easy to set up music files as indicated. fails to answer most questions.
22065,14,"echo 2nd generation stopped powering up one month after using it. warranty should be longer for such an expensive product, very disappointed in amazon product. yes, i have gone through troubleshooting options with no results."
22066,14,unable to connect to most of my home devices. spent the evening trying to make things work.
22067,14,gave a middle rating because i bought as a gift for my husband & he did not want it.
22068,9,works as expected; love having one in the bedroom to access just like the one in the family room.
22069,0,"disappointed that even though we have prime, we still are very limited in her music selection"
22070,4,love it and so easy to set up
22071,14,i am very disappointed in this product. all the hype and advertising got me wanting it and it rarely works. it constantly has connectivity issues and cannot understand commands. it is just a glorified amplifier and speaker!
22072,0,it has not worked right since we bought it at christmas. it starts to play a song and stops and skips part of it and sometimes starts again. certainly not what we expected. have not used it since.cant recommend buying one.
22073,12,"i have only used it a few times, i still have a lot to learn about this device."
22074,12,i like it.
22075,10,"works great  for my spelling corrections, and to call phone numbers"
22076,11,the shear sixe alone is what i love and the charcoal  texture is the best. once again a grest product from amazon
22077,14,just wish i did not have to sign up for prime to get music.
22078,0,i am a disappointed that echo does not have a lot more answers. i find that i¡¯m using my phone to access wikipedia almost as much as before. i do like the music application.
22079,14,"i am completely unable to connect to my wi-fi. of course, by the time i got around to seriously trying to hook it up, it was after my 30 day return period. the instructions to hook up to wi-fi kept urging me to use my app on my phone. i forgot that my phone did have a wifi hookup to my home system. so, i did not want to use the app because i did not understand how it was trying to hook up to my home wi-fi system through my phone. eventually, i realized that my phone was hooked up to my home wi-fi system, and that echo wanted to use my phone to hook up to that system. that was after about 1-1/2 hours. it would be nice if amazon explained how the hook up worked, rather than just telling what to do to hookup. once i realized i had to hook up through my phone, i followed the instructions, but alexa told me it was unable to hook up. have not yet seen contact info for anyone i can talk to to remedy the problem.the online solutions do not help. what a piece of junk. will not buy anymore of these products (nor their relatives) from amazon"
22080,9,"<u+00a0>this is great!  my son has autism and he loves alexa reminding him.  it has great sound too.  so if you want to listen to music, it is great too."
22081,0,it is only good for music and reminders; so fat has not been able to answer any question.  keeps saying i do not know.
22082,0,i do like the simple things i  can do with it like play music and start timers for cooking but i think it lacks knowledge on some questions i come up with.
22083,14,slowest echo i¡¯ve ever encountered. at first i though it was my internet but after numerous tests i realized it was the echo. took the time for it to learn my voice and it still does not understand me half of the time.
22084,0,"have to subscribe to amazon music or have prime to get music i want, but otherwise, it works fine"
22085,14,second one i am buying and it is defective.tired of them
22086,10,alexa...tell me a story....alexa...rap for me...alexa...do my dishes....the sky is the limit with alexa...she great! !
22087,14,i love mine and i would advise anyone to make this purchase it is well worth it
22088,14,"not sure if i was suppose to get a remote with alexas echo, but i did not get one."
22089,14,"way too much bass.  and worse, no way to turn down the bass.  did amazon even bother to test this thing in the real world?  very disappointed.  i reccomend dot with external speaker."
22090,14,"update 3/21/18: the sleep sounds skill issue has been resolved! i can now play ""sleep & relaxation"" skill all night without any interruptions and also will play sleep sounds after playing a music service, without rebooting. finally, this is my favorite echo device.the sound quality is better than ever and i am experiencing no issues. i am planning on buying a couple more and retiring my 1st generation echos."
22091,11,love the new sound
22092,14,"i will break this device review down into it various abilities. but first a general overview:i was waiting for apple homepod to come on the market this december 2017 (i am in no hurry and i have a homekit system) but, apple delayed homepod to 2018 and then, i read that apple got totally caught off guard with alexa and google home. homepod was originally just a speaker and a side project by some apple audio buffs. they were not even thinking of a smart home assistant like alexa! apple is now very, very behind. sad for a top company. perhaps it is time for tim cook and joni ive to retire and bring on some new thinking. it seems more and more out of touch with innovation. (full disclosure: i am an apple fan and user since 1987. i want the company to innovate and make useful and simple products. but they are drifting off into fantasy industrial design land making more and more impractical things.)so, with apple out off this smart home device game, perhaps for years or forever, i researched the amazon and google options and decided either would work! but, alexa had a slight edge as it has been around longer (more ""apps"") and more options for devices to choose. also, google blew it and did not drop the price for the friday after thanksgiving like amazon did, days earlier. google *was* more expensive. they did drop to match<u+2014>on friday<u+2014>but, it was too late! amazon clearly is a better retailer and got the price jump, which makes sense.also, i had amazon prime already. so, i went with alexa.the next choice was which unit? spot, dot, echo? i decided to get the echo as i eventually saw it as a bedside alarm clock and speaker for the bedroom. but if i get any more of these devices for the home, it will be smaller and cheaper models for other rooms. (btw: dot and spot are too similar sounding and easy to mix up. spot, being newer, should have been named something different like droplet or orb.)right now, it sits in the dining room. this is most central and i can speak with a normal voice from one end of the house to the other but, a small room/office on the first floor is just blocked enough by some walls and a hall that, alexa cannot hear me. upstairs is out of range too. the home is small by most american sizes, about 1300 sq ft but common on the east coast of the u.s. two bedroom. 1.5 baths. more like a townhouse in size but more square rather then long or narrow. i probably need three devices. dr, office, and upstairs in the master bedroom.audiofor the price, it should be stereo. maybe include another echo ""tube"" that is just a speaker and links independently with this ""main"" unit. (the sonos one is an alexis smart speaker and you can buy two of them to be stereo but, as is the case, sonos charges way too much for what you get). regardless, the audio quality of the echo is very good except, like many speakers made for the u.s. market, way over bass loaded. i hope amazon adds in at least basic treble and bass controls *eventually*! (side note: some people also have hearing disabilities and this control of boosting or lowering bass or treble can help them very much! my father boosted the bass in his car stereo a lot [he would love this echo excess bass as is] due to hearing loss he had in wwii. me, my hearing loss is on the other end. i need to reduce the bass for at least 25-50% of its current level.)it is frustrating that the spotify only works if you are a spotify premium customer. tunein works ok. alexis struggled with ""linn classical"" and understood it as lynn classical but played a classical selection instead of the radio station. there is also linn jazz and just linn internet radio. these are all high quality hd audio stations that play on many devices from yamaha, to pioneer to tunein to apple tv radio apps. i have not tested pandora yet.hopefully, apple and amazon can agree to let apple music on echo too. just like amazon prime video will soon be on apple tv.appyou do a lot from the amazon alexa app. in my review, i will not refer to it separately. just think of it as the control panel that is missing from the speaker itself.in the set up of the echo, it tells you to download the app or, do the set up via the web page for echo. not really wanting to add another app (with low star ratings) to my ios devices, i opened safari on an ipad. but when you go to the alexis page (that they give you) it tells you to¡¦ download the app! this is really dumb. is no one at amazon app qc checking this stuff to avoid these annoying things? so, i go the app for the ipad. which was not very clear. in the app store, it is not clear *which* app is the one to get! the actual app has such an ambiguous icon design too. well, after not being sure, i just downloaded it and it was the right app.but i soon found out that, my ipad was, apparently, too old and not all things in the app worked on it! there was no phone calling icon at the bottom (looks like a voice bubble). so i had to get the app on my iphone (which is where i did not want it as i am out of memory as it is only a 16gb iphone). the phone option does work on that newer device. i see no reason for the ipad to not also have this feature. none of the phone calling actually happens from the ios device. it is basically an amazon voip service. it is just for set up and, when i now click on that icon at the bottom, it basically just says, it is set up!there is also some confusing as to which number to use. i have a land line and a mobile. i used the mobile number but, i think this may be a problem as i also ordered the incoming phone call echo connect, due out later in december 2018. it will allow me to have 911 service (i think, hope) from the echo.911well, contrary to what you heard or read, alexis and echo devices cannot make 911 calls! this is due to the fcc requiring that it be a phone land line or, a cell phone, so the 911 call center can locate the caller. since the voip service from the echo is outgoing only (basically, like skype), it cannot alert a 911 operator as to your location. i think, hope, that the connect will fill in this gap.having a smart home device that can call 911 will be a game changer for the elderly! my mom had severe ra and fell in her 80s, and could not get up. she lay for many hours until the neighbor is son came by with her mail that late afternoon (she paid him to get it from the street side mail box as she could not walk that far in winter on snow and ice.) he then got his dad who called 911. it turns out, laying that long for the elderly causes micro strokes. it also causes the elderly to basically get groggy and not think clearly. she was in the hospital for 4 or 5 days. it cost medicare thousands of dollars. she did recover but, if she had a smart speaker and it could call 911, the local fire department would have had her lifted up in under 30 minutes to her chair. the end.amazon: you need to work on this. a huge market is there and growing with baby boomers aging and in denial about the costs and issues with growing old.stuffthe echo does a lot of other stuff. i linked it to a sensi thermostat. it would not link to my swithchmate device i use to turn on the front porch lights. it is mostly on a timer but, it would be cool to be able to tell the lights to come on early for say, an amazon delivery of an echo! the echo cannot link to homekit devices. again, hopefully, apple and amazon can make this happen. homekit is now software based and has become an open api. so, amazon could link homekit devices to alexis easy!i found the ability to make a custom routine frustrating. i set up a morning ""start my day"" with weather and some national news. but, i want to be able to access some specific business news later during the day. but the routine option only allows me to have my morning flash stuff play when i set up a second new routine?! this makes no sense. in the am, i want weather and broad world and national news news. during the day, i only want a ""business news"" flash when i call for it. no weather or national news. it is so odd that it forces you to only use the one and only flash briefing? either this is a major ux screw up or, a massive bug.skills storethe ""apps"" for the alexis are called skills. i found the skills store to be almost totally useless. it has a lot. it is like an early roku channel store just filling up with tons of useless crap like, a fart skill (alexis, fart for me) and duplication of skills (how many flashing nightlight do we need?) amazon needs to get this under control now before it is overwhelmed.finding a skill is not easy. you have to know its name and enter it to search. the browsing feature is useless because, too many skills are there now. amazon, do not feel bad. apple and others stink at this too. here is your chance to impress and overtake the others by making your skills store better, easier, more useful, and weeded out or segregating the junk.the skills store also lacks some categories which could be good. lifestyles is just too broad. i would like to see a seperate arts category, there is a sports so why not! local performance venues of all kinds can be skills as well as national events and exhibitions at college museums, etc. the arts is a bigger money maker then sports but, gets ignored.also audio books and interactive could be their own categories."
22093,12,"love it great device,  many uses."
22094,11,very poor sound extremely disappointed sounds like a tiny little radio
22095,2,i love it!!
22096,14,"overall good. two easy things it might want to improve though: 1) too much bass, the hardware should find its balance 2) enable users to change other wake up names, like sebastian. add a choice for male voice."
22097,0,"it would be much better if this device was wireless. i get frustrated because often times when i request a specific song, i am told that i must purchase a subscription to hear the entire song."
22098,1,exceptional!!!!
22099,4,it is too complicated to set up
22100,8,great product
22101,10,i love the echo second generation- it is fun and always gives me history when i say good morning and when i say goodnight i get a pleasant response. it was a small challenge to set it up but worth it.
22102,14,music did not work unless you paid for amazon music even when i linked my pandora it did not work. and half the time alexa stopped working and i had to unplug her and plug her back in. i returned it.
22103,0,"alexa never answers me , she lights up but does not say anything,  mayby once in awhile she will give a weather report , way not worth the money,  rip off"
22104,14,the only reason for 4 stars is i¡¯m still figuring out all alexa (echo) can do. so far this has been a fun device. speaker quality is great!
22105,14,worked great at first...now it will not do anything. i sent for a return but have not heard back. would like to exchange it please. it was a gift for my parents and it has not worked for over a week.
22106,14,having a bright pulsing light in your bedroom at night is the worst possible option. with no way to turn off the light ring i am unable to turn off my buyer is remorse.
22107,14,inadequate data base
22108,14,"good sound but.... the only internet i have is my phones hotspot., and the app loses connection to hotspot then has a heck of a time reconnecting.... requires complete setup everytime."
22109,12,it is fun to see how smart alexa is.
22110,14,the sound quality is awful. i would recommend buying something else.
22111,8,love it!
22112,14,"the echo was purchased by an american and even after changing the settings to degrees celsius, it still gives the temperature for the state it was shipped to, nor does it understand provinces."
22113,14,"okay so i had two of the echoes sent to me. the sound quality was absolutely horrible when you turned the volume up. it had a terrible reverberation, sounded like a blown speaker. i sent that one back and got a brand new one a couple days later and had the same exact problem. amazon has been very good about taking the products back but i am very disappointed because i really wanted to own this."
22114,14,"my echo did not even sync, i tried several times and does not do anything for me , i will return it and was going to buy for gifts for family as gifts , changed my mind ,it is useless for me ."
22115,14,"i own two original echos and wanted to buy a third. decided to wait for the 2nd generation with ¡°better sound¡±. did a side by side comaprison and there is no doubt about it, the original sounds a lot better. it appears that most or all of the reviews from those doing a side by side comparison are saying the same thing. i always felt i could trust amazon even though i know they are a company looking for profits. my guard is now up."
22116,11,"the sound is definitely better, but i  do not like the volume buttons. the ring rotation was infinitely easier, especially in low light."
22117,14,"**edit**i am adding this edit to my review because after i could not handle the crackling anymore i called amazon support, and the support tech said he would run a remote diagnostics on my device. after running the diagnostics he said that it came back with some hardware errors, and so my echo was under warranty, and a replacement was sent to me. i will get it tomorrow so i will update my review as needed. the exact error was something to do with the speaker connection, and he said even if i kept it that eventually the speaker would totally fail.**original review** 3 starsokay so the crackling seems to be subjective to what its playing. sometimes it does it sometimes it does not. trying to pin it down, but when it does play clear it sounds very nice."
22118,14,"i do not get the negative reviews about the ""bad"" sound quality. i had initially read that you should hook this up to an external speaker via bluetooth. i had it hooked up to my bose soundlink, but ended up disconnecting it. while the bose can go louder, for our 1250 sq ft house, it works perfectly. i no longer have it hooked up to my bose speaker.this is my first echo and i love it. it sounds great, is immediately responsive and incredibly easy to set up. all i did was plug it in and open the app on my phone. took about 2 minutes total to set up and link it with my bose speaker. i currently have only a couple of smart home devices in my home now, but am definitely looking at getting more to hook up to the echo.this makes my morning routine with my son a lot easier as he likes listening to amazon storytime while i get everything ready. i also like being able to say ""alexa, good morning"" and having her tell me what the weather will be like today and giving me the top news of the morning. my wife was not initially sold on getting one of these, but so far she loves the shopping list, timer/alarm, and game features we have used. i look forward to learning more about what i can do with it, but for now i do not have anything negative to report! i will update if anything changes"
22119,14,crap had to send it back did not work
22120,8,love it
22121,0,"decent sound. it does not answer 99% of questions, easy ones. non-learning, other than what amazon forces. expensive voice to text command toy."
22122,10,i think it is great. we have a lot of fun talking to it!
22123,12,just fantastic.
22124,14,what a pain.  this is way too much effort  to set up as a bluetooth speaker.  the alexa feature is pointless.
22125,9,i love these echo units.  sound quality is nice.  bought several more as christmas gifts.
22126,8,love it!!
22127,4,meets all ectation - very convenient source of ingormation.
22128,11,"very muffled sound, even for alexa is voice.  very disappointed."
22129,1,not happy with this product.
22130,11,sound quality was bad
22131,14,"update: with the firmware update, the sound has improved slightly. less ¡°tinny¡± and a little more bass. hopefully future updates will improve it even more.original review:i was excited to get the new echo but was soon disappointed.the description said, ¡°...has a 2.5¡± downward-firing woofer and 0.6¡± tweeter to deliver crisp vocals and dynamic bass throughout the room....¡±the music quality is very ¡°tinny¡± with limited base, nowwhere near dynamic base that would spread throughout the room.my first generation echo sounds much better and this is barely better than the sound of my echo dot. i had high expectations and ended up with a ¡°dot and a half¡±i do like the look and size, but the sound leaves a lot to be desired."
22132,14,i currently have many different echos and this by far is the worst. i am not sure if i got a lemon and need to return but his echo never complete request. need help
22133,1,high sound quality
22134,1,great
22135,1,alexa is great
22136,5,gift
22137,0,it knows nothing!  all the things you thought you could do with it require addl apps and plug ins. the most simplest questions are never answered.  so disappointing......
22138,14,"i hoped the echo would sync with my smart tv for sound, and thought the 3 units could be used at the same time. unable to do either. i want to return the units."
22139,14,you have no idea how many uses you can have for alexa. the possibilities are endless.
22140,14,"just ordered 3 more for the house, replacing the echo dots currently active.  sound is more than acceptable, in fact seems to have gotten better since it first arrived... thanks for the software updates!  best feature of these is the multi-room music capability.  now i enjoy great music throughout my house, without a single node blaring to fill the space.  another feature i use is to adjust the volume of all the echos in the group."
22141,14,spent hours does it work w android?  got it connected to wifi no problem...now what?
22142,12,the echo has been great!
22143,14,this echo is great with sound i love how it can fill the room with music and i am partially deaf so this is abgreat help and benefit to me.
22144,14,is it suppose to stop playing music over a period of time?
22145,3,as advertised works great.
22146,9,not happy with my purchase
22147,14,"my biggest complaint is the lack of adaptability this device has to various real world situations. for example, in my case, i needed to setup this echo without a regular wi-fi network and it took me nearly 2 hours to get through that quagmire. i just wanted to use it as a bluetooth speaker at a worksite, but it refused to do anything until i setup a wi-fi network on it. amazon really needs to make this thing more flexible so it is not such a burden to the end user."
22148,14,the echo stopped working after few days. i do not know the reason yet. it may be the power adapter but not sure. i do not know if it can be replaced
22149,0,waste of time and money .
22150,0,"no instructions to set up. and if you ask alexa a common knowledge question, 50% chance she will not know it, or she will give an unrelated, nonsensical answer."
22151,4,arrived quick. easy to set up.
22152,14,"love it! i¡¯m not sure what others are complaining about with the speakers, but mine works great (echo 2nd generation)! there is echo and echo plus; so please make sure you¡¯re talking about the right one! so far, i have no issues; although, i do wish it was compatible with youtube, maybe on the next update?? lol"
22153,14,lack integration with spotify on multiroom - can not connect multiple times - amazon music only accessible through alexa app which is very annoying
22154,14,"i love my first generate echo and both my echo dots... so i decided to try this one when it was on sale.  first of all, the ""sale"" price is actually more than i paid originally since it does not include a remote.  i set up the echo, and paired my old remote to it after unpairing it from my other echo (which is now in a small room). it consistently screws up.  it only responds to the remote every two or three times i use it (and yes, i hold down the button).  customer support actually suggested i put in the batteries with the positive sides touching each other!  sometimes, i can not get it to stop even when i got over and press the button and talk to it directly.  i really am not happy."
22155,0,i do not have a smart home so it is basically a toy.  sound quality is good.
22156,11,"this is my first echo so i have nothing to compare this unit to. that being said, it does what it is supposed to do so i¡¯m happy with it! very nice and sleek, goes great with my decor."
22157,14,"alexa can ruin christmas.  why?  when you have alexa in your house and you order xmas gifts, the apps and alexa are hell bent on telling your entire family that you have notifications.  when the kids read them to make the stupid lights stop blinking, it tells them what was ordered.  so not only do they now know what they are getting, they know santa is not real.  thanks a hell of a lot, amazon."
22158,14,"i really wanted to love the echo, but honestly, between the two i prefer the google home system. to me, the speaker sounds better and i just find that google is better at web options. if you are the kind of person who wants to ask your home assistant random web questions, the google system is much better than echo. i am not the kind of user who tells my echo to order a lot for me - i prefer to do that myself so i can chose options off amazon. this function is really only useful if you are reordering something off of amazon that you have already purchased. i find the google app easier to navigate, and i am not an android user at all. these systems are great for helping you realize how much you murmur or do not enunciate, but google home can understand me far more often than the echo has (english is my first language, and my accent is decidedly californian). if i needed another speaker i will probably get another google home."
22159,0,"she does not no anything, and im hooked to wifi, but she still does not no much, would like to trade it back in for the google home !!!!!!!!"
22160,14,"i could not get music.  that was the primary reason i wanted the device.  the message given, was something about i was'nt connected for that.  help."
22161,0,i do not like the fact that it only works with a power cord. what i do like is umm well i can not think of anything that i like about it!
22162,14,i was so excited about getting this. in the commercials (as all commercials) it shows this can do so much more. it took forever to get it to play my own music. i had to download amazon music and download my music in order for alexa to play them. then it will only allow so many songs. it will not sinc with my stereo. the commercials make it seem i can program it to recognize all my families voices. yeah; that only works if we each have our own amazon account. i am not registering my two children on amazon just so this can recognize their voices. i have also noticed she perks up when she hears her name even on these commercials. she is even answered once; that was hilarious.
22163,0,very easy set up. nice sound qualities. happy with my purchase. the only reason i did not give it 5 stars is because i did not know you need th tp-links
22164,0,she hates me. i swear. i ask her for something and she ignores me or hears something else. my husband asks and she answers. biotch.
22165,9,great investment and gift idea!
22166,7,not really what i expected does not  recognize my voice. i¡¯m not satisfied <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0092>
22167,14,"all-new echo (2nd generation) with improved sound, powered by dolby, and a new design - charcoal fabrici guess this is mostly a review for alexa.  the speaker itself is great and the hardware and packaging create a compact speaker that fits well into every corner of the house.  unfortunately,  the hardware is dependent on the alexa ecosystem which is simply incomplete for any but the most basic tasks.  i mainly try to use the system for music and it is a struggle daily.  the alexa app is equally useless, burdened with too many selections in nonintuitive locations.  music constantly drops out, channels are difficult to navigate, changing stations or songs is hit and miss.  i am hoping google and apple have done better product testing before launching.  amazon has the benefit of first to market but if performance does not improve drastically then they will soon be overtaken by the other big players."
22168,11,good product - wish i could adjust bass & treble in the app. sound is not great - just ok - but i love using alexa to control my home.
22169,14,disappointed and unimpressed.  inconsistent in responding and my clock radio sounds better.
22170,0,i love it but unfortunately have not been able to use it very often as it keeps going of the wifi and takes me forever to reconnect.
22171,10,"positively awesome, easy setup wow so easy, exceeds all expectations! just love it. grand kids have a blast. two day delivery can not be beet. wow!s"
22172,0,horrible cant get it to work. paid a lot if money at christmas and it still diesnt work. i want to return it but dont know how
22173,0,its nice it just needs major updates more music\songs alot of times alexa cant find songs i want
22174,14,"the echo by itself is not that impressive, but adding products to your home that can be controlled by alexa is what makes this product great!"
22175,14,"is a total headache trying to connect to wifi, if asqued i will not recommend purchasing this device, not user friendly, not ease to setup,"
22176,8,love it@
22177,0,alexa do not know  about some artist for example r&b songs and some time it is hard for her to follow commands
22178,0,awesome device. too bad you have to pay for so many extras and services to get full use out of it.
22179,0,i only use it to listen to music and i do not like the music you choose.  if i request a specific selection it is unavailabe.
22180,14,"will still continue to use it as a speaker, but incredibly disappointed with its 'skills' and overall ability to execute commands. i often will tell it to play rain sounds and according to the app it will hear ""play rain sounds"" but what it will actually do is anybody is guess. normally it will hear ""play rain sounds"" but will play an audio book or it will play music. when this happens i will try another command and it will (again according to the app) hear what i told it to do, but do something else. the only way i have found to fix this is to either unplug and replug the echo or disable and re-enable all the skills. it feels like i am stuck in the early 2000s when the solution for everything was to plug and replug something. overall incredibly disappointed with a device that so many speak so highly of. so long as it can still understand 'pair with my iphone' i will continue to use it as a very expensive bluetooth speaker but that is all it is good for in my opinion."
22181,14,"so bitter... i bought an echo and the day after i get it, it goes 15$ of on sale... good product but this salts me :("
22182,10,"the sound is fantastic and so easy to use, have not found anything that we dislike with the two echoes we purchased."
22183,0,"it is not portable, need to plug to power all the time, sound quality is not that great!! cannot connect to multiple bluetooths."
22184,14,some things were kind of cool but simple fact is i have moved it from a couple place i have and when you try and change the address every time you click the address line and you start typing it goes back to the settings before you can change it and i have literally spent three or four hours trying on five or six different occasions to be fast enough in the four five seconds once you touch the address and try and change it before it erases all your changes and go straight back to what it was you can not do the basics ship that keeps you alive with 911 emergency there is absolutely no reason to buy one of these things no matter how borderline almost kind of barely worth considering only one is
22185,0,its alright i guess.
22186,0,like to be able to touch and ask questions for her to answer without her not sure and give no reason.
22187,14,it is not as smart as google. i asked it how a crystal radio works and it could not answer.i bought it in the states and brought it back to canada. setting it up was an unnessary hassle because the apps are not available in canada!!!has amazon never heard of cross border shopping!!the sound coming out from the speaker is better than expected . if you ask it to play a song from a foreign artist you have better luck if you pronounce it american than in the native dialect .setting up and recognition of home devices is very good.looking forward to an update that would include the existence of canada.
22188,14,"i moved to asia and sadly , my echo is not fully functioned and it turned out to be a speaker rather than my home assistant"
22189,9,"i gave it as a retirement gift,but from their thank you they are enjoying it a lot."
22190,14,can be hacked putting id information at risk.  can not find music unless purchased from amazon or pay - to listen channels.
22191,0,i love the sound. i can get very loud. but i wish it was battery operated so i can move it around the house
22192,14,it was a gift for my elderly father.  i wish we could change the voice to a man is as my dad can not hear the female voice.
22193,1,very pleased.
22194,0,good except sometimes i have to yell at it for it to hear me. also the pandora connection does not always work.
22195,9,the echo started and stopped frequentlynot happy with it after high expectationsreturned it
22196,0,used to work.  now it stopped and we cannot figure out how to reconnect it.
22197,14,"way overpriced for what this actually is. definitely go for the echo show, this is not worth the money."
22198,14,still learning how to use it.  not compatible with mac bood pro.
22199,0,not that useful
22200,14,i love the echo products. the all-new echo with improved sound does not deliver what it promises....  sound is not very good.  buyer beware on this.update:well.  got a call from amazon and they were very professional and transparent.  i am still not a fan of this particular echo as it is shipped today but i do believe they continue to update the firmware and with their attitude and diligence i am sure they will nail it.  probably re-buy one in 6 or so months to see how it is improved. the first update was pretty dramatic in a positive way.  moving my rating from a 1 to a 3.
22201,14,returned
22202,14,very bad product.  setup is lousy and will not connect to internet.  support from amazon is terrible.
22203,14,the sound is good but i do not like that it is not cordless. i apparently did not read the fine print that stated that.
22204,11,love the echo 1st edition - got this one expecting something new - really just the same - and sound quality is about the same - bit dissapointed - but if you do not have an echo you will not be dissapointed - great product. update - also just did a side by side on the sound - 1st gen is better - omg are they kidding ¡°improved¡±.
22205,14,it does not work in brasil yet
22206,9,great sound quality and a nice gift to give someone who has just moved into a new home! i love all my devices!
22207,14,my wife decided she did not want.  attempted to return on feb 14.  as of feb 22 still has not been picked up.
22208,0,enjoy asking alexa questions.one ce she started playing music on her own.
22209,14,sound sounds good.but i cant give it a 5 star.1.minamal set up instructions.could of added better explanation instead of plug in and follow instructions2.we eneded up messing thing up because it dont explain that it has to be tied to one account only witch is rediculous.i dont like the fact that only one account controlls everything.that one account has to add you and you can only have 2 adults on the account.3.cant add my kids so they can use there profile when they come over{see #2}because there not teens.4. i would like to listen to a certin song without creating an exstencive play list on a music app. i dont want to get.if you ask me all this is is an expencive speaker.but its still cool.
22210,14,"i absolutely hate it.  the sound quality is beyond horrible, it was a complete nightmare to set up, and after 1 day, the light ring will not light up and it will not respond to alexa.  i cannot believe what a piece of junk this thing is.  during the brief time that it did work properly, i was not at all impressed by the functionality or features.  returning it immediately.  really, really bummed because i have heard so many good things about it and was really looking forward to using it.also, yes, i did notice that there was a firmware update that was supposed to fix the sound issues but, even though mine is apparently up to date, it still sounds like garbage."
22211,14,"the sound is great, but if you want music, they keep on selling their product."
22212,1,very happy!
22213,0,"difficult to get on line,  not yet!"
22214,14,"i originally posted that the sound was disappointing, this is coming from someone who previously owned a google home. after re-listening to alexa, i realized she sounds much better the louder she is played. i hope that they improve the sound, however, it is otherwise much more superior than the google home. alexa can easily hear me even when she is at her max volume playing music. the functionality and commands are awesome, so is the app. i loved the fact that amazon personally called me to see how i felt about the device. amazing customer service. i will be sticking with alexa now and in the future. she is worth it if you do not have one already."
22215,14,seems loss wi-fi connection a lot. overall just ok.
22216,14,"i have six echos in my house. yes, you read that correctly - six. i have a couple original echos, a few dots, a show, and now the 2nd gen echo. all of my old echo devices support spotify, but this new 2nd gen is not recognized."
22217,7,love it<f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+008e>
22218,14,the only reason i did not give it a 5 star was because i wish it had a built in battery.
22219,2,i love love love alexa the most.
22220,11,lower power than the original echo. poorer sound quality. not sure what is the point of this new echo.
22221,14,"the 1st gen echo has pretty good sound quality for what it is and for amazon to tout that this 2nd generation has better audio made me excited to buy. after setup, it was clear that the audio is pretty bad. i have heard better from significantly cheaper bluetooth speakers. sound is muddy and flat, very little bass. thank goodness it is easy to return items to amazon. based on amazon is marketing claims, i feel like amazon is really breaking the trust here.the alexa features are good, and work as expected, except mine had a very hard time pairing with my phone or bluetooth speaker. the new look is nice!i have returned this unit, and from what i have read and seen online, the new echo plus does not sound great either. disappointing since our family uses our echo a lot for decent background music while cooking or having parties."
22222,14,does not retain skill levels well. after enabling skill level does not recall enabled radio stations.
22223,14,"we asked for a two but we do not think we got one, there was no indication on the box or unit itself."
22224,14,the thing is worthless if it refuses to connect to anything!! waste of money for my gift giver
22225,14,horrible. never hears me when i say ''alexa.....''
22226,14,bought the wrong one. wanted the portable. did not realize i had to sign up for amazon music
22227,14,wish i could give it half a star the longer you have it the less it works got it around the first week of  dec 20017 worked great at first now by dec 30th 2017 it hardly works no matter if you reboot everything she just stops working right. sorry i spent my money on it never have gotten anything from amazon that i was very disappointed in before would not tell my friends to buy it. it is junk.
22228,14,google is better and more accurate.
22229,11,"<u+00a0>it fits my bedroom well. i have a 1st gen echo in my living room, and it is a bit too large for my bedroom desk, so i used to put an echo dot in my bedroom but i want better audio. this guy solves the problem!"
22230,14,bought it for my son and he passed away before christmas still sitting in box unopened :(
22231,14,was not as described in description
22232,0,"great music source. even though it id  a small amount, i do not like paying for the music"
22233,14,too much bass....no adjustment.i hear the new apple home pod is amazing !
22234,0,will not play most of the songs i requested. they are all songs easily got on you tube.
22235,14,every time i turned it all the way up it turned off. also it do not get loud as a pill
22236,14,it is the worst thing i bought from amazon.simple is to complicate to make it to work.
22237,14,"does not acknowledge voice requests,  only works thru the smart phone app."
22238,1,gift
22239,3,lest thing  sound not as good as i thought
22240,14,i cant connect alexa whis my mini smart socket is there anybody can help/?
22241,12,works very well. would really like napster support though
22242,14,"for some reason the response time on my new echo is much slower, than on my previous one, but the price, size and most importantly the sound quality are a huge improvement.alexa still struggles to play my own playlists and get the right music from my music library, and playing a whole album instead of just the song if the album and a song on it with the same title as the album, but it is getting better.it is certainly worth having especially if you are a prime member. and even better if you have amazon music."
22243,0,could never get it to connect. very disappointed! waste  of money!
22244,0,i like the music the most. i do not like the lack of directions  on how to use it.
22245,1,it is great when it works.
22246,14,had it for 1 day now it does not work. sending it back
22247,14,it works fine when it stays connected to the internet. thinking about selling it
22248,1,great sound.
22249,10,"great product, love it. now to slowly expand to more products by amazon alexa."
22250,11,"sound is too muffled, too much bass and hard to hear the midrange /voice range."
22251,8,love it!
22252,0,its alright but somtime not too communicative
22253,0,have not tried all features. wish it had the 9hr battery so i can use outside.
22254,14,having a lot of fun with it with my grandkids who are 15 mos and 3.5 yrs.
22255,3,had no expectations---was a gift---just another gizmo cluttering  life.
22256,12,cool stuff but pity can not use it in taiwan.
22257,14,difficult to sync. gave up on it. would u like it back.
22258,11,simple to set up. the sound quality is not to bad  overall it works well.
22259,8,love this!
22260,14,"after reading many reviews about poor sound quality, i tried to ask a product question about the situation. apparently i will need to update the firmware and wanted some guidance with this. when i tried to get an answer via email or chat, i was forced into a phone call with a customer service call with an agent from india who had zero clues. they then put me on hold for 5 minutes, then hung up on me. after a great experience setting up the echo dot last month, i had higher expectations for how this would go. this was the worst! i guess i will return this and buy the sonos product instead in hopes that they are better at making -- and supporting-- hardware than amazon."
22261,14,"it is an excellent device. works perfectly and smarter than me for sure! we love all the skills we can add, and the music sounds beautiful! but, i¡¯ve given a lower rating because the selling of the echo on amazon is very misleading. no where in the product description does it say that it requires a dc cord for power. the pictures are also what is misleading. none of the pictures show a cord attached making you believe it is wireless. we have a family member who is quite ill and is a fall risk. we are not able to have any extra cords lying around that could trip her, and we¡¯d like to easily move the echo from room to room for her without a cord. i understand there are devices that are wireless, but i thought that i was buying one because of the misleading description and pictures."
22262,9,just received this about an hour ago and i am in love.
22263,9,i am afraid i might become like juaquin phoenix because i love alexa.
22264,14,songs are skipping and we are getting very irritated!
22265,11,great product but too much up selling.
22266,14,just doest work will with my internet service
22267,14,will not play music continually even when purchased upgrade.
22268,0,waste of money does not do what its supposed just a novelty
22269,9,"i love my alexa, there will be plenty more echo purchases"
22270,14,"i bought it to use in canada, but it does not work there."
22271,0,"alexa says,""sorry, i can not talk now. try again later.."
22272,1,amazing product terrible shipping and handling
22273,1,great device. great addition to our home.
22274,14,cant get it to connect to wireless network. what a joke.
22275,14,"i have a partial hearing loss which caused sound from the original echo to sound like random low-frequency scratching when i lay on my side in bed listening to music.this version solves that problem. music now sounds like music. <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+0083>the only thingi do not like is that i can not change the volume using the top ring anymore, but have to use inconveniently placed buttons on the top of the echo to do that.other than that, i am completely satisfied."
22276,1,great product
22277,0,trouble finding apps through the echp app.
22278,14,the echo outer case was ripped everything else is ok
22279,14,"i bought this to improve on the sound quality over the echo dot.  i thought it would be a slam dunk since the dot is so small.  but the sound output of this echo is way off.  lots of boomy bass, and little treble.  not good for music at all.  who signed off on this?i like the alexa platform, but i am thinking i will need to outsource the audio to a decent bluetooth speaker like the ue boom.  the ue boom is far superior to the echo in the sound quality department."
22280,0,disappointed it did not have music.
22281,1,very happy with it
22282,9,i love it sounds great in the bedroom
22283,14,love!
22284,14,"i really do not use this.  the internet at home is too slow to use, rendering it totally useless.  so it sits in my office and plays rain forrest sounds when it wants (sometimes some song comes on that i am unfamiliar with.....) my daughter plays songs on it when she is waiting for me to get off work, and i have cranked the volume on it when nobody is around.  it works exceptionally well as a speaker; super loud and clear sounding.  for me, though, not worth the money."
22285,11,the microphone is not so good.
22286,8,just great love it
22287,12,not happy with it we can not get it to talk
22288,0,i like it. got to pronounce to words right!

22290,1,just perfect
22291,14,does not work in mexico
22292,14,it is useless compared to google home
22293,12,its goood
22294,0,it does not work right
22295,1,very good product. would recommend.
22296,1,great product. phenomenal sound
22297,10,i use it for the music and radio.
22298,8,love it.
22299,10,easy to use but...just a radio
22300,8,i love mine!!!
22301,8,loving this device!!
22302,1,really nice+!!
22303,3,how did i live without before?
22304,1,best speaker ever.
22305,10,dont like it
22306,14,"i was hoping that the all-new echo will be my primary speaker for my apartment. i was excited because the ads says ""improved sound, powered by dolby,"" but boy i was wrong. alexa has slower response and sounds quality is not better than the first. ended up returning it."
22307,3,sounds great
22308,0,i do not like her at all

22315,14,"it worked yesterday and now it will not connect to wifi. the app for this device is absolute garbage - cannot do anything and either crashes or gives error codes with no link to correct issues. the best part is there is no one to call. coming soon - my refurbished echo, because this expensive paperweight is getting sent back!"
22316,14,can not link it up to wi fi
22317,8,love it
22318,4,difficult to install.
22319,12,limited features.
22320,4,too hard to use
22321,8,love it
22322,14,works great. i can position the 3 around the house. have only used it today tho. thought i would be able to play on multiple devices with amazon music subscription but no... it will only let one device play at a time.

22337,14,"software update definitely helped. audio quality is slightly better than my original echo now. laggy responses also stopped. glad amazon worked so quickly to did l fix things (though it should have shipped without this problem). original two star review below.--after sitting for a while, the new echo takes longer to respond than my old echo. after the first response, it then speeds up with additional requests. it misunderstood me in a quiet room, and the sound does not sound any better either. i am really sad."
22338,8,love it!
22339,14,cord broke
22340,0,"so far i relly like it.  not sure how the ap works, however.  i do not want to pay a monthly fee, so..we will see how it goes.when playing music, however, it does stop and i have to tell it to keep playing.  not sure about that either.;"
22341,11,like everything about the echo except for the fact that it is not wireless. would be much nicer wireless.
22342,9,love her
22343,12,love it.
22344,8,love it!
22345,8,awesome
22346,14,"family brought this to me for christmas and was very excited about the device. after speaking with their technical department i found out that foreign cell carriers will not receive the sms message containing the verification code to complete the set up for voice and messaging. this is a bit odd since during the set up you can choose from a list containing every single country code, in my case it was japan. if that is not an option i am wondering why it is even available to input foreign cell numbers during the set up.  at this point the device is really nothing more than siri running on a bluetooth speaker."
22347,9,"bought a three pack and hue bulbs with a gift card a received. very impressed so far, very good sound quality. i never owned a first gen, but this sounds really good to me. looking to get a bloom spotlight and other bulbs for my apartment."
22348,14,echo will not setup or detect the network.  i have 2 others (old generation) that set up fine. this machine is a buggy piece of trash and cannot recommend it.
22349,14,"only use this a few days, but i can tell a difference from the echo dot, better sound and they pick up your conversation while music is blaring away. would recommend to anybody that wants the latest and greatest."
22350,14,"i should have listened to the bad reviews. sound is not good. i might be spoiled with my dr. dre beats pill though.... but alexa makes me feel lazy, it is just google. but what is frustrating is her favorite response to most of my questions is ""i am sorry, i do not know that one"". i am over the concept. i will stick to the ""old fashion"" google on my phone."
22351,14,"piece of yuppie spy-weardrivers for 'unknown peripheral device' cannot be downloadedyou need to be a nuclear physicist to get the bluetooth compatible with any laptopwasted an entire day-off from work trying all the 'fixes'the 'support' tollfree number is uselessbesides, it is a crap yuppie one-size-fit-all mono speakersave up your money for a real bluetooth speakerthe gimmicks and alexis genie are just there to suck your credit card drybig waste of time for stupid gadget"
22352,14,"i got an echo one i set it up to turn lights on and off and to turn the socket on and off.  set up for these things is not obviousthey could use a much better application anyways i purchased  an echo 2, the shape is different but otherwise i can not see a great deal of value added.  the good bitch is that everything configured on the echo one also worked on the echo 2"
22353,11,"i purchased this with the thought that it would replace my 1st gen echo and that gen1 would than be moved to my bedroom.  after comparing the sounds between gen 1 and gen 2, it was obvious to me that gen 1 was superior.  so, gen 1 stays in the living room and gen 2 has replaced the dot in the bedroom.  gen 2 looks nice with the heather gray fabric and it is a little shorter but the sound quality is just average, although much better than the dot.  i¡¯m an amazon fan but i might just have to try out a google and see how that compares to echo."
22354,10,i am new to echo and i am loving it!  i wanted it mainly for music and subscribed to amazon unlimited music.  awesome!  the sound is  really quite good. i can not wait to try new things with it.
22355,14,"bought five (5) of these after hearing about the new multi-room audio feature.  i have been trying to find a decent way of playing music in every room without having to spend thousands and deal with running tons of wires to in-ceiling speakers, so the idea of being able to group two or more echo devices into a single music source sounded like an amazing solution.unfortunately, i just learned that amazon is multi-room audio feature does not work with spotify.  this is really sad because you can use a single echo device with spotify, and you can play multi-room audio with multiple echo devices....you just can not do multi-room using spotify (apparently you can do this with amazon is own music service, but that service sucks).  another frustrating point -- you can do multi-room audio with spotify using google is competing devices, so this does not really appear to be an issue with spotify....it is an issue with amazon.bottom line -- do not buy these if you are planning to use them for multi-room audio with spotify.  i was hopeful that feature would be added soon, but if you do a little research, you will see that both spotify and echo users have been asking about this for months, and apparently no solution has been offered."
22356,14,"upon opening this item i found that the instructions were completely inadequate. the device was unable to connect to the internet, and the instructions explained that i should be able to find the new wifi connection, (even gave its name), in the wifi properties of my iphone. no such wifi connection was available to be located, so, i returned the whole ball of wax. i would not have given it a single star, but then i would not have been allowed the opportunity."
22357,14,"i own at least one of every echo. early buyer of the original, the tap, echo dot original and dot 2.add the echo hub to the mix.the sound is terrible and it wont connect to the hub. i bought 3 for gifts and plan to return all of them. amazon, if there is an update i missed let me know."
22358,14,"3/4 is of the time it just starts looping and trying to find the song or artist i asked for and does not find it........i have to tell it to shut offthe correct ""hit rate"" is about 35% the wrong ""hit rate"" is about 5% and the no ""hit rate"" is about 50-60%"
22359,14,"bought 7 echo (2nd generation) devices and have spent over 4 hours trying to connect to the wifi. no success, even after hours on the phone with amazon support and numerous re-configurations of my router causing all my other wifi devices to have to be modified as well. in the connected world we live, it has to be easier to set these up.  fyi i have an echo (1st generation) which works perfectly and has never had an issue."
22360,14,"i¡¯ve always wanted to have 2-3 sonos speakers around my house for a constant, low, surround sound of music while i work, cook, etc, but i can not justify dishing out $1000+ for a few speakers. enter the new echo.i¡¯ve used an echo dot in my kitchen for a while now, but it really was not cutting it so i decided to take the current deal and get 3 echos for $250.  after strategically placing them throughout the lower level i am fairly impressed. i¡¯m no audiophile, so the sound is decent and covers the ~1200 sq ft pretty well.the disappointment comes after setup. i¡¯ve always been extremely impressed with the spotify-echo connection, but spotify will only play on one echo at a time. no grouping whatsoever. for someone that just spent $250 and now has 4 echos in my house i¡¯m slightly upset that i can not play spotify across the home..."
22361,14,1. the sound quality is terrible.2.  i set a reminder.  i told it to stop.  it said it had stopped.  it had not.  it went on until i unplugged it.
22362,0,censors the hell out of song titles as light as wang dang sweet poontang by ted nugent.great for not having to look up the weather.
22363,14,"i own the original echo, two 2nd gen echo dots and an echo tap . they are used to control my smart home and  the original echo provided background music in an east in kitchen.first the appearance is stellar compared to the original echo (see photo). second, the sound quality is significantly better and my spouse who is not very finicky about sound even admitted the improvement.  this was to be expected with the improved speaker (woofer-tweeter combo).  in addition there is an mini audio out port which is a nice addition.the real surprise came in the huge improvement in the 2nd generation echo is ability to hear you.  it is placed about 10 feet further away than the original yet hears us better!!!  i initially had both echos active and asked to turn on a light.  the 2nd gen, 10 feet further away hard me and turned on the light and i was facing away from it when i spoke. awesome.if you talk to your echo often, and why else would you have one, you will be very happy with this upgrade.  looks great, sounds great and hears great.wish list: the ability to connect two echos for a stereo field.***** edit***** after seeing all of the negative reviews and knowing my own experience i suspect that amazon shipped a bunch of defective units because mine sounds stuningly better than my original echo and just works better all around.  for all of the negative reviews, they should be returning those units to amazon."
22364,14,"i am a pretty basic user: music, alarms, utlitarian stuff that us older folks buy echos for. so i can not tell you all the fun and fancy skills you can play with, though when younger folks come over i take them through a few. i can tell you that the new echo is an amazing bargain, ridiculously easy to set up and contrary to what you may read in reviews et al, the sound is amazing. crisper, clearer and more powerful. and if you do not like the sound, or want more bass or to make the woofer louder, just say, ""alexa, turn up/increase the (whatever you want)."" and you will be thrilled with the results. there are nay sayers out there who insist this only increases the volume in general, but that is not true. most of all, though, just enjoy your echo, however you use it. i have two and a dot and i am loving them all!"
22365,14,"does not sound nearly as good as the original echo, even though it is touted as a replacement. i was going to sell off my original to justify this one. but instead i¡¯ll be probably sending this back and keeping my original. this is crap. seriously amazon, what did you do to my beloved device?!"
22366,14,this is just a devise to make your mobile phone more hands free if you plan on using as a speaker only for music or movie purposes i would not recommend the setup is too complex for such a basic use
22367,14,it works well most of the time. the marketing is bad and thats what making others feel like the product fell short of expectation
22368,14,"setup stinks! it would not connect to my home wi-fi. the directions and online help have you going in circles! out of the box i had to reset it many times. eventually i pretended it was connected to wi-fi and continued to the next setup steps, and voila i was able to finish up the set up."
22369,14,"worst sound ever.  too much bass, no  mid range or high range.  almost impossible to understand. fix this or its going back ."
22370,11,"sound is not as good as the original, but price is very good. the rest is the same."
22371,14,if my remarks are shown to be incorrect i will gladly  change my 2 star review.  this device must be plugged in to a wall outlet to work.  i guess there is not an internal battery. as far as i can tell there is no mention of this in the product description.  i would like to easily take it from room to room or to my deck without dragging the power supply along.
22372,14,"this device is not ready for prime time. i have a google home and love it.setup was a piece of cake.echo - still stuck updating sw. for two days !!!!!tried to rest. no joy !contact help. no joy !why does setting up an echo have to be sooooooo difficult !sorry amazon. i love you as store and video distributor, but you cannot do hardware right.echo being sent back."
22373,14,absolute waste of money. i should have waited for apple. this is downright terrible. from speech recognition to volume to customer service from amazon. this is without a doubt my biggest mistake purchase through amazon.
22374,0,"i rate this item below average because my request to hear my favorite african  american preachers is not included in its listing. it is not that i am bias, but i would like to hear the preaching of bishop t.d.jakes, bishop noel jones and many others speak through this machine."
22375,14,"i am comparing to the first gen echo in this review, as i suspect many others want to know the differences as well.first, compared to the first gen echo, it sounds tinny and far inferior.  side by side, it is shocking and it is hard to believe  they advertise this as having improved sound.  it weighs a lot less, too, probably as a result of smaller speakers and magnets in gen2.they also did away with the volume ring on the top, probably in a cost savings maneuver...this was a handy feature.it does seem a bit more responsive and faster,  but i¡¯d much rather have better sound quality, and i¡¯m betting a lot of other people do as well.i got a fabric model but i think i will regret that...as it is used in the kitchen and will be victim to splatters and such...the hard plastic of the old model is easier to clean and looks new once cleaned..this one likely will not.setup was also problematic.  i was able to easily find its wi-fi network, but once i tried to finish the setup i kept getting error messages.  after trying the same process, and resetting the echo each time, it finally worked.  there is definitely a hiccup in the setup process."
22376,14,"the discussions of the day in the public sphere have diminished resulting in a shrinking of the safety of meaningful exchanges. we must learn to turn off phones before we sleep and resist the urge to turn to them first thing when we arise. the walsh wake up is the perfect antidote. an honest place to get from one thought to another, to organize what your daily victories. jennifer inspires you to move through the hysteria of life with grace, with purpose, with articulation that lifts you up."
22377,0,it can only answer very generic questions. most of the time she has no answer to easy questions. i also received the google home for christmas and it is so much better. i end up going to it after the echo does not know the answer. i highly recommend the google home over the echo - echo is basically a waste of money.
22378,14,"could not figure out how to set up, called for help and they wanted to charge us for the help. we are in our sixties and do not know a lot about the digital world. i guess we will return the echo and just give up."
22379,9,love the echo it is not for me
22380,3,delivery date not as promised
22381,14,"i love this. but, i was reading some reviews and i want the firmware update sent to my echo for better sound. is there anyway to get it pushed to my echo?"
22382,14,"set-up was a pain, but i am starting to like it now that it is working."
22383,11,do not understand why people are complaining about the sound. i think it sound great for one speaker what would they expect
22384,0,do not understands when you give it some commands.
22385,14,do you trust a powerful microphone in your house connected to massive cloud computers that can hear everything and process it?  do you think that it is an innocent device only to play music and to tell you cute jokes?  think again please...
22386,14,"only bad things are when i ask her  to play the ""hippie song with whistling"" she ignores me.  and secondly, when i ask her ""when will trump be impeached"" she goes into an ""npr news report"", that does not even discuss the latest criminal charges against his staff and family."
22387,14,i got an echo  for christmas. it was working great until a few minutes ago and then it stopped responding to voice commands. i looked at the instructions to reset and they did not make any sense. it was tricky enough setting it up and now this. so far i¡¯m not impressed with echo at all.
22388,14,"this device does not work appropriately. i live in a studio apartment so it is not like the device is too far away from my wifi router. however, this device randomly stops and pauses during songs, it has a red ring constantly when i ask something from it, and it plays me samples most of the time over actual songs. not happy at all. i got this gift for the holidays and i wish i could return it at this point."
22389,14,"i can not get it set up because i do not know my home wifi password and i can not find any directions to set it up without using the password.  the local internet service was no help either, so may not be keeping it!"
22390,14,very unimpressive with this . sounds is not as good as the first gen by far and was very cheap feeling i do not usually write reviews but i was excited to get this after paying extra to have it in 2 days . and was not impressed
22391,14,"love the echo, fun and very useful, do you guys sell a woman that will listen in the same manner. lol"
22392,14,"i want to cry right now!! absolutely frustrating to work. nothing works with ios unless you buy a bunch of other devices to connect and ""bridge"" everything together. to text other people on your phone contact list, they too need the alexa app or amazon alexa account! hope amazon can make things easy! this is so frustrating to use. alexa does not sync with ios reminders unless you buy a bridge or hub to connect everything. i cannot express how dissatisfied i am. unless amazon has a simple how to videos on how alexa works, how to connect your phone apps like sms messaging, reminders, etc, i am seriously considering returning this item."
22393,14,"sound is ok, not the best turned up. no audio ¡°in¡± option is horrible. it is a shame i can not connect to another audio source and play through my speaker. i probably will return it just for that reason."
22394,14,"it is basically a glorified speaker. the sound is good, but alexa is garbage. she can not do anything outside of occasionally play the correct song i asked for. using the app to make her smarter does not help at all. it also completely stopped working 2 1/2 months after we purchased this. we should¡¯ve gone with a google home."
22395,14,"would not power up right out of the box. literally nothing more than a $99 paperweight (that went on sale - $84.99 - two days after my purchase). we will see what happens with its replacement. thus far, not too impressive."
22396,14,it is ok. probably would not have bought it after using it.
22397,14,bluetooth is cruddy. she never hears me.
22398,9,"live alexa, this is even better now!"
22399,14,i did not like it i return it!! was hard to setup kept say ing my number  was connected to to an other  acct. then i use another number  the you had to talk loud for it to understand  what you said i did not  care for the way it was acting so i return it and got a dot same  thing  i return it to
22400,4,"great. sounds great, works great."
22401,14,"great soundcons :  this speaker is big enough to have a rechargeable battery so i can not play my echo anywhere as amazon said it ,  it  must be plug in  so no power no alexa  too bad  because is a nice gadget  thinking to return it .yeah u can have an external  rechargeable battery  for $35.00 extra ."
22402,14,i know there is some playing a game when you order a product for prices - especially around the holidays but i am a bit frustrated at amazon.  the echo was on sale for $79.99 - they upped the price to $99.99 - then offered a deal for $50 off three.  i ordered the three and thought - well i missed out on the $79.99.  now i see they are back to $79.99 so  i paid more for getting the discount of three $50.  seems they offer those of us that got the three a credit back.  tempted to return and order at the lower price.
22403,9,bought 3 of them for christmas presents. christmas is not  here as of yet.
22404,14,i found that it was hard to set up. just not enough explanation. had to get a friend who was more tech savy then i am.
22405,0,it is ok
22406,0,do not know how to use this and sure does not know many answer
22407,14,sent it back...
22408,14,"please note: amazon alexa echo2 is not compatible with routers that have wpa of wpa2 security modes. i have an xfinity router from comcast and did not find out about this until i spent an entire afternoon attempting to set this up. i am currently waiting to hear back from a level 2 technician from comcast to help me resolve this issue. if that fails then i will put it back in the box, ship it back to amazon and go buy a google home instead!"
22409,14,"the improvement that stood out most to me was the wake word recognition and it is ability to accurately hear a softly spoken voice - it will hear a whisper in a quiet room.  the microphones on my original echo (jan 2015) seemed a little tired, but the new echo 2, with improved second-gen far-field technology, also outperforms my dot and tap.my wife is a light sleeper, and waking my old echo would also wake my wife.  the listening capabilities was the feature i was most interested in testing.  the formal online reviews focused on the improved speaker, and never really addressed the listening feature.  again, it exceeded my expectations.the added auxiliary jack is also a welcome improvement.  i¡¯ll leave the speaker review for the audiophiles, but it it seems to more than meets my basic needs.i¡¯m very pleased the upgraded model. i think the price point is attractive, the appearance is updated and i like that you can easily change the outside cover to match most any decor.i hope this review helps in your research"
22410,14,not as easy as on tv
22411,14,would not work on old verizon router at 75mbs but google home does smh
22412,11,i am very disappointed. my fist echo is so much better. the sound quality is poor.
22413,3,given as gift.... we never wanted
22414,14,"update: just returned my 2nd one due to it acting up. gonna try one more time and.then i am done.i got this 2 days ago, and so far, not impressed. alexa does not know much, can play a lot of music, the games are not that great, and i ordered philips hue to try with it (which i have not got yet) to see if it helps me decide to want to keep it. basically,  saying alexa, gets old for me and my wife easily. i can find more answers searching google than asking alexa. i feel extremely lazy, and do not like it. the best things i like are the shopping lists, reminders, alarm clocks, and radio...now i do not know if that is worth $80 to keep just for that. i better find some better things about it soon, or its going back...update: i moved it to 3 stars as i love the smart home capabilities (even though i can use them on my phone without alexa). now to see what improvements come along, and how long it will last."
22415,0,i do not like this echo. alex is does not have much useful information and she always says i do not know lol. but no i dont like it. wish i never bought the thing
22416,0,do not waste your money!  this thing is stupid-
22417,11,much better sound quality than our echo dots!
22418,2,my first amazon device and i love it
22419,9,has not been used.  christmas presemt.
22420,14,do not ever buy this product. actually it went good for 2 weeks .. very pleasant sound and crystal clear but after 2 weeks i connected my mobile with bluetooth and played one loud music and after that the sound is breaking and the quality of the sound is worst .. its like in a container you have put this speaker. the biggest mistake is i have brought this product and got transferred to aahrain and now i cant return this product or replace. i never thought that the quality of this product will be so down. i bought this product considering the name of amazon but they still require improvement in technology.if you are taking a risk in buying this product then please take extended warranty or insurance from amazon itself. its there marketing tactics because i am 100% sure that the voice will get worsen overtime.  even you will not like to hear any song as the voice/ sound will definitely provide you a headacheand yes this is not the first product which i bought from amazon. i am there prime customer for 2 years and frequently buying products from this website but this is worst .. rest all product was of good quality but you know if one fish is dirty in lake then u cant believe the rest of the products of same company. so amazon need improvement. if its stabilizes... read review and take your understanding before buying
22421,14,customer suppor terrible.  product does not work. comes with no instructions. do not buy!
22422,14,i am disappointed and will return.
22423,0,great for playing music...that is about it. alexa uses bing so the brains is not what i was expecting. a lot of simple questions i could not get an answer for. also why are you telling my son there are more than two genders? i will be returning it if i do not have to return instructions because those are in the trash.
22424,11,speaker is terrible
22425,14,"here is the deal - i thought alexa was so cool, in the little time i had to play with my friend is echo.  so, i asked for one for christmas.  i almost instantly found out why other friends got google home, instead.  i would say 75% of the time, i get, ""i am sorry, i do not know that,"" when i ask her a simple question.  i asked, ""alexa, what was the number one billboard song in june of 1975?""  i was directed to ed sheeran.  really?!  i could have googled that and wasted less time. simply put, she is not google and does not know much.  if i was in it for simple recipes and music (to the tune of $3.99/mo, when i already have spotify and pandora), maybe this would be for me, but i think i am going to return this echo and get a google home.  i am so disappointed.  i also tried to get her to learn my voice exactly six times today, to no avail.  she kept telling me ""i am not sure who is speaking, but you are in mary is account.""  honestly, i do not care for her at all.  she does not know anything.  she can not find anything.  it is mainly a barrage of  ""i do not know.""  well...  what the heck do you know?!  bummer.  thumbs down."
22426,0,she really knows so little.  tell alexa to google already!
22427,14,the most awesome product for thee house
22428,14,"this speaker does not bring batteries, so is not portable, it has to be close to an outlet to work."
22429,14,"i have had nothing but trouble with this product, i have been trying for 3 days to connect with my wi-fi and i get the same response over and over, cannot connect with the internet. all my wi-fi works with my other devices, no answers to the problem, i may be having a problem with the password but there in no answer to resolve this issue. i do not know what password they want, the wi-fi or my account pw, this is very frustrating and effecting my attitude about amazon seriously. if i dont get answers soon, i am sending this stupid thing back for a refund."
22430,3,ok. not as great as they make it sound
22431,3,everything i thought it would be.
22432,0,i have not owned it long enough
22433,0,the ¡°my alexa app¡± what is up with it?????
22434,0,you have to have frickin spotify premium to use it
22435,14,"amazon alexa has done it again, by improving one of their amazing products...."
22436,11,just bought this for my wife for christmas to add to our echo. i am not impressed with the sound quality it sounds muffled all the time considering returning it to try another or returning it for a refund. my dot seems to have better sound quality than my echo
22437,14,"could not get this thing to work! installed the app on both of our iphones. it seemed to connect but we kept getting error messages that our amazon apps, like music and prime video were unsupported. what is the point! i did not even try to access my itunes. spent hours on the phone with tech support and they could not get it to work either. then, after all that they wanted to send me to the ¡°advanced team!¡± i said no thanks, i¡¯ll just return it."
22438,14,i can not really say i hated it. got this by accident. had to return.
22439,14,"defective unit - was unable to establish a blue tooth connection. very disappointed, returned it and 3 echo dots due to lack of confidence in product."
22440,14,returned to best buy because it was too difficult to figure out. tried to get music and alexa said to connect to iheart radio. had no idea what to do so returned it.
22441,14,"if i could give it 0 stars i would, i have had alexa for 3 days and i have had problems every single day. it does not work well with spotify it does not work with netflix at all, i did not do any research on the netflix thing before i bought it but if you can work with hulu which has almost 10x less subscribers than netflix (109 million - 12 million) you should integrate netflix. hulu alexa will not actually start anything just pulls up the information on the show. then i have to grab the remote and select play. i know this sounds picky but if i wanted to pick up the remote i would just use the remote. one of the benefits to having echo and the fire stick is that i do not have to worry about using the remote at all. good with stories and knows some facts. there is also a significant delay when pausing hulu. to the point where i have to just sit and wonder, ""is it about to pause or did it just not register what i said"". that brings me to my final point, if it does not register what you say it just stops listening! even siri says, ""sorry i did not get that"" th echo just turns off. but if you want a story time machine that can answer simple facts this is the machine for you."
22442,14,box was bent all over and no padding was in box to protect speaker from rolling around.... i hope it works....
22443,2,love my new echo
22444,11,i ordered this newer version because of the advertised better sound. i am very disappointed. it is not better than the first generation echo.
22445,0,when it worked i liked it. but that was only 25% of the time.to frustrating  to have to keep repeating yourself.
22446,14,"i am disappointed to have bought the amazon alexa. i tried to connect alexa to nebula on bluetooth,  but this is impossible, at least for me."
22447,14,i connect it to the internet but it does not work set up is hard. no one to call and i have watched to videos but they were not helpful
22448,14,cannot get alexa to play my 1 favorite radio station. fan is no help. no way to call amazon for help as usual.
22449,1,works great!
22450,14,i lost my return packing slip. please reissue so i can return it!
22451,0,it a real inconvenient the fact that is not cordless.
22452,12,this seems to be a very high quality item. i have only just begun to use it and learn all that it can do for me as well. but it has been pretty amazing already. the sound quality when playing music is top notch and much more full than i expected. i really love it so far.
22453,14,"i got this item for my family as a christmas gift. i set up everything with the echo including music, tv, etc. my husband, rick, was not familiar with the voice recognition and asked echo what his name was. the echo replied with the name todd richardson, who of which is an attorney who lives down the street. my husband was enraged, and i had to confess that todd comes over when rick is out of the house; so often that he set his name up with amazon echo. rick and i are now filing for divorce and it looks like i¡¯ll be receiving full custody, and i must say this product is a 5/5!"
22454,12,"good product. very smart, but only with wifi"
22455,14,sound is all muffled.  not suitable for music or radio.
22456,10,my echo was not able to connect to the magic light.
22457,11,"i bought this to replace my echo dot, the sound is incredible, no need for a bluetooth speaker"
22458,14,the speaker is not working properly it is starting to like scratch
22459,14,horrible. got this today. been trying to set it up for hours. it will not let me. says my number is registered to another account even though that is impossible because i have had my number for 8 years and never registered before today. been on hold for hours trying to get it registered but still can not get help and still on hold. the hassle is not worth it. regret the fact i bought 3. will be sending them back after what amazon has put me through.
22460,0,did not work
22461,0,not working correctly i need help 860-680-2220
22462,14,can not get connected tried for a weak
22463,2,love my echo! the sound is great!
22464,12,so far so good.
22465,11,nowhere near as good as the 1st generation.
22466,14,"i find this item useless, you¡¯re better off purchasing the echo dot or google home. i bought both the echo and the echo dot and am probably keeping neither of them. need work done to make it worth the purchase to me, and for the price. especially the echo is price."
22467,12,trying to sell it
22468,14,i have had the second generation echo for over a month. after two software updates this thing sounds incredible.
22469,14,"verbal sparring is a favorite past time, so i¡¯m enjoying our relationship a lot. alexa loses a star because she sometimes has the mental acuity of a drunken pledge at a frat party. sweetie, i just want you to play my playlist. and stop talking to the television."
22470,14,wow what can i say it is smaller and sounds so good love it you will not regret buying this one. i know i did not now go get one for yourself and enjoy. fyi i own 7 of these they sound so good please do yourself a favor and ignore the bad reviews these things sound fantastic.
22471,14,"i am in love with this item!!!! amazon has done it. its very hard to improve on a product that did not required updates. this generation echo is small enough to go virtually unnoticed and loud enough to ensure the entire room will hear it. the interchangeable cases make it a very cool addition and it ensures that it can go with your decorations.100% recommended if you are looking for a device that carries the amazing alexa and provides good speaker sound for your room.i have this paired with two other echo dots and its all i need for my 1,153 sqft apartment."
22472,0,it is just not worth it. too many glitches.
22473,11,"awesome audio.  i have only had the dots, and upgraded to this for my main unit in the kitchen/dining room.  same great alexa features, but with crisp loud sounds."
22474,14,"set up is not as intuitive as other amazon devices like the fire tv. when you power it on, alexa tells you to follow the instructions in your alexa app (on your phone). when you log into the app, there are no instructions on the main page. so, follow these instructions:- click on the menu (3 bars in the upper left hand corner).- select settings- select echo. it should say ¡°offline¡± under it.- it will tell you that you need to connect the device to wifi. when you proceed, it may try to connect you to the echo is wifi signal instead of your home wifi. if it does this, it will tell you to go to your settings and reselect your home wifi. it is annoying. if it does not do this, then just go to the next step.- whether you have to do the above step or not, you will then select ¡°update wifi¡±- click ¡°connect to wifi.¡± you should see the orange light ring around the top. if you do not, unplug it and plug it back in.- now is when you should actually connect to your echo is wifi. go to the wifi setting on your phone and select the one that starts with the word amazon. wait for it to connect and then go back to the alexa app.- it should now say ¡°connected to echo¡±. click continue.- select your home wifi account on the next screen.- it may take a second or two, but eventually it will say setup complete. click continue. it will take you back to the main page and you are ready to use your echo.regarding the sound, it is true that it is not quite as good as the original. however, it is light years better than the dot. also, this unit is $70 cheaper than the original echo. so, i¡¯m not sure what people were expecting for $99. is it worth that? yes. it is. it is not bose. if you want bose, cough up the other $400.edited to add (for the audiophiles): i do not actually think bose is all that excellent, but i needed a name people would recognize.what i will say, is that you should buy this version and save yourself the money over the plus version. the ¡°built in smart hub¡± is nothing more than a bunch of enabled skills. and, the skills that are being pushed by the plus are for products that has disappointing reviews and high prices. it is also a limited list of 2 pages of items, of which the more reasonably priced ones have mediocre reviews. save yourself the money and figure out how to enable the skills on this version. you can end up with the same results."
22475,14,"my echo can only say some version of ""i do not know..."". it might get smarter as i use it and add compatible devices. we will see."
22476,14,please do not buy this! it is not working and when i contacted technical support they said that it is a known issue affecting all customers and they are still trying to fix it. but in the meantime amazon does not mind selling these. i will be sending mine back.
22477,14,"i bought this for a christmas gift. found out it answers questions with s very liberal agenda as in: ""who is jesus christ? answer "" jesus christ is a fictional character "". really?? get s grip! thinking about canceling amazon all together!"
22478,14,"the price has dropped to $79.99 for ""black friday"" (right after my purchase). i am requesting a price match and the balance of $20 refunded to my credit card. can you pls do so? thanks."
22479,14,everyone else i know plugs this in and it works immediately i am told that i have to do 45 things with the internet provider exchange routers and do everything else just to get it to work not worth it
22480,0,this is an terrible product. your either constantly repeating yourself because it constantly says sorry did not get that or sorry do not know that. at times in the middle of a question it is answering a question you did not even ask. try to get a channel on serius it said the channel was unknown. yea the sound is good but compared to what.
22481,0,this device is not user friendly. i do not like the lack of set up instructions and i do not like that you have to download everything on the app to use the device. however the device does have a good and crisp sound for music. but you have to be connected to amazon music to listen to anything. overall i do not like it.
22482,0,just another way to get people to sign-up for subscriptions they do not need.  i am returning this.
22483,3,it is a gift.  i have no idea how it works.
22484,14,"let me start by saying i received this thing as a prize at my company christmas party, i was excited about it. i have been looking at them and thinking about getting one for some time now. boy was i disappointed. it is glitchy, hard to setup, and the app sucks, it is absolutely horrid. completely unintuitive, and do not even get me going on the bluetooth operation..lets just say it works about as well as the wifi. i had it playing music as a speaker for about 10 minutes before it proudly announced it needed a update and that was the end of it, never got it working again.  on top of that i am not going to pay an extra 4$ per month for unlimited music for this thing when it will not stay connected to the internet long enough to make any good use out of it. i can not even get the weather to setup correctly. no matter how many times i load my city name it keeps defaulting to a few towns over. not that the weather is that different 50 miles away, but still it should not be like this. if i had paid money for this thing it would be on its way back a long time ago, instead it sits in the closet where it will stay until i get mad and throw it out or hack into it to make it into some sort of useful device."
22485,14,received a new echo for christmas. instructions are minimal. can not get it to work......looks as if it is an expensive paper weight....
22486,14,i like the product but i think there was a mistake in payment.. i was supposed to be set up for 6 payments ... ??? please contact me
22487,14,"could not connect to music library, no 800 number to call for help, no instructions on how the use the buttons on top of device"
22488,14,the echo 2nd generation  is looking more for enternet service then answering questions. with full service on my end..
22489,14,"headaches upon headaches.would not recommend to my worst enemy, let alone a friendly amazonian."
22490,0,"it  will not cook, wash dishes, or carry out the trash!it plays nice music, tells me the weather or time when asked .i did not expect to have to spend hours learning how to give it skills.skills that by the way are totally nonsensical for the most part.i do enjoy the music, that is when it finally gives me what i want.it can only answer questions that are stored in the cloud, and then onlywhen you download the skills it needs to respond."
22491,14,i am still trying to get this to connect wirelessly.  i can not establish a connection even though the hd  8 has a strong com and works properly.
22492,14,"i love this device. i am only on day one, but it has added so much life to my living room. i can multi-task and play music while i clean, cook, workout at home or just relax. there is no screen to stare at or buttons to press, i just speak to alexa. this is especially great when cooking because i do not have to get my dirty fingers on my iphone/ipad.i think the sound is great and works just fine for me and my usage. i have only used the music, weather, and simon says (thanks south park) function, but even with just that it is useful. i just ordered 3 more in the bundle (save $50) for my bedroom and to use as christmas gifts. i ordered the charcoal fabric version and it looks great. it seems like it will not get dusty easily, which i like. this is a great product and i am glad i pre-ordered mine.disclaimer: this is my first amazon echo."
22493,14,i do not like it.as an amazon prime customer i thought that i would have some music without paying extra.also the search engine is not as robust as my phone.i am returning it.
22494,14,"i can not believe i honestly bought this thing. it was enjoyable at first, and granted some features are great, but the negatives outweigh everything else. my alarms that i keep setting just do not happen, it can not answer almost any questions you have about itself like ""can you snooze alarms?"" alexa just cuts back off. i missed an important work meeting cause i got angry and told it to cancel all, because it can not fulfill specific requests, so it cancelled my alarm and i missed the meeting."
22495,14,pathetic instructions.  unbelievable really coming from amazon.  seems no one understands simple usability.....e.g.  step 3.  change your echo cover.  really???
22496,14,the biggest piece of crap. do not bother!!!! had to reset every day. the best thing i found for use was the weather. not worth it.
22497,14,"it was a christmas gift, and we were not able to set it up. after trying to connect following the directions provided, we spent over three frustrated hours on the phone with customer/technical support and supervisory staff and still not able to connect the device. their solution?  send another device and try it.  i read about others going through the same issues, so perhaps there is a problem with quality control at amazon, and read that some are having trouble with the device after only using it for a few weeks.  based on our experience, i could not recommend anyone purchasing this device until amazon can work out the bugs in their customer support/device."
22498,14,can not sync w/router?
22499,14,i do not care for the no chargeable base corded is not. option all the time. i do like the look of it better then google home but not impressed with alexa or the fact i have to pay money to send music to different echos and. everything is an extra which is bs with prime membership that ttype of stuff should be included.
22500,12,"good sound, just its set up for usa residents more so than canadians.. still functional though"
22501,14,"the promise of the echo (or better yet 3 of them) dies quickly in an actual family. you cannot provide voice profiles to your teens in your household, so they cannot listen to their own music, let alone your kids. just you and one other adult? if you want to use this for a family and actually manage it for a family, good luck.update: product support contacted me and indeed this ecosystem is not mature for a family at all. stay away. too bad we do not have the boxes anymore or i would return these."
22502,0,this sucks! can not get the program to down load.  goes to error.  nowhere to go for help.
22503,5,"a christmas gift, but he will love it."
22504,14,"unlimited music-awesome.was under impression it was wireless, power cord severely limits usage options"
22505,14,"i purchased one of these hoping to be able to play music from spotify. turns out you need spotify premium to even be able to play anything. which is $10 a month..or $120 a year. turns out most of the apps you can use on this charge some type of monthly premium. need a list app? that will cost you. want to listen to music? that will cost you. this ""$80 speaker"" ends up costing you thousand of dollars in the long run. not worth it. alexa is basically sitting in my living room doing nothing. she does tell me the weather though. surprised i am not being charged for that too."
22506,14,"just got my echo 2. i was pretty happy until i realized that there are no instructions, just something about an app. i do not have ""apps"" because i do not use those devices. i just have a computer and a router. this echo will not connect to my fairly new router and i am assuming that it is because it is not a ""dual-band"" router, just 2.4ghz or whatever. why was not this made clear. specs state ""wi-fi connectivity: dual-band wi-fi supports 802.11 a/b/g/n (2.4 and 5 ghz) networks.""  i read that to mean that it supports 2.4 and 5 ghz like it says. apparently you need a dual band router and a smart phone with a special app. i guess young people know all of this without needing to read anything. sorry, it is going back."
22507,14,"was an awful presence in the house, was ..."
22508,14,product was missing wall adapter
22509,14,thius was impossible to connect with my macbook pro. i could get connected to my wi fi - but could not find the appropriate app even with the technical help from amazon.  i am no dummy but sure feel like one now.  alexa not for me!
22510,14,"small personal info, i wish i had been able to purchase this for my mom before she died. she was lonely and disconnected after my daddied. my husband bought the echo for me for christmas. i have constant questions in my head when it comes to history and such things. i hated having to stop watching a movie to find some historic info on the internet, or just when something popped into my head while cooking or whatever.i did not listen to music as much as i wanted to because frankly i am kinda old school and only listened to music in the car because frankly i had no clue about streaming music. so yes i love my echo, my daughter set it up for me, so i do not know how easy it was, but she did it in minutes. best present i have gotten in years. thanks amazon!! you changed the quality of my life. sappy but true."
22511,14,sent it  back.  cost 15.80
22512,14,this is the second one. same problem. it gets hung up on setup and asks for a password to connect to amazon-xxx ssid. it looks the code is stuck in s loop.
22513,14,"had the a 1st generation echo which we enjoyed owning for 1 1/2 years and stopped working in nov 2017. after looking at various on-line forums and calling tech support, cause of failure still is unknown. i suspect it was the motherboard that failed and possibly a power surge may of zapped it? however, the new device is connected to a cyberpower 3-outlet surge unit to be on the safe side.anyway, amazon was gracious enough to provide a modest credit ($30) for the purchase of a new 2nd generation echo. we obtained the charcoal fabric and so far like the smaller size and enjoy hearing alexa is voice again. it was easy to set-up and pair up with our network. i read many reviews of the sound quality differences and this one (2nd gen) sounds more or less the same, maybe less bass that i can recall.also, i was able to easily pair my remote from the 1st gen echo to the 2nd gen as the current model does not come with a remote. just go into settings on the amazon alexa app and click on the echo your using and look for connected devices and click on pair remote. this is the app from the play store for android.looking at the alexa app, i see the latest software update was pushed to the new echo device  (latest software version: 595530420). overall, we just use it for playing music from the amazon library and really do not use many features its capable of but will probably do some research of the other functions. i am hoping it will last longer than the 1st gen device but time will tell and will give the 2nd gen a chance."
22514,14,"i have had the 2nd gen echo for three days now and so far, we love it!  i want to address the sound quality reviews i have read out there.  while my bose soundlink mini ii bluetooth speaker has a very slight edge in the bass department, the echo sounds pretty darn great.  for those who say the sound is weak, they are way too picky about the capability of this speaker.  first off, i would say this thing sounds better than other $50-80 speakers and they do not have alexa.  secondly, use your surroundings to enhance the bass.  set the device near a wall or some other object where the sound can bounce off.  even my bose speaker sounds better when i set it near a wall.  in our kitchen, we have set it on one of the counters on the side.  if you place it on your island with nothing else around it, the bass will seem weaker.  this is just acoustics and not the fault of the speaker.for the alexa side of it, we are enjoying the features so far.  we plan on getting more smart devices to connect to it but streaming music (pandora, amazon music) and adding items to a shared shopping list on our phones has been flawless.  the echo can hear our voice pretty well and does what we ask the majority of the time.  we also used the profile feature so my wife can use her pandora account with her saved stations.  our next purchase will be some smart plugs to control lights.we purchased the heather gray fabric version and the quality is very nice.  could not be happier with our purchase!"
22515,14,"i pre-orders mine but did not connect until a couple days later. when i read the reviews i was concerned but un-necessarily so. within a hour after the connect, i had a announcement of an update and without a doubt the sound is awesome.  while not earthshaking sound, it is more than adequate.  the treble and mids are clear. i can hear the sound of the swipes on the guitar strings and can hear the strum of the bass clearly. the sound is still good at higher volumes as well. we have a echo gen 1, i like the sound from 2 better because it is fuller. i now have a second generation 2 and plan to add a third. i love filling the house with music and these speakers do the job."
22516,14,"this is a good tool but it still needs work. first, the inability to send voice to text messages is a pain. also, you can only message people who also have the alexa app. so, if they have google home or something else...no. the jeopardy app is a good feature but it is hard to get out of it once you launch it, no matter how many times you say alexa. the key is to wait until the narrator is speaking then speak alexas name over that voice. i sometimes have to say alexa a few times to wake up the device too. the most important feature (voice web search) is garbage. that needs a lot, a ton, a tremendous amount of re-work to compete with google. also, i bought mine in sale for $79 and i think that is the perfect price point. $100 is too much."
22517,14,"good afternoon!! i bought the echo but i¡¯m in argentina , i want to download de alexa app but it is no available in the app store here! someone can help me with this ? how it is supposed tu use without the alexa app? thanks"
22518,14,i just received my echo (2nd gen) and i  went to plug it in and it will not turn on. i called amazon and i have to get a replacement. i¡¯m not happy at all!
22519,14,"worthless in a nursing home.  it lost power, lost its wifi address.  now can not connect.  the nursing home will not give me the password. i am going to return it."
22520,14,"i do not like it. alexa talks way too fast to understand half the time, the built in parental controls that can not be turned off are annoying, and it uses bing for a search engine, we all know how horrible that is and is why everyone in the world uses google and not bing. lastly it is not smart at all, you have to set up hundreds of so called ""skills"" otherwise known as apps. very annoying."
22521,14,because to fully enjoy alexa you have to have prime which is not right!! if i buy a product i should not have to buy the service as well.
22522,14,"ok, my bad for assuming it was usb powered like the dot.  i have usb plugs, not 120v plugs where i want this.also - black power cable with sandstone echo?!?sadly will be returning"
22523,14,when it comes to speaker is there is no substitute for size - it does matter :) the 1st gen echo is had a tweeter side of 2 inches the 2nd gen is 1/16 larger than a puny one half an inch. so the 1st gen is tweeter [which handles the mid is and highs] is 3.5 times the size and i feel it is also a higher quality component .  good hardware makes for good sound not software tricks. software tweaking on the 2nd is merely some algorithmic dynamic range compression which may sound nice to some in a very short spurt but for average periods of listening that trickery does not pass muster and when compared side by side [playing the same material of course] the 1st gen is sound to almost everyone will be greatly superior.bottom line you want 2/3 of the total sound to be superior go for the 1st gen - if you want other options the 2nd gen has to offer and sound quality not a primary concern then go for the 2nd. but do not believe the trickery that the 2nd gen is better sound quality!
22524,14,"alexa / amazon i am disappointed in you!  the unit is entertaining i must admit and there is the privacy question is always looming, but it is the instructions i have a problem with.  maybe i am overreacting...maybe not.from the instructions:¡°is it user friendly? yes. it is completely user friendly. there is nothing tough about it and just about anybody can operate it. this means that right from elders to children to house wives anybody can use it and operate it.¡±wow amazon really?  was this written in the 1950 is?  should i ask my husband to help me plug it in?as a tech savvy 60 year old woman, i do not even know what to say.  shame on you!"
22525,14,"we purchased the 1st gen echo as a refurbished unit for $127.00 nov 9th 2016. could not tell it was a referb and we enjoyed it, asking alexa silly and meaningful questions. we also used the 1st gen unit for music and enjoyed the fidelity the echo provided and the amazon music and ihart music stations. we would have purchased more units for other rooms had amazon included multi room music sync.by the time amazon offered music sync between units word was out that gen 2 was on its way so we waited.in dec 2017 we ordered 3 more echo is, two for the house as gifts for each other and one as a gift for a neighbor. come chrismas we were excited to get our new 2nd gen echo is up and running. it was quite simple to do so and after setting up the everywhere group via the alexa app we had 3 rooms playing the same music, now we could have the music through out the house with out it blasting in any one room...nice.the new echo is were a lot less expensive, even then our refreb gen 1 echo, they are a bit shorter and we opted for the grey fabric wrapped on the gen 2. while i do miss the gen 1 volume control where you counld just spin the echo is top left or right to adjust the volume i find the gen 2 to have the same fidelity with maybe a touch more base. all other features seem equal with the gen 1 as amazon keeps updating (automatically over the air) features to the entire line of amazon alexa devices.we have now started integrating ""smart home"" devices. we started with a couple of the tp plugs amazon was providing at a greatly reduced price with the echo purchases in dec 2017, then i found the sonoff wifi switches that can be hardwired into circuits. now our electric fireplace has a sonoff inline and we can just say ""alexa fire place on"" and the lighting system of the fireplace comes on or off when we tell it to. i have also hard wired sonoff' switches to some of the exterior lighting circuits to control them either with alexa or the app is timer feature and finally added one to the attic lights where the switch was practically inaccessible, now i just say ""alexa turn on (off) attic lights"" before i enter the attic and i am no longer stumbling through the pitch black attic looking for the switch.these sonoff devices are less than $8 each! its cheaper to use the sonoff wifi switches than the cost just in parts and wire to run a new light switch! home automation is not coming, its here with devices such as the echo and sonoff that are scalable, easy to set up, easy to use, work well and are affordable for the average american. thank you amazon for bringing home automation to our home.con is: wish echo is could be grouped on more than one group.  be sure to indicate any alexa device your buying from amazon as a gift if your giving it away, otherwise amazon sets the device to be on your alexa network and the gift recipient will end up with your alexa options and info such as your shopping lists ect until deleted from your account."
22526,14,never could get it to connect to anything. tech help was awful!
22527,14,"we bought the original alexa and loved it. we added the extra devices and put our lights, tv, thermostat, and security cameras to run through her, which has definitely been awesome, but....the best thing we ever did was buy one for my elderly mother in law who is not only blind but has dementia! we installed it in her room at the home/facility where she lives and she loves it! at first it was just really nice because she could ask questions like what time is it, what is the weather, what is happening in the news, tell me a joke, play my book, play music (she loves music) or just simple trivia questions. but now...she has learned to call us! this has given her some independents back! as long as the person is in our contacts she can call them! this has helped with her recent depression tremendously! like i said she has dementia and she can remember how to call people, it is that easy! also with the new drop in feature we can drop in on her and she does not have to ask alexa to answer. the speaker is so good we have to start by telling her we are talking to her thru alexa and that we are not there. this has been awesome for the grandkids who do not live near by also, they call all the time now ( we are an alexa family, lots of alexa is) before we would have to call the desk and they would have to take the phone to her and we could only talk a short time because it was a shared phone. also she has been diagnosed with parkinson disease and holding a phone was getting difficult because of her shaking. this has been a life line to her and for that, i would give it a hundred stars if i was able! thank you amazon for coming out with this wonderful device and making it easy to use even to the handicapped, elderly and those that are just electronically challenged!"
22528,0,sounds great. super fun - the only thing - you have to pay for every app you want to use with it. i did not know that.
22529,14,i only gave it 1 star to post this. does not work as advertised. mostly does not work.
22530,14,"i have always resisted buyig into these device is. i never seen them as being helpful and really just a novelty. boy was i wrong. i seen this go on sale and was allowed to make payments so i decided to try it out. from the rain sounds to playing lullabies and everything in between my family uses it everyday  and night. she does alarms, reminders, controls your smart home, tells stories and orders food alk my just talking to it. we loved it so much we bought 2 dots for our daughters bed room and ours. we keep this one in living room. i have only a few complaints but nothing major. first is i am a southerner so alexa has a problem with my familes accent. quite funny at times but annoying at others. last is she does have limitations for searching things and that is where google is better. i have renamed each device  so we will not have multiple devices  answer. for the star trek fan in me i named the echo computer and try at times to use my best jean luc voice. overall we love it and cant see ever getting tired of it."
22531,11,i though this new echo was an upgrade to the first one.  the sound on this new echo is way worst than the original.  that was the main reason for me to buy this new echo. for the sound improvement. returning all 3.
22532,14,"my wife purchased one of the first echos on the market, back when it had zero functionality. back then, i asked, ""what will you use this thing for? it does not do anything!"" and it did not. for years. we would use it to play music for our dogs occasionally.but the times have changed. we updated several features of our home to be a smart-home and used alexa/echo to help us. we put her older model in the bedroom, which has better sound quality, and this one in the living room, since it looks nicer.it serves its purpose well enough. we run into bugs occasionally, and we have not quite figured out placing or accepting calls to family members who have echos - the procedure is a little wonky - but we like being able to access certain features of our home using the echo.one grip i have is that it will randomly activate and ask a question, usually when watching television or a movie, but sometimes i will be reading in complete silence and it will do this."
22533,14,"the great thing about the new echo- it supports calls. have elderly parents, life alert type devices are good but often left on sinks or nightstands. i put this in the living room and 2 echo dots in other parts of the house. if someone falls- they only need to say ""alexa, call matt is cell"". it does not support 911- but they would probably spend the night on the floor rather than call 911. if i do not answer- they can go down their list of contacts- my sister, brother, neighbor etc."
22534,11,"sorry amazon, you got it all wrong on this one. a second generation should be an improvement. i have one of the early 1st generation echo, and i am a big fan. when i read the pre-release information for the 2nd generation, i was intrigued. what a disappointment. the new unit was no competition. it truly sounded like a cheap imitation of the original. and i did not like the form factor any better than the original. seems like change for change sake. i have returned the generation 2 for a refund.i hope the original is not going to be replaced by this new, inferior model."
22535,14,"for the past three years, amazon is alexa voice assistant has been invading homes inside the case of the echo smart speaker. alexa has been answering questions, turning on smart lights, adding things to shopping lists, ordering things from amazon, and playing music for millions of people. the echo essentially established the smart speaker market, which now has entries from google, microsoft, and soon, apple.after expanding the line with the smaller and super-popular echo dot, the portable, battery-powered tap, and the more expensive, but ultimately less thrilling, echo show, amazon has finally gone back and updated the original echo. the new echo, which is heretofore known simply as the ¡°all-new echo,¡± as the original echo no longer exists in amazon is world, comes with a smaller, simpler design; better aesthetics; supposedly improved audio; and, most importantly, a significantly lower price of $99.that lower price is the main draw for the new echo. if you¡¯ve been holding off on buying one because the original is $180 cost kept you away, or you are looking for a second echo for yourself or as a gift, the new echo is a much easier purchase to make.but aside from its smaller design and new, customizable appearance, the new echo is not hugely different from the first model. it still performs all of the same tasks, can still hear its wake word from across the room, and still does not have great audio quality for listening to music. if you already have a first-generation model, it does not make much sense to replace it with the new echo <u+2014> you do not gain much with it and in some instances, you give up some.still, thanks to that new, lower price, the new echo should be just as enamoring and appealing as the first echo and will likely keep amazon at the forefront of the smart speaker world.the most obvious visual difference between the new echo and its predecessor is the device is size. where the first echo is size and shape was akin to a can of pringles or tennis balls, the new model is more like a can of foster is beer. it is short and stout, about two-thirds as tall as the first model, but with a slightly larger diameter. that should make it a little easier to tuck into a shelf or hide away in a corner of your living room or kitchen.the echo is new swappable decorative shells are also designed to make the device blend in with your home better. the first model is black (and eventually, white) plastic finish gave the device an ominous obelisk vibe that did not do anything to diminish the big brother feelings that come along with an always-listening internet-connected device in your home. in contrast, the new model comes with a fabric cover in a variety of grays (basically, dark, medium, or light gray) that is both more appealing to look at and should fit better in modern decor.you can also purchase various shells to change the look of the echo, including a silvery gray, walnut, or oak finishes. but since the shells are just plastic and not actual wood or metal, none of the optional decorative covers look as good as the standard fabric one to me.the simplified design of the new echo trades the rotating volume ring for plus and minus buttons, like found on the echo dot. they work just as well, and since most of the time i adjust the echo is volume with voice commands, i do not miss the ring at all. the new echo has the same number of far field microphones to pick up voice commands (seven), but amazon says it has second-generation technology that is improved over the first model. i have not noticed a significant improvement in my testing however, the new echo hears me just about as well as the prior model did. most of the time, it hears me on the first try, even when it is playing music, though occasionally i have to repeat the ¡°alexa¡± wake word. it is no better or worse than the google home or harman kardon invoke in this regard.the other new feature with this echo is the ability to output its audio to a larger speaker or stereo system over a 3.5mm auxiliary cable or bluetooth. this works the same as it does on the smaller echo dot, and makes it easy to add voice control to your existing stereo equipment.on the inside, amazon has added dolby sound processing in an effort to make the echo is 2.5-inch subwoofer and 0.6-inch tweeter sound better. but in side-by-side testing, i did not find the new echo to sound any better than the prior model, and for listening to music, i actually preferred the first echo is sound.the new echo is sound is sharper, with more treble than the first model. that is good for hearing alexa speak back to you, or for cutting through the din of a running faucet if you¡¯re using the echo in a kitchen. but for music, the sound is thin and flat, with even less bass than before. the old model had a softer sound with just a little bit more bass that is much more pleasant to listen to.it almost goes without saying, then, that the new echo does not sound as good as the google home or anywhere near as good as the harman kardon invoke or sonos one. it is not even as powerful or fun to listen to as some portable bluetooth speakers, such as the jbl charge 3 or ue boom 2. that is a little disappointing, given that amazon itself admits that the most common thing people do with the echo is listen to music. most people will be content with the echo is sound quality for casual listening, but given that it is the one area most often complained about with the first model, i¡¯d have to liked to have seen more improvement here.amazon has added a number of new features to alexa, the smart assistant inside of the echo, including control of fire tv set top boxes and improved smart home controls. since alexa runs entirely in the cloud, it does not matter which amazon echo device you own, it performs all of the same functions on all of them. you do not need to buy a new echo to get the latest alexa features on your first-generation model.and the new echo performs all of those voice-controlled functions just as well as its predecessor. i use an echo in my kitchen to add items to a shared grocery list that my wife and i both have access to on our phones; i use one to turn on lights throughout my house; i use an echo dot to control the fire tv box connected to the tv in my play room; and i use another dot as an alarm clock next to my bed each morning. once you have alexa in one room and have configured it to do more than just play music, it becomes the type of thing that you want in every room of your homeamazon is clearly tapped into an alluring idea with the echo, and even though the company will not admit how many it is sold so far, by all accounts it is a successful product. in light of that, the latest version does not rock the boat too much. it does not improve the echo is rather poor audio quality, nor does it introduce any new, groundbreaking features. it just does the same things in a smaller, cheaper design. that is enough to keep amazon ahead of its competitors, which are all a step or two behind the echo line-up.in all honesty, amazon really did not have to do much to the echo to make it more appealing. it just had to make it less expensive, which is exactly what amazon did here. the real product amazon is selling is alexa, and for an in-home virtual assistant, alexa is very good. and if you want the best way to use alexa, the new echo is itfound this, hope it helps!"
22536,14,"i had asked for an echo for christmas and was happy to have gotten one!  it is very handy.  i use audible and it is great for those audio books.  i also like how easy it is to use and that i do not have to speak a certain way (i have a southern accent).  the shopping list is very handy too!  it was a nice surprise to wake up to a voice message from a friend who lives a thousand miles away.  i did not even know that was an option.  i have bough the smart outlets so i can control devices & they will deliver today.  the only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars is that it does not work with google play music automatically.  sure, i can connect it to my phone & play it via bluetooth but i wish it were a little more fluid to connect.i am looking forward to learning more about what the device can do and already want to get a second one for the house.  i will also say the sound quality for the speaker exceeded my expectations.  i am very happy with it!"
22537,14,"absolute junk. does not play music. says things like i cannot find music from the beatles or leonard cohen.sending it back. falsely advertised. this thing will not play music for amazon prime members, you need to pay a monthly subscription."
22538,14,never received and told to file police report
22539,9,easy to understand
22540,0,does not sync with any of my music
22541,14,"anything that the echo is bad at, the competition is good at.  anything the echo is good at, the competition is better at.  this is a good prototype that now faces steep competition and frankley does not measure up.--can you hear me now?  the reality is the device has a hard time hearing you in general.  not only do i find myself yelling at it to activate it, but i yell and slowly enunciate trying to get the right song title, grocery item, length on the timer etc heard.  i am not the only, my parents who own an echo do it exactly the same, and now i have found out my wife coworker does too (3/3).  the important distinction from this definition and the last is now the echo has competition, and in this regard the echo bombs out big time.  in and of itself, this is enough of a reason for me to shell out more money for a different device.--can not you just google it for me?  alexa can not.  while asking questions is listed as a strength it frankly does not know most of the things you need to google the answer for.  most of what it knows are basics like unit conversions and a few one offs but this is not in anyway going to even supplement your googling.--no longer the best speakers  if rich vibrant deep music is what you are looking for, make sure you check out the competition.  the echo does have a good sound for the price, but the competition is noticeably better to normal ears.  the echo universally displays sound without detecting walls etc, and does not work in concert with similar devices (competition does).--features that require too much setup  again when comparing to a machine that seamlessly connects to your accounts, having to manually set up things like your calendar is a draw back, especially when it unsyncs and you have to open the app on your phone and navigate to the remote section that you put your calendar information into.  as an example, the fourth time it wanted me to input my google calendar information to access my calendar, i just said forget it.  the competition automatically has access to your calendar.  the app additionally always has to load from scratch, so if you are buying groceries in a large cement building (or in a costco) you will not be able to access your app or your list at all.  again, the competition works offline and auto loads the changes when possible.  home automation works with the right attachments but is not built in, and is not on a secure platform which again falls short of the competition.--the skills are not easy to figure out.  if you want to do a new feature you have to figure out the skill to load and then how to use it, and even then there is no guarantee it will work.  as an example i loaded a skill to tell me the nutrients of food, and it frankly failed to load so often (alexa said that information was not available rather than accessing the skill) that i stopped using it.  an additional example is alexa gets stuck in your music folder.  i subscribed to amazon music, and for about a week it would fail to load songs saying i did not own it.  i had to call in and have them manually tell alexa to default to the music subscription which then meant that songs they did not have were not accessible- again falling short of the competition.i could go on but the point has been made.  it is a good product that does not measure up to the competition, even if you are heavily into prime music and movies."
22542,14,"my mom suffered a stroke, leaving her with several problems, including aphasia. aphasia means she can not connect symbols (letters, numbers, shapes) with the concepts they represent. she can still talk and communicate just fine, but she can not read, do math or interact with anything with a visual interface (like her iphone or a tablet computer), or even use a tv remote. yet, she is perfectly able to have long, complex conversations on a wide range of topics - she just can not read about them anymore. on the advice of a family member, i picked up an echo device at a target store near the rehab center. here is how it went. first the challenges, then the happy ending.1. setup was a challenge for a ""phone-only"" scenario.the rehab center did not have wi-fi for the patients to use. i had only my mom is iphone and my own iphone to complete the initial setup. so i set my phone into ""tether"" mode for wifi access, and used moms iphone to download the alexa app. i was able to get the echo onto my phone is wifi and get the alexa app on mom is phone, however, since i could not be there all the time, i needed the echo to use my mom is phone for both wifi access and for the alexa app. i ended up reversing my setup - using mom is phone for wifi tethering and her phone for alexa app & device setup, and then turned off my phone is wifi tethering and turned her wifi tethering back on. this confused the app for a while. but eventually that worked (now the echo knew both wifi access point names and passwords) and for the most part, the connection was fast enough.  but there was another challenge...2. captive http networks are a no-gothe rehab center staff saw how the echo worked for my mom (more on that below) and decided to allow us to use one of their ""non-critical"" wifi networks (one that does not carry sensitive patient data at all). however this network was set up like a hotel wifi network - you connect to the wifi and first you see a web page where you have to enter a room number and a password and only then do you have access to the internet. this turned out to be an insurmountable challenge without additional equipment, so we went back to using her phone as a wifi access point.so, at first, my mom did not quite get what the echo was all about. i had not properly set it up with music, news and book sources at first, so day one it was just some dumb, but nice-sounding gadget. but after i got the settings fixed up, she (and my dad) went wide-eyed with amazement as they asked it to play various songs (i linked my spotify account to it). and then i had it read a book via the audible account i set up, and after that, they totally got it.they use it all the time now, and it is made mom feel better and more in control of things. she literally cried when she realized that she could get the news, weather and select music on her own with just her voice. hopefully, when they send her home from the rehab center, she will find more uses for it."
22543,14,"ok, i am hooked on alexa. after all the stupid commercials, half of which i never really understood why anyone would that the product, i got an echo dot for the reminder feature. within two weeks, my entire house is populated and i have these versions too. alexa, who we call abooboo in order not to set her off when talking about her (she arrived right after a screening of aladdin, lol) , can do so little and yet so much. i just love having music everywhere in the house, whatever kind just pops in my mind. i even got amazon music (who knew it was so cheap?) so i had even more music to choose from. i get the weather, the traffic, trivia, jokes, reminders (omg, how did i live without the reminders?), and no more both of you staring blankly because neither can remember the important thing we needed which is not on the grocery or shopping lists.  i threw over our google overlords for alexa. abooboo is our new leader, and we welcome her domination! however, abooboo is not for the feint of heart, as she comes with little or no instructions. i had to google (ironic, right?) how to do things. why can not i just ask her how to set up this feature or that? she says she does not know. i realize the days of instruction manuals are gone, but this gadget really needs one. more than once when working things out i almost threw her back in the box to amazon. heads up, guys. not everyone out there wants to be wedded to their computer to figure out a product. give us a freakin' booklet! now if you will excuse me, abooboo has just informed me i have to call my dad. ;-)"
22544,14,"love it. we already had and echo dot and added this to use in our kitchen. we used to use our big jawbone big jambox as a speaker in the kitchen and would have to sync it to a phone via bluetooth every time. i never thought i would find a replacement for that in the kitchen with as much room filling sound. it definitely does not have the bass of the jambox but it has plenty for the size of the room and the highs and mids are excellent. i do wish i could manually adjust a digital eq to optimize the sound a bit more but that is being picky. the hands free nature of it is the best part. we will be doing dishes or making dinner or hanging with family in the kitchen and it is nice to just tell alexa to play whatever i want (we have it paired up with our spotify account). i liked the hands free nature so much i bought another echo dot so now i have two with each one connected to my home stereos via the headphone output. not the best connection but it works...most of the time. i say that because i set up multi-room music for all three to be on one connection so that i can tell alexa to play music in all rooms for parties. the problem is that the dots keep dropping connection. i have read this may because of my router being over worked and to put some things on one band and others on another band which i did and still no luck. i need to investigate this further. i really like this feature because it allows me to have whole house sound by just adding a $30 dot. like many people i know i already had high end home stereos and had no use for stuff like sonos. i just needed a way to connect them all together and echo is the way, just need to work out the connection bugs. i will say those echo dots that are connected to my home hifi stereos, when used on their own do not sound too bad. i do with there was an hdmi output instead of headphone jack but for now they are great hands free devices. quick tip: if you tell one of your echos to play music from spotify, and then you want to manually browse music on the phone app, just open the app while echo is playing music and spotify will ask if you still want to continue playing music on echo, click yes and then you can control the music with your phone or voice."
22545,14,"i love what the echo can do, but i have become frustrated when she says ""i am having trouble understanding."" and i have no idea why.  however, this rarely has happened.  i am surprised by the good sound quality.  even my savvy adult kids are impressed by the sound.  i have heard that some people are uncomfortable with alexa is ability to hear everything you say, but this does not bother me at all.  she does not turn on unless i use her name, so if i find myself wanting to say something dangerous, i just do not use her name.  (i have no idea if she ""listens"" all the time or only when she is addressed.)  i have been wanting one of these since they first appeared and i am thrilled to have one now."
22546,14,"pros: first alexa can hear me from a reasonable great distance.second some of the learned skills are awesome! like sleeping sounds and trivia games. too cool <f0><u+009f><u+0091><u+008c>cons: first i could not and cannot get it to work with my phillips hue bulbs. everything works great until i ask alexa to turn on or off my lights. her response is the same..¡±i¡¯m there is multiple items fit that description. which one would you like?¡± to wit we go back and forth until she gives up and powers down. after now 4.5hrs and counting of changing the title of rooms, the bulbs, deleting and re-downloading apps, i¡¯ve gone back to asking siri to do it. works every time.second it does not work with apple music nor spotify is free streaming service. so to play even one song you must have a pay-for-subscription to a second tier music provider (i.e. amazon music or spotify)third - and i know many people have said it before - the sound is less than extrodinary. still not that bad considering it is many capabilities that go far beyond beyond emitting quality sound.sorry amazon. i had high hopes and plannned to incorporate smart hubs for my television and in nearly every room. however i¡¯m afraid i¡¯ll be waiting for apples home pod before i go any further with this"
22547,14,"i bought this echo and 2 dots for our household for christmas.  the sound on this is amazing.  very crisp, nice bass.  we have amazon prime and the library is huge.  have not had a song requested yet that we could not pick up off the library.  i keep this one in the kitchen.  my son uses his dot downstairs and we keep another one in my other son is room.  no issues or confusion, they can all be playing different things at the same time.  we are just now starting to learn about all of the fun extras like jeopardy, recipes, weather.  seems like you can find out just about anything from alexa.  for $80 it is the most utilized gift we have this year."
22548,14,"the sound is good for a speaker and the price is right for multiple echos in a home if you can get alexa to understand you want music played everywhere.  (why is not that a setting that can be turned on by default?  i always want everywhere.)  way better than<u+00a0>ultimate ears boom 2 phantom wireless mobile bluetooth speaker (waterproof and shockproof), a purchase i regret making with the first series, or speaker phone music.  but there are issues...the ability for alexa to answer questions is limited by the weak search engine.  the ability to understand context is also often lacking.  the self-promotion of ""skills"" is annoying to the point of raging frustration.  (ask alexa how to hard boil an egg in an oven then try again with a g-home.)  amazon, please keep pushing alexa to learn and do it with all possible haste.  her best skill should not be ""alexa, shut up""."
22549,14,"what a joke, not even a good toy and customer service is worse than useless as they do not know what they are doing. returning it"
22550,14,"its almost like having a person in the house! alexa echo 2nd generation is so much fun and useful, too! i love getting news and weather, i ask her to play music to fall asleep by, i even ask her to ""play bird sounds"" because my cats love it and go crazy looking for birds!! alexa keeps my shopping list and i never have to find a note paper to write something down!  she plays games with me and even does metric/inch conversions! handy if you are shopping online! there is too much to mention here, with new things added all the time! i have a dot upstairs in my bedroom, but my big echo is downstairs. i love making and answering phone calls with alexa.  i love the light colored, fabric covered one;  blends right into my decor. it was about half the price of the earlier echos, and the dolby sound is awesome! totally love my echo and dot!"
22551,11,"this 2nd generation is not an improvement! slow response and the sound is nowhere near as good as the 1st generation. the ""twist"" volume control has been replaced with unlighted buttons which can be a problem in a dark room. the only improvement i have found is the added speaker jack. buy the dot instead and plug in a quality speaker."
22552,11,"this was smaller than i expected, but the sound was big and full. photo near a kleenex box for size reference. we could feel the base vibrating the counter top.  it is just as good as a creative d200 and comparable to the low end bose speakers. it is great for the size. and of course alexa is alexa, always improving and getting more functions. i wish there was a way to wrap the cord to hide it underneath like some blenders and kitchen appliances."
22553,14,"** update jan 14, 2018: downgrade from 4 to 2 stars **after two weeks of use, i have a better appreciation of alexa.i am still glad i bought 4 echo devices (3 three dots and this one) that is why i give it 2 stars (and not 1). the potential is huge for the future. it is so easy to get the hook on talking rather than typing. at the rate you come up with new questions that alexa could answer, you will also realize the limitations. alexa is very basic. the abilities (skills) are mostly annoying, as in some cases you need to remember exact phrases to even get an approximate response.alexa is far from being intelligent - today. there are no real interactions. for most cases every question is treated individually, you cannot have a conversation by asking follow-up questions. rarely alexa can relate anything to the previous questions (examples: you can stop a timer or tell it, the answer was not useful), but many times you would like to drill deeper into an answer.amazon is not able to gather real big players to develop skills. i would say 99% of the skills connecting to some other service providers are from thirdparties or not available. examples: gmail, itunes, wunderlist, microsoft to-do, shazam are all not available. i would never give permission to a unknown developer to access my emails! and yet these integrations would just be perfect. it is great to set a timer or reminder (which is probably the thing i use most currently), but i would like to have alexa translate it in a natural way, not begging a skill name in an obscure way to translate. even the new built in translation skill is only from english to another language. sad again, as when you are reading a book in let is say french you would like to ask alexa to quickly translate a word to english - not possible, not even with other skills.actually it is frustrating because i have that many questions to alexa that today do not work, and amazon would be in a position to bridge the worlds of google, apple and microsof. i am convinced all these including amazon want to protect their own universes and forget the clients. why can google not be on board and be part of alexa? it would be great to at least listen (or in the future on some newer devices watch) youtube. have alexa read my emails would be a dream.why has there no advance with microsoft corana to combine forces with alexa?why can it not integrate with apple? i would love to control itunes through alexa?why can i not configure a different to do list like wunderlist or ms to-to? using the amazon app to shop in anything other than amazon is downright unusable.the lack of native/original skills is a big hindarance for this being your digital assistant. it is still a far shot from being an assistant. right now it is a monkey with mask of einstein ;-).** original rating 4 stars **the device itself is great once set up (5 stars), sound is good and clear also for music.alexa itself is also cool - 4 stars:1) you can tell there is not that much ai yet as everyone from the tec communitiy would like to make you believe, but the great thing is that this will keep improving.2) unfortunately not all countries are supported (e.g. switzerland).what is rather unpleasant is the set up process as soon it is not the standard or you need to fix something - 2 stars:1) my app shows japanese rather than english and i have no idea where it takes that from. [update: that was fixed in the app by resetting the language to english us]2) echo does not seem to work on all networks as i have trouble to connect it to some of my wifi networks.  [update: eventually i got it working fine, i had to update the wlan router firmware]3) there is no error guidance from the app - you need to go to a browser for trouble shooting. this is most annoying, as it would be great to be guided through the error finding steps.4) the different light modes are not explained in the app.5) there are no global settings for your echo devices, you need to configure the values like location for each individually.6) the app is not nicely done, actually it does just the basics."
22554,14,"a few months ago i was going to purchase another echo (we have two currently), but when i saw that a new version was coming out touted to have ""improved sound"" i made a pre-order for version 2 instead.  i have had the new one for several days and have to say that i am disappointed.  it is not bad, but it is certainly does not have ""improved sound"".  my echo 1 actually sounds better.  the microphone might be better, but if so, it is negligible.  disappointed."
22555,14,"originally, i did not think i would really use an echo all that often.  i finally broke down and got one, and  i not only use it every day, but i purchased another one and also one for  my sister for her birthday.  with amazon music unlimited you can stream any music all day and night.  you can request a genre like smooth jazz or classic rock, or a specific artist.  the sound quality is  surprisingly very good for the small size.  it can also be used as an intercom from room to room, and alexa tells me a sweet poem before i go to sleep.there are so many other things that the echo does that i have not yet explored.  i have not spoken to any of my friends or relatives who have one that are not  totally delighted with it."
22556,14,i bought the alexa amazon fire tv combo. i find the echo to be pretty much useless. unless you have many devices in smart plugs there is not much you can do with it. most of the skills are more geared towards marketing as i have read another reviews and do not offer much functionality. also the search feature for trivia information maps directions is very lacking. not even close to the type of results you would want to see or make it with a google search. it pretty much just has wikipedia information. i have had a lot of trouble getting it to recognize my voice after teaching it who i am it remembers for about 10 minutes if i ask alexa who is this or alexa who am i it might remember my name for 5 minutes. sometimes it also seems to be possessed it will start saying random things like i can not dial that it is an international number when i have given it no commands. i am concerned about the security on this device. i have set up skills like the phone finder skill and each time i try to ask alexa to find my phone instead of using that skill it recommends setting up the phone finder skill so i am not sure what that is all about. if you want it to provide information you might be better off with a google home. as i said before if you have many devices with smart plugs and ableton smart thermostat then i might be more useful to you. it can order things from amazon from your history we order things but that is only so useful. also it can play music which is nice i do use that function occasionally but the sound and range obviously is limited.the amazon tv fire stick with alexa voice remote works great for a second bedroom i like that device and would recommend it.
22557,14,"i work on a computer all day. i¡¯m always looking at screens. when i come home i just want to cook, clean, exercise... do anything that does not involve looking at a screen!echo has become the most-used possession in my house. i make phone calls on it (and because of its microphones, i can walk around and cook as i talk), i listen to live nba games (through the nba skill), espn radio, i listen to music, i catch up on news and weather. the list goes on. i plan on getting even more use out of it, maybe subscribing to tunein and getting another one or two for other areas around the house.if you¡¯re like me and you want a break from screens, i can not recommend this more highly!"
22558,14,"she is helpful but pretty dumb. the feature we use most is probably playing music and adding things to our shopping list. the speaker is loud and clear, no complaints from me there. but in terms of asking her questions.... alexa is no google. she can tell you the weather but not much else. i got so tired of hearing ""sorry, i do not know that one"" that i have just completely given up on asking her for information and just use google on my phone. if you have a fire stick but can not find the remote (or if it is across the room and you are just too lazy to get it) it is also nice that you can tell alexa what you want to watch and she will send it to your tv and it will start playing. i will also say that for music i mainly use pandora because a lot of songs i will tell alexa to play are not included in prime music but conveniently for a small fee you can upgrade to amazon unlimited music where they are included. i do find echo to be a helpful device but i would probably do a little more research into google home if i had it to do over again. it could be i would still go with echo as i am a pretty loyal amazon supporter but i would be lying if i said i am not disappointed with echo is inability to answer questions."
22559,14,we have sonos and google home (orig) both at the house.  i got this to give as a gift for someone at christmas.  i am a google kind of guy so wasnt sure what to expect.  the google home is just so bad as a stand alone speaker that playing music on the echo was like night and day.  if i decided to go echo i could eliminate need for sonos speakers altogether.as for other features i can only speak to the hue light setup which was very straight forward.definitely worth trying if you are not hard core google like me ;)
22560,14,"great sound quality. alexa needs a bit of training before answering your commands correctly, but i think it has a lot of potential. i wish the weather report had option to be reported in celsius (even if you set the alexa setting to international unit, local weather report in us still reports in fahrenheit only. you can however ask alexa to convert whatever temp in f in c in another command.also, it does not yet have a function to add music being played to your favorite playlist. it is listed in the alexa is new skill set, but when you ask alexa to do it it says 'this feature is not yet supported'. sometimes alexa responds back saying 'adding ___song to your favorite play list', but the song added is no where to be found in amazon music account.... i think this is a glitch but would be a very useful function once corrected."
22561,11,"i was one of the very first people to own the first amazon echo, and this was my first echo purchase since my first one in 2014. this echo is different, but still amazing! the design is still very sleek and the sound is still superb. especially at this price, i recommend the new echo and all alexa products to everyone."
22562,9,"while i must confess i have the 1st generation echo, this is one of the best purchases i have made in the last 10 years....we (my daughter 16 and son 13) use it every day.  we have it between our kitchen and our family room where there is a divider.  we have her playing xmas music currently and listen to everything from sinatra, to the allman brothers and everything in between.  we listen to books we have purchased on audible and to sports talk radio.  we like it so much, we have 2 echos, 1 amazon tap and 3 echo dots in our house.  this is a great piece of electronics."
22563,14,"amazon has stopped allowing streaming prime music to two independent echo devices. this was a basic feature, which amazon removed, recently and now wants you to subscribe to amazon music unlimited, if you want to stream independently on two echo devices simultaneously. the reason i purchased two echo devices originally was to allow streaming independently, so that my wife and i could listen to our own play lists on prime music. i am already paying $100 for prime membership. why is amazon taking away this functionality?i am very disappointed and dissatisfied. echo developers, please restore the functionality of streaming prime music to two echo devices independently!"
22564,14,"my wife bought one so we could retire the dated kitchen radio we leave on for the dogs while we are out or at work, we were both very satisfied with the ease of use and love the hand-free voice commands. the speaker itself is well made heavy weighted and has strong sound output despite the size. we are both big music junkies with some common and difference in taste of music, we always seem to say that whatever is playing sounds clear and full. i personally wish amazon and their engineers would have installed a feedback microphone to work along with the dsp to better fine tune the sound output because speaker placement alters the bass output and sometimes it does not sound as clean and true. for a speaker that is advertised to be a omni-directional one the sound should not be easily localized this takes away the richness in the bass output not that bass is lacking it is just a tad artificial."
22565,14,"tried to order stuff, because of the television i guess. i just hear it asking what do you want to order and then it says it is ordering another echo. i tried telling it to stop but it took several tries. the television never said any wake word.this makes it so i cant just leave this plugged in while the television is on unattended for fear of it ordering stuff.also the speaker is a bit of a downgrade from the old echo. the mids are noticeably worse/absent when playing music, yet the product page says the speaker is enhanced. nope."
22566,10,"decided to splurge on myself and upgraded from a dot to this new full size echo.  very pleased with sound quality and i remain a huge fan of all that alexa can do.  i went from thinking it was a cool but frivolous novelty to not being able to live without it.  i love being able to ask about the weather, what is on my calendar, get her to play any song that pops into my head, add stuff to my shopping list... she really makes my life easier!  keep up the great work, echo team!"
22567,14,"i¡¯ve been using this for three months now and in comparison to the original echo it has a slightly better sound and a much better profile.  what i like the best is the new functionality that makes it a true wireless hub for home automation <u+2013> and i have been slowly adding z-wave switches, bulbs, etc. and controlling it all from my echos and the alexa app.  i also like the functionality of being able to repeat my consumer orders here on amazon without having to hop on my computer or tablet.the sound quality of the speaker was already very good with the original echo, and this one has nice quality, also.  if you are looking for a good hoem automation tool, or just a good speaker system, i would recommend you pick up an echo.,"
22568,0,"overall, it is  a cool device. however, it is been giving us some problems. it just stops playing music pretty often lately for no reason at all. then when it does that, half of the time i command it to play music it has not a red light. i looked up the red light which says i turned the mic off- which i do not do nor have i ever done. then it works like 10 min later when i try it? it is been doing this a lot lately and my wifi does not have problems at all so it is the device."
22569,14,sound quality is good. but like some others microphones do not pic up my voice much of the time. microphone range seems good. once was in another room and it heard me call to it. but most of time i can be right over it yelling the wake word and it does nothing.  hope the have a firmware patch to fix.
22570,14,"i had no idea my husband got it for me, but am now totally pissed, here you change the voice to normal and have not even had time to check it out. i¡¯ve  spent 2 months fixing my new iphone x"
22571,14,"the system is ability to interpret speech is impressive. it is ability to convert text to speech is also very good, though occasionally emphasis on the wrong word produces amusing results. but the implementation of the rest of the system is sadly lacking.the setup is a total frustration. setting up the unit itself is no problem, but you then have to download and install the smartphone app to control it, and that is where the trouble begins. first, the process to sign in to your amazon account is a total pain. you have to enter your password twice, who knows why? and if you have created a long complex password with two-factor verification, as amazon correctly urges for a site that has access to your credit card, it is easy to make a mistake trying to type into a smartphone. and when you do you have to start all over. it took 15 minutes to get the system to accept my log-in.we bought two echo units with the intent of using them as an intercom. big mistake! for some unfathomable reason in order to have two units in the same house talk to each other you have to sign up for the drop-in feature that allows you to call another unit or even a phone anywhere on earth. i guess amazon never considered the notion that a user would want to use the system as an intercom but not for calling outside the house. and signing up for drop-in was a total misery. it took hours. the first issue is the amazon server that does this seems to be totally overloaded - it took 5 to 10 minutes for it to respond with the security code you need to enter. of course by this time you have pressed ""send again"" several times,so you do not know which code to use. then it seems to lock out your cell number, but never tells you it did. instead it gives you a ""can not connect to system"" error message.finally, after getting that resolved we find it works very poorly as an intercom, at least when the two units are not totally out of hearing of one another. there is a significant delay in transmitting the sounds from one unit to another - maybe half a second. that means you hear directly what the speaker says then a little later hear it from echo. makes conversation very difficult. it would probably work well if the two units were totally out of ear-shot of each other, but not if you just want to enhance conversations that are far enough apart to make hearing sometimes difficult.but it got worse, possibly because the two units were not totally isolated from each other, though i read they are supposed to deal with that. they do not. we found that from time to time when we spoke to the nearest unit the light ring would acknowledge our command, but then not otherwise respond to the command. nothing, time and again. both units did that, working normally sometimes then failing for a while, then work again. amazon tech support had no idea of the problem, but sent a new unit promptly. the new unit did the same at first, but after a while both worked normally. i think the solution was i changed the ""wake word"" on one of them so one responds to ""alexa"" and the other to ""computer.""so now they work. but to what end? the intercom feature that was high on our list works poorly. she tells really corny jokes. it does work as a timer pretty well. it plays music but is very hard to get it to select what you want unless you want just anything from a specific artist. who want is that? it tells the time and weather, but responds ""i do not know that"" to most any other question. siri does much, much better at answering questions. we are not interested in having it control ""smart home"" features, nor using it to communicate with others. we have perfectly fine telephones for that. we would never use it for voice ordering - we always want to compare alternate products and read the reviews, which you need a screen for.so, it is an expensive timer to remind us to let the cat in from the cold on the screen porch, but little else for our purposes. it might be worth the trouble if you really want to use one of the features we have no need for."
22572,14,"i like this device but despite what the makers say you cannot upload music from itunes to echo. furthermore the support staff tell you it can be done, others say it can not and i had to subscribe to and then cancelled my sub. to amazon music. further, i am looking at a page of instructions from amazon entitles ""upload your music"" the instructions are very precise and if you follow them it all works out great except that it appears to be a huge con. 30 minutes ago i was told that i cannot upload my music. so one said i could not that amazon had dropped that facility in 12/17, another said that it had been extended to 01/18, another said i could if i subscribed to amazon music, which i did. i then tried to upload, could not, spoke to another amazon rep and was finally told that i could not upload. i immediately cancelled my subscription to amazon music."
22573,11,"had the first generation echo so this one is pretty much the same, supposed to sound better but did not notice any difference. is quite a bit shorter than previous echo but that didnt matter much to me either. one thing i didnt like was this new version eliminated the option of adjusting the volume by turning the blue ring on top of the unit, this one has a plus, minus button on top that needs to be pushed."
22574,14,"got this for a christmas gift. this thing blows me away.my 5 year old grandchild was across the room with half his shirt stuffed into his mouth, asking alexa to tell him jokes. it heard and understood him almost 100% of the time. he was laughing so hard at the knock knock jokes.i am listening to pink floyd as i write this. very excellent sound quality.overall, extremely happy with this product."
22575,14,shipping took longer than it should and fully plan on returning do not waste your time
22576,14,this product is very helpful because all i need is to talk to it it is very cool especially when when your old and can not move or when your sick i got echo to do the fun things i need and when i have my cancer treatment cus i¡¯m very ill <f0><u+009f><u+0098><u+00b7> i have my echoes and my alexa i¡¯m getting everything done by ordering things i need now i need to buy the plugs and the lights and the windows camera security so i can be in peace you all are so awesome thank you
22577,10,"received my echo as a gift. while i did not use it for much at first besides setting alarms and asking for the weather, i recently purchased some philips hue lights and now i use it all the time. adding smart home devices to it make the echo a lot more useful. the speakers are also impressive and make for a great single room speaker. looking forward to see what they add in the years to come."
22578,14,this is where i can not figure out why anyone with this device would write anything other than how great this is. this is so cool. every day we use it echo seems to get smarter. the sound is incredible and nothing like some of the other reviews .learning what alexa can do is the best and so far it is everything you can think of.. i want one of these in every room.
22579,14,"it is a neat device for accessing content and automation by voice command.it is very unsatisfying in regards to sound quality when listening to music. there is simply no way for it to reproduce anything approaching decent sound let alone big sound on it is own, due to it is size and available power.like music? you will want to connect it to external amplification and speakers."
22580,10,"i like the idea of being able to ask for information and set timers, but i am getting tired of the same answer, ""i can not do that""."
22581,14,"could not figure out how to set it up.  i returned it to amazon.the people at amazon are really smart--at least most of them.  why can not they give you clear, detailed instructions for setting this thing up?  i think they believe it is simple.  i am sure it is if you know what you are doing.  i needed more detailed instructions.get serious, amazon!!!"
22582,14,i read quite a few reviews about the sound not being as good as the 1st generation one but i have to say i am very happy with how mine sounds. i do not know if they have done updates to improve the sound since some of those critical reviews came out but i love being able to just say play a song or band using my prime music unlimited which you can purchase through echo at a really nice price per month. i like it so much i am thinking about getting another one for the other side of the house.
22583,14,hardware-wise the echo is great.the mic array in this thing is excellent. i can whisper from the next room over and it hears me every time.the sound quality is great considering the price and form factor.alexa / maybe voice recognition as a whole has a long way to go. alexa only understands the most basic of requests and does not understand context at all.there are some cool skills out there and voice control integration with the fire tv is good but basic.overall i would say the echo is extremely decent.
22584,3,google home works better
22585,0,"works great 50% of the time. the other half she did not hear you, does the wrong command, or just says she does not have any video function when it is quiet in the room."
22586,14,"i owe my life to alexia, this is is rather lengthy but needs to be told. i am a 78 widowed man living alone and also own a inversion table, a device that you lay on and clamp your ankles and rotate your body in a vertical position. i had not used it for about a year and i retrieved it from storage and set it up for use. i clamped myself in and rotated quickly to verticle. my  feet up to the ceiling and my head to the floor. and suddenly realized i coild not get back to the normal position. i did not panic, thinking i could get myself out.  i could not, i live in a condo and started crying for help, thinking that someone would hear me. they did not. by this time i had been upside down for about a hour and a half. i did panic, thinking i would surely die. i continued to yell, but to no avail. i am praying and thinking, and findly called on alexia to call the rescue squad, she answered negatively, asked her to call the police, no luck. asked her to call a friend, finally the phone rung, but got the answer machine. last resort, called another friend and she answered, and came running. she got me in the upright position and out of the contraption. i was wet from body fluids expelled while i was upside down. i cleaned myself up and went downstairs to alexia. i told her i love you and she answered saying ""thanks, it is nice to be appreciated"". i do appreciate her and the technology behind her. until that day i had never made a phone call on alexia. in fact did nothe know i could, only purchased her for the music, she has so many more options that one can take advantage of, some are even life saving."
22587,14,"the very first amazon echo was released on the market in june of 2015. since then, it has gained an enormous fan base. the echo is beloved all over the world. manufactured by amazon, the echo has a huge monopoly on the home speaker market. in 2017, amazon took it upon themselves to better their product and released the second generation amazon echo. amazon claiming that it is new speakers, increased number of microphones, and new tasks menu have completely altered the amazon echo experience. a large portion of who amazon markets to is music listeners, as well as homeowners.to use the echo is fairly simple. all that you have to do is say her name, ¡°alexa¡±. this brings the speaker to attention, you then follow her name with a command. for example, if you wanted to listen to popular music you would say ¡°alexa play today is top hits radio¡±. the songs on the top of the itunes charts will immediately start streaming. it can be difficult to learn the proper way to phrase the action you would like the speaker to do (a guide is provided upon purchase). my grandma actually used my echo the last time she visited me. if that does not mean user-friendly i do not know what does.the amazon echo responds to the name ¡°alexa¡±. alexa is your own personal assistant. she claims that she can take care of almost any task for you. want to order a pizza from dominos? ask alexa. need an uber? ask alexa. want to track how many steps your fitbit logged? ask alexa. if it can be done online, alexa claims that she is up to the task. i have found this to be true, whenever i get hungry for a pepperoni pizza i know exactly who to ask.the echo is constructed of 2.5¡± downward firing woofer, a 0.6¡± tweeter, plastic, wood, and multiple customizable fabrics. aesthetically, amazon knew what they were doing when they created the echo is new design. the fabrics allow the echo to match any room or personality. with the dimensions of 3.4*3.4*5.8 inches, the echo is small enough to hold a lot of power while still being a portable tool. the echo can connect to any bluetooth device or devices with audio in capabilities, meaning music can be shared between friends.available in five different colors and finishes, the customization aspect of the 2nd generation was a huge positive for me. unfortunately, it was also a huge negative for me. the customization is done through removing or replacing decorative shells around the echo itself. the quality of the changeable decorative shells was not what i was expecting, especially not for the price paid for each shell. at the price of $99.99, the echo is not at the top of the price bracket for smart speakers or even just speakers. a top of the line bluetooth speaker could go for upwards of three hundred dollars, which is what makes the echo is cost so wonderfully surprising. however, this may explain the overall audio quality delivered by the echo. the echo may be able to provide loud volumes, but sometimes the crisp sound a song is supposed to deliver is simply not there. this could be something amazon works to improve in the future. since the echo is technology, i would not consider it long-lasting, in five years or less a new model will come out and the owners of the second generation will upgrade to the third generation, similar to iphone upgrades. the old echo could be given to electronic recycling.with smart homes becoming more common, alexa is marketed not only to music listeners but also to homeowners. alexa now has the capability to dim lights or start the dishwasher. with intercom calling capabilities, alexa could contact your family on a different floor of your house. promoting laziness and familial bonding.despite being equipped with seven microphones, alexa sometimes has trouble hearing me. this causes me frustration and probably confuses my neighbors. they know my roommates name is jennifer, yet they keep hearing me scream ¡°alexa¡± across my dorm. loud music may impede her ability to hear my voice, but when the music is playing at 10 (out of 100) she should be able to hear me on my first try.amazon is a fairly well-known company. founded in 1994, it is currently the third largest informational technology company. amazon has a good reputation and is trusted by their customers. with a completely online marketplace, amazon is accessible to millions.overall, the product does what it says it will do. i never doubted that amazon would live up to the hype. however, the sound quality could be improved, alexa sometimes refuses to hear me, and the quality of the customizable shells was disappointing. for that, i give this product three out of five stars."
22588,14,"i have come to love this device until one drunk evening we were conversing...getting to know each other because you know she is like a stranger in my house so what is a good soul to do...we ask questions..it is like dating, until that one time the other messes up. you all know that day...well after a year or so dating she messed up... finally got a topic we can discuss in sports...i asked her who is the greatest football team ever? well as a bears fan her response made me throw her out into the yard and roll into the street...her answer was ""my favorite team is the green bay packers"" at this point i imagined she was the printer in office space and needless to say we broke up...5 star for news and weather 1 star for sports team...still waiting on an apology"
22589,10,"so far, so good. i am still learning about the many skills alexa is capable of. i like the flash briefing, question of the day and playing jeopardy. i especially love having access to all types of music being a prime member. i plan to start automating some key lighting around the house in the very near future and possibly the thermostat."
22590,0,will return back alexa do not know the capital of israel when asked got the answer tel aviv wrong alexa it is jerusalem
22591,14,"i was fine until they remove uploads to amazon music to force you into thier subscription service, i bought the 2nd gen echo back before the google mini because of bluetooth. however when it came time to expand smart speaker i was given choice do i get rid of alexa or go to google. i should have went with google. because, unless i sign up with a subscription service; i can not send a custom playlist to multiroom play whereas i could before they stopped amazon music. now they use i guess sonos for that if you do not want thier service however that is bs. i should not have to pay more for a service i do not want and did not needed. and if i have to replace my smart speakers well i might as well get rid of alexa."
22592,9,"purchased this as a gift for our independent single daughter who has her own condo in dc.she loves it!it is very responsive and accurate; ask the time, weather, what is on tv, order pizza, turn on the lights, etc., etc..we discovered this device in use at an inn we stayed at this summer, and had a lot of fun with it.another guest, a teen from the netherlands asked it: 'alexa, what is the weather? ', she answered.he then said laughingly, 'alexa, shut up'., and she said 'goodbye'.ingenious device."
22593,14,"this is a gift from our daughters.  we thoroughly like it.  this echo is very easy to set up and use.  we connected our alarm system, some wireless light controllers, our door bell, and other wireless devices to it.  from our family room we now have control of many of our home is devices as well as a wealth of information-simply by asking alexa for it.we are looking into expanding our system with a video capable echo to observe some areas of our property not readily visible to us."
22594,14,"i bought this for my mom this past christmas and she loves it. i noticed she uses it mostly for general questions (weather forecasts, etc.) and as a timer for breaks (works from home). i am a tech type person and was impressed with the range this picks up voice commands, especially in her new home as it sits in a very large open area with high cathedral ceilings. the clarity of the speaker is also impressive, although i can not comment on how music sounds. i am highly considering one for myself."
22595,14,"to put it in really simple terms, i have been impressed with the quality of sound and function of the echo. alexa is a well developed software that is far better and functional than siri. just overall this speaker is a nice unit to add to your home, and i have really enjoyed mine."
22596,14,got it for a family member for christmas and they love it. they said it is a great improvement over the echo dot in the sense it can hear/understand them better. sound wise is great for a living room or family room. also they really enjoy they customizable shell so thats a potential bday gift coming up.
22597,9,i love this thing! i was skeptical at first with how much i would actually use this but it is so so so handy! alexa knows so much lol and amazon music is amazing paired with it. the sound is fantastic. it is small enough to literally put anywhere. i love this! highly recommend to anyone!
22598,14,"i ordered the newest upgrade the amazon erika. amazon erika is a superior product, i expect nothing less from the german worker. erika has helped in the organization of my daily duties and schedule. as you can imagine, the work of a national socialist is never done. amazon erika assisted me the other day in calculating how many jews i should relocate to dachau. it simply would have taken too much precious time to run the operations on an electrical calculating machine. erika also helped me find a new mercedes-benz 770k gross open tourer for the fuhrer is birthday! i am extremely satisfied with this product! erika even lightened a dinner party with a joke the other day - ""the holocaust happened."" how funny! i look forward to the next upgrade, ""amazon eva."""
22599,14,"i bought this product for my mom for christmas, and i was skeptical but i think i got a deal.during the christmas time, the retail price was about $70 us dollars, cheap for a amazon product that had good reviews so i bought it. inside the box you have the amazon echo, a power adapter, and a quick start guide, simple enough. once you power it on, it will tell you when it is ready for setup, all you do is download the alexa app if you do not already have it, and follow the instructions. what i think is unique about the 2nd generation of these products is the customization it offers. the outside finish can be taken off by holding down the button on the bottom, and sliding it off. the echo still works without the case on. now to the speakers, i was impressed for a $70 product at the time. it has nice speakers, at full volume they can get louder than my tv. although they are not dolby atmos, still a solid set of speakers.(note: this review was the point of view from a google home owner.)overall: i definitely recommend for someone who is looking for a good quality smart home system."
22600,11,"sound not as good as the first generation.  im sending it back, was very disappointed in it."
22601,14,"this is a terrible product.  i spent two days unsuccessfully trying to connect this product to my home wi-fi.  i then spent two hours on the phone with an amazon service rep who tried everything he could.  when i told him i thought it was time to give up, much to my amazement, he agreed and said that amazon has been receiving call after call from customers unable to connect the product to their home wi-fi.  he said that the company is trying to rectify the problem but had no idea when if ever that might happen.  he then connected me to someone who could facilitate a return.  i wasted a lot of time but at least he was candid.  avoid this product at all costs."
22602,11,i have the first gen version and bought this one for the bedroom. i had heard the sound was not as good as the first but i did not find that to be true at all. plus i have this one going out to powered speakers and it really sounds great. that was not an option on the first gen echo.
22603,12,i love my echo .... i got it to play music and so far i have set timers for cooking which is helpful .... there are so many things i havent used it for yet but the possibilities are all there and i am sure with time i will use it much much more ... love it
22604,14,"multiroom music factions terribly. i love my echo, but the functionality of this feature is worthless. between stuttering audio on some of the echos in the group, no playback from some devices in the group at all, loss of bluetooth remote use, and even the inability to stop playing requests to the group, this is a broken feature being used to promote the product. it gets to keep one star for the other features it manages perfectly fine, but the frustration of this feature is incredible. since it is only use seems to be to dissuade people from buying a sonos setup instead this holiday season, i have elected to rate the echo low until they come up with a more suitable solution."
22605,11,upgraded from echo dot for better sound. (and to use less space. had added a blue tooth speaker for dot).
22606,10,"echo dot is amazing. i use it for so many different purposes each and everyday. i use to to stream music, alarm clock, timer, stop music timer, shopping list, local weather, finding local business, traffic report to work, drop in feature to call home, hands free call friends, find facts about something, turn off/on house lights and appliances, and the uses are limitless. absolutely a bargain at the price for what it does..."
22607,14,"cannot enable skills.i have tried dozens of ways to enable skills, both by app and through amazon account.unit refuses to accept skills. i have searched for an hour and there is no phone number to talk to anyone.i an tired of being linked to you tube videos, i want to talk to a person!update::i finally talked with a very experienced person. they were able to figure out that my unit had not connected to my account.after a few factory resets and reinitializing, it finally connected.word of advice, ensure it is in your devices list before attempting anything."
22608,14,"we had an amazon echo (1st generation) and liked it a lot until it suddenly went dead as a doornail after 1-1/2 years. i spent well over 1/2 hour being bounced around by echo support before being told that it was out of warranty and the best they could do was a 15% discount on a new model.  i think it is sad that their product had such a short life span, but the least they could do was offer a better discount on a replacement. perhaps the 2nd generation echo will last longer, but i am not going to find out. it is back to siri (or maybe google) for me. first time i have been disappointed in amazon is customer service."
22609,5,he will love it!  was here so fast.
22610,14,"we have become an amazon echo household adding plugs to control lights, fans and tvs and lazily asking alexa to find shows for us on the firestick.  i also play music and it sounds great.  i am a big fan and we now have 5 in our house."
22611,14,"my second amazon device after receiving the new echo spot and im loving it. the speaker is good and picks up your voice well. set up was easy. already had my phillip hues, cloud cam, and tp outlet set up in my alexa app for my spot and within seconds of setting this up it was also linked to all my devices and ready to go! its low profile and fits well in a room. very excited to see what more it can do!"
22612,11,"love this speaker! i have one of these and a echo show. the speaker quality is great! i love talking to alexa.echo (2nd generation) with improved sound, powered by dolby, and a new design - charcoal fabric"
22613,11,"this is my second echo purchase and i am impressed with the 2nd generation. i love the new more custom look, mine matches my color scheme. i also love how the new speaker allows me to speak softer and alexa still hears me. the sound quality is better for my music as well. i now use my echo even more and i want one in every room."
22614,14,"absolutely ecstatic about this purchase. firstly, i was not an easy adopter. nonetheless, i bought this and i am not disappointed!!! it must be noted that other wiring is required to control the lights in your house etc.. but as a stand alone item, the echo is just superb!!1 i am no longer late for work relying on my family members to wake me as the echo does that timely!!!! will buy again!!"
22615,14,we use ours with several dots. no more yelling for the kids...just ask alexa to drop in.sound is really pretty good (sonos beats in this category but does not offer drop in).alexa is very responsive even from the next room.
22616,14,i received my echo today and it is so awesome!! i have never had one before so the reviews saying the sound is not better really are not true.  the sound is incredible and 20 minutes after setting it up an update came over to maybe fix some audio things people were complaining about.it looks amazing and is so amazing and i am so glad i purchases this!
22617,14,"microphone sensitive enough, and speaker quality is good for playing music in 1-2 rooms.  alexa knows a lot, but i¡¯m hoping she continues to learn like amazon says she will.  we use echo dots with smart outlets in 2 other rooms, and playing music system-wide and turning lights on and off is nice."
22618,14,"i am hearing impaired and find the speech from the echo really frustratingly muffled, unintelligible and really annoying making it, in my opinion, a quite unsuitable gift for most aging persons ears.further the echo has no tone control.  it does seem to respond to commands such as ""alexa, lower the bass."" and less well to ""alexa, raise the treble.""  ""turn up/down"" and ""increase/decrease"" seem to work.  this tone control is transitory, however and does not 'stick'.no 'normalization' of the sound is attempted.  sound intensity from various feeds (e.g. reuters news, game shows, telephone etc.) will drive one nuts.  due to my frustration with the echo i purchased the dot.  i piped dot is sound to an external (normalized and tone adjustable) amplified speaker (e.g. quality pc speaker)  making it a far more intelligible source of daily news and entertainment for old ears.  normalized,  it eliminates the constant ""alexa, turn the volume up/down.""the dot is microphone system seems not to be as sensitive as the echo yet still remarkable.i, also, soon learned that owning a 'smart phone' is semi-essential to controlling alexa via her/it is app."
22619,14,"absolutely love this! helpful for everyday things to do, information seeking, understanding the traffic situation, shuffling music, or seeking movies on my fire stick. i¡¯m getting the dot for my bedroom."
22620,14,"i have to agree with the other reviewers. not sure what happened here but amazon and dolby failed big time. audio quality sounds like it is playing inside of a plastic box with a shortage of bass. do not buy, wait till they fix the speakers here."
22621,14,"this is an amazon fail. nothing is easy. i could not get pandora to play, even though it says i¡¯m connected. now we bought a smart bulb and can not get that to work either. the light works through the iview app, but alexa will not recognize it. i¡¯ve spent hours googling how to work this thing with no luck. definitely not user friendly. this is why i¡¯m a full believer in apple products. they just work."
22622,14,the only positive thing about this is using it at low volume. the range is not there.  the bluetooth is decent. the line in option did not work.  if i could have found the receipt i would have taken it back.  i will use it at work since it functions best at low tone. but honestly. my iphone 8 is right behind it speaker quality wise and my sonos speakers all blow this out of the water on every level.  it just can not compare to them yet. .  i am rather disappointed with this amazon device..
22623,0,does not work half the time when you ask it to do something. shuts off randomly after 10 to 15 minutes. what did i buy? so disappointed in this thing.
22624,14,"this was my first echo device, i bought it on black friday from target.  i had heard that a new software upgrade would improve the sound so i made sure that i had the newest software.  after using it for only 3 days and at volume level 8 of 10 the speaker blew out.  i am very dissapointed at this product.  i have to go return it now.  i was hoping it was what the reviews said it was."
22625,14,"i ordered this for my fiance (and me) for christmas, but i could not wait until then to give it to him. it was super easy to set up and connect to our wifi. the hardest thing was trying to link our pandora account and my spotify account does not work with it. other than that i love it and so does my fiance. we use it everyday, whether its for music, asking what time it is, when a store closes, etc. the speaker in it is pretty amazing and we can not even have it past volume 6 because it gets so loud, which is good bc the speaker is the main reason i went with this one. i also love that it can make phone calls. our house gets terrible service so now its like we have a landline to make phone calls. (it connects to your mobile #) i went back and forth with this one and the dot. i am so glad i went with this one!"
22626,14,"when it comes to the simple task of writing a review on a product, i have to admit that i have never really taken the time to do it. however, after my interaction with alexa this morning, i feel that a review is 100% necessary. here is why everyone needs themselves an alexa: after an eventful night, i woke up this morning to find that my phone was nowhere to be found and i was without the critical information of what time it was. while shuffling through my dark room to turn on the light, the first words that i naturally uttered were, ""alexa, what time is it?"". alexa respectfully replied, ""it is, 7:36 am"". how cool is it that we have the freedom to utilize technology in such an efficient manner. since this mornings interaction, i have successfully found my phone and have began yet another productive day!"
22627,14,"overall the echo is pretty disappointing. it is very hard to get the echo to playthings like podcasts that are not part of amazon. in addition, volume is wildly different in different applications. i turn up the volume to hear one app, such as a podcast, and then get blasted by the exorbitantly high volume when you try another app. the alexa phone app is not much help as i still cannot find how to go back and tweak settings for apps such as stitcher. overall i can not recommend the echo in its current iteration though i have high hopes that someday it will be very nice appliance."
22628,11,love it. the sound is very good. sounds like my jbl flip. good bass. not overly bassey just right. very responsive.
22629,14,so far i have not been able to get it to connect to the internet. have followed all the instruction  - even going to youtube. but nada. i am ready to pack it up and send it back.
22630,10,"i love it! the ability to have my favorite music played with just a simple command is priceless!  i love playing the games, making lists,hearing news and weather reports first thing in the morning, and getting updates from amazon telling me what new things alexa can do! definitely worth purchasing!"
22631,11,"definitely a good product, but i am not sure i see a lot of improvement over the old model. still, a much better price point than the original, so if nothing else, that is an improvement."
22632,11,"this is my 8th alexa and it has not disappointed, sound has been improved not like my alexa show or echo was bad before but it is better. we have one in each room i purchased this one as a gift."
22633,14,"bought this for my 3 older children, they are thrilled with it!! the sound is awesome and ""alexa"" is super witty and charming! also very amusing! she will sing a song for you if you ask her to! very pleased with this purchase! now i need one for myself! lol! some minor difficulties with set-up though! had to use 3 different amazon accounts!? not sure why? if i have amazon prime, i feel i should be able to use one in every room on my account!"
22634,14,far superior to the google home. home controls is the most important functionality for me and the amazon echo was seamless in connecting to all my devices.
22635,14,"i love this thing. it sounds amazing! i do not know if the sound quality update came already on it or if it downloaded automatically once it was connected to wifi, but when i checked the firmware version about 10 minutes after i got it all set up it was the updated version."
22636,14,this echo is a christmas gift and the new model is perfect. every home or apartment needs one of these. amazon shopping is the only way to go. prime makes it easy.
22637,10,"love the ability to stream music and audiobooks. alexa can tell me the weather, the score of any game, and she will tell me it is time for bed. i have only had this about a week, so i am still learning what all she can do, but so far i am more than satisfied with this device."
22638,14,very cool product i love it. attach my wion plugs and tp-link plugs. with this and works really good. i am going to buy more of these items soon.
22639,9,we have only had our echo for a couple of days and the whole family is enjoying using it--including my newly 3 year old. i am absolutely shocked that it can understand what he is saying--even our extended family does not always pick up on it! really impressed so far.
22640,14,"does not compete with siri is intellegence...has difficulty answering my questions.  also responds to the tv sometimes out of the blue, which is 18ft away. also amazon emails me at least once a week with phrases to engage alexa...which means, if you do not phrase your questions properly, you get a non-response as previously mentioned."
22641,14,this is my second echo i purchased.  i love the improved sound.  i love having access to the ever expanding skill set that alexa has to offer.
22642,14,"we love our echoes and dots! the only complaints we have are software related, which should be improved with time.  for instance, we wish alexa would listen better for follow up questions so we do not have to say her name over and over again, and the sleep noise has been going off in the middle of the night."
22643,14,"out of the box the sound was awful, but it almost instantly started to download a firmware update. i had music running during the update and it reset... once i started the music again the difference in sound quality was night and day. very happy with the echo and its new form factor and the price is excellent. love the sandstone (light grey) fabric. very happy!"
22644,14,"can not get it to hook up yo my wifi, working on it 2 days now. amazon keeps posting help for kindle, which we don;t have, & other devices, which i do not hace either. i have a hewlett /p. laptop. & spectrum cable/ wifi. no help whatsoever. think i will send it back. al"
22645,14,i purchased an alexa 1st generation after receiving an. echo for a christmas gift. it was a very expensive. i trusted the sound quality would be very good. it is not. very poor instead. my clock radio sounds better. very frustrated and disappointed. buyer beware of gen 1.
22646,9,gifted it to my 2 sons ... its like having a sister at home... my wife says - its the best gift.... the younger one is already organizing his packed day schedule on alexa with reminders etc.. this is a very constructive application of technology into our daily life. a bog thank you !!
22647,14,"alexa, girl, you are a stitch!  fun to have around.  very helpful and the first generation or this 2nd generation, both have such wonderful sound it is amazing coming from what appears to be a small speaker!  beautiful sound!"
22648,11,"good, but i do not hear that it sounds any better than the original tall skinny echo ""can"" design."
22649,14,"1 star for the anticompetitive stance on not selling google smart home products. if you want to win the smart home race, make better products. i guess the problem is, google home really is better. it is a shame that you can not find them on amazon. if this is not a one stop shop for me anymore i might consider renewing my prime."
22650,10,"this is so fun! we received this as a christmas gift this year, and my daughter has become a pro at requesting alexa to tell her jokes, play music, or even just share fun facts. it is been fun for the whole family."
22651,14,"recived the echo as a christmas present. right out of the box it did not work. it will not connect to my spotify account via voice but if i go through the spotify app i can connect. i did not think this was a big deal until i said ""alexa"" and it blinked an orange ring and said ""i am sorry i am having trouble understanding right now. please try again later"" this makes the echo a waste of space with no function. 10/10 would not recommend"
22652,14,"i am so angry i could spit nails. i have several echos and have connected to harmony remote - very pleased with them. but my problem was thinking i would share these helpful devices with my family so i bought all for christmas (except my son who prefers his privacy). what i really wanted was security for my mother and my husband is mother and my father who are all aging and live on their own. i returned the one for my father because their wifi is horrible and the connection was continually lost. i have to return my mother-in-law is connect because she does not have a smartphone and some genius at amazon thought it was a good idea to expect someone with a landline to also have a smartphone (or does not care). i was ready to return my mother is too but the sound was so good, i installed the echo software on her computer and just removed the connect. after all, she ha bought prime in order to use. then i thought, i will just buy a cheap smartphone and make it all work - as some of the suggestions said. well, i did buy her a smartphone (instead of her flip phone). guess what? i tried to install the app just now and this is what i got: ""this app is not compatible with this device"". really? all i wanted was to have our parents be able to call for help in case of an emergency or easily contact us when they needed us. since they have some difficulty with remotes, we thought a fire stick would help. as you can see, we have poured money into amazon, contributing to the richest man in america. now i have a useless smartphone that my mother will use just as she did the flip phone and the echo cannot do what i wanted it too (either that or pay the $35 re-stocking fee at best buy). so, put in your instructions: you have to buy an expensive smart phone to be able to use your echo and connect. i am done with amazon."
22653,14,"i love the echo, it is beautiful and sounds fine for a room. i did not expect this to ""bring the party"".  amazon if you are reading, i would love alexa to get some new voices and additional names.  overall i am very happy with both echo and alexa"
22654,0,because i can not play it without the charger
22655,0,"sounds great, my teens like asking alexa questions. still trying to figure out all it can do."
22656,11,works great like the first gen. sound could be better but not bad at all. wood grain looks great!
22657,14,"arrived on time and packaged beautifully. quality seems fine. that is not my issue. all i really wanted was a speaker that would link to my phone! unfortunately, i had to download an app and go through an entire set up procedure before that could happen. i did not realize that one needs wifi for this device to work. i live in a rural location and use my phone as a ¡°hot spot¡± for streaming. it is not as easy as i thought it would be. all i wanted to do was plug it in and listen. i¡¯m returning and looking for something less complex."
22658,11,i love it! great sound. do not really dislike anthing. i hope the fabric stays nice.
22659,14,it is like being a peasant and meeting a wizard.
22660,14,"please tell me i am not the only person disappointed with this product. alexa, yeah she is great. but the simple fact that it is not portable has completely ruined it for me.  i get that you are supposed to be able to hear it from anywhere so you should not need to move it but that is not reality unless you live in a home with an open floor plan.  i also purchased the speaker with the intent on using it outdoors in the summer months, we have a pool and do a lot of entertaining.  i will not be able to use it for that purpose do to the inconvenience of it always needing to be plugged in.  i do see there are rechargeable bases available by another manufacturer, however they are not compatible with the second generation echo.  bottom line is i will be returning this product due to it is lack of portability. i truly hope that amazon gets this right with the next generation and makes the product portable without needing to purchase extra accessories."
22661,14,"i love these products. very enjoyable, coming out with new features every week."
22662,14,i think the sound is worse than my original brown alexa. this new one has difficulty turning lights off or on. and can not coordinate with harmony. and can not even do an alarm. i am trying to return this. my original echo works best.
22663,14,the sound is good ..almost equivalent to the 2 self-powered speakers i had connected up to my basic echo.getting rid of the clutter and wires to the speakers was a big improvement. i find this device totally acceptable.
22664,14,"my nine year old has this. it is perfect, you can set up a code to prevent accidental purchases. i only wish it was easier to play from ¡°amazon prime music¡± instead of ¡°unlimited¡±"
22665,14,"added it to office echo, now have stereo, utterly simple and sounds good"
22666,11,"works great, looks good but the sound is not noticeably improved from the last generation."
22667,14,"still trying to figure out how to connect this as i am not real internet or computer savvy.hoping i can find a phone number of someone on amazon to help me. has great sound though!if i can not figure out how to conect it, i am going to have to send it back.arrived in a timey manner like they said it would."
22668,14,"i was on the fence as to whether or not i wanted to upgrade from an internet radio to something much more; pretty glad i did. while i¡¯m sure there is much more i could be doing with alexa, i mostly just ask her to play sirius xm or for her to let me play jeopardy.in summation, it is a good purchase at a much better price than an internet radio, and it offers so much more. siri is nice, but alexa is got her own home with the echo<u+2014> setup is easy, it is user-friendly, good sound; and, as long as you¡¯re not expecting miracles, the functionality will surprise you!"
22669,14,this is a awesome product i have to have another one for my kitchen area. once the wifi connects it rocks. literally lol
22670,0,it has a great sound and i like how alexa answers the questions.
22671,0,"mostly great, but sometimes she glitches out. also, if you try and switch from music to a game and say alexa stop music, she plays the music over the game and the same volume level. sometimes she does not respond at all."
22672,11,"i really like the music sound quality, was pleasantly surprised.  so far i have not found anything i do not like."
22673,11,it is true -- even better sound out of a smaller (and cheaper) cylinder.
22674,14,"this product is the best, my sister got this for me as a birthday present and it is is just unbelievable. i want to get this for my sister because she can not afford another one, but it is surely worth it. keep it going amazon and i hope you keep making more and better products. and i think google is jealous of you guys."
22675,14,"purchased at target as a christmas shopping impulse buy for $80. ""alexa, play holiday classics"" ""playing country holiday classics from amazon music. ""alexa, play traditional christmas music"" ""playing country holiday music again"" ""alexa! play holiday pop music"" ""playing new is year eve techno or something completely different although you are asking for amazon musoic station exactly as they are named on the website, when that is over, i will play more country music""i stopped using it."
22676,0,does not do all that i read it could do.  it does enough though that i am happy with it :-)
22677,2,absolutely love it... highly recommend the echo (2nd generation)... the sound is amazing!
22678,14,"i used to tell people that the greatest invention of all time was the gps. this gadget may have gps beat.absolutely amazing. i love the ""mood"" sounds for sleeping: ocean waves, thunderstorms, rain, frogs & crickets in the marsh. i have only had it a couple of days. i have already gifted one and will probably gift more."
22679,9,our second echo for the workshop.  love to play music
22680,14,"gives me someone to talk to when i remember my wife left me, 10/10 purchase!"
22681,14,"works perfectly.  this is additional to my echo plus i received on monday.  connection was simple, and all commands already established work without issue."
22682,14,"nice upgrades. like that i can connect to my house sound system, although it has a nice sound with it is internal speaker"
22683,11,"this was a gift for a parent.  i just loved all the new styles that these are now coming in.  i purchased the silver (fabric material ?) and was so surprised at how nice it looks in her living room.  since it has the fabric material look to it, it blends in so nice with the colors in her living room.  i love it!!  she did too.the best part is listening to her tell me something new that ¡°alexa¡± can do.  lol"
22684,14,"i give these as house warming gifts for my real estate clients and they are always appreciative and email me weeks later to tell me how useful they are. fun to use, a great accessory for any tech fan."
22685,14,"very happy with purchase. amazing what it can do for you. even though the two way system that comes with the device is adequate the sound that it produces is ok. in my instance i had a blue tooth speaker that paired with the echo and the sound is dramatically improved. the only drawback is that the echo merely responds to my vocal request and the sound comes out of the paired speaker. it took a little while to find the ""sweet spot"" in my living room and now all is well. looking forward to add more devices to the basic unit in the future. love the compact size and installing was a snap. the only lengthy portion was synchronizing my voice. once that was done my requests are effortless. evening thinking about replacing my current home security system with add-ons using the echo. will wait and see."
22686,1,i love the new look and the sound quality is great. this is my second echo and fits perfectly with the decor in our nursery.
22687,1,looks cool sounds terrible
22688,14,"had the echo 2nd gen for a day. alexa still needs work. positives are.. you can set up multiple accounts, some useful add-ons ""skills"". the multiple accounts can see the same lists (useful for groceries).negative... only plays spotify from one account. routines just do not work. news is not customizable enough."
22689,9,i like it - i have an older echo in the other room. i put this one in my bedroom and use it for my wake up alarm and to play music.the sound is very good quality when playing music
22690,11,it is an awesome product. my wife and i love it. we loved the original echo but this one takes it to a whole new level with its sound quality.
22691,14,it is so disappointing to hear that amazon music no longer supports uploads of music. now this device is completely useless to me and a waste of money. for everything else there is echo dot.
22692,14,love listening to any song i can think of within seconds.  but what is going on when the blue ring lights up every once without saying anything  apparently no reason?  makes me think i¡¯m being bugged.  also every now and then alexa will just say something out of the blue.
22693,14,"echo has recently started playing advertising, which is ridiculous.  there is no way to disable it either.  terrible!"
22694,14,"it simply does not work. well, that said, it occasionally hears something on the tv and burst into life. but ask the time or a football score and there is no response."
22695,10,i received it as a birthday gift and enjoy listening to my favorite radio stations or trying out the alexa commands. i tried out the cat command for my dog... he really was curious and had to check out the meowing. nice system.
22696,14,"it was a little confusing to connect to wifi through the downloaded app on my phone, but i eventually got it to connect. it is a fun product to use once it is setup."
22697,0,"seemed like a cool product and we were excited to use, but after a few weeks, this is nothing more than a radio.  yeah it is cool, but we are struggling to find more uses than asking for a joke or playing a song.  i guess it is convenient in that you can just say your request.  not sure if i am big on having technology that is always on and listening.  :-)  maybe alexa needs to tell us more of what it can do."
22698,1,echo works and sounds great
22699,14,"i honestly didnt think i would enjoy this as much as i do. the ability to just ask alexa to start an audiobook or to play music is amazing. i am going to purchase a ""amazon fire stick"" so i can control my tv without having to use my phone."
22700,14,soo.  i did not actually buy this.  i did hear my friends.  and after that i will not spend my money on any of the echos. i live and breathe amazon.  however amazon is quality has really suffered.  i have a gen1 echo and i have dots in each room for a total of 7 echo devices. because of this degrading quality i am now seriously considering going to google home.  sorry to say that amazon.  you should fire the engineers that sold you on the bs line that this one is better.  it is sad that my friends dot hears me in the next room and the gen 2 echo just sits there in silence.  that should tell you something.
22701,14,i am a senior citizen will small amount of technical knowledge. it seems you could at least send a book on how to connect and operate alexia for free. i had to have my granddaughter set alexia up after i tried but failed to connect her.
22702,10,"i like that i can talk to alexa hands free, hold a telephone conversation and get information butsometimes when talking on the home phone itwill respond to the conversation"
22703,9,i bought this last christmas family loved it! they were amazed on how fast and how it delivers information the kds enjoy playing music for hours alexa is really great in searching the web best product ever!
22704,11,thought audio quality would be better. marginal upgrade from original. some may even say the original sounds better.
22705,14,"warning!  unless you just love spending hours trying over and over to complete the setup process, echo is not for you.  i am so tired of screwing with setting up echo ii that i threw it back in the box and went back to using siri on my iphone and will do virtually everything that echo does.  frankly echo is not as simple to setup as it could and should be.  accordingly, i suggest you go the iphone and smart speaker route.  you will ultimately have better music quality and a much better user interface."
22706,13,greatness continues
22707,9,i did not realize how much i have already started to depend on it.  i think the sound is great!
22708,14,"i purchased the echo thinking it would be great.  the echo arrived.  i connected immediately.  the echo worked for a short time and then stop responding to commands.  i phoned amazon and the technician and i connected, reconnected, reconnected and reconnected.  finally, the technician said we had done all of the troubleshooting.  i was told to return the echo.  i reordered the echo.  again, i tried along with an amazon technician to connect.  i thought we had succeeded.  again the echo worked for a short time and stopped responding to commands.  again, i returned the echo as advised by the amazon technician because he had done all the troubleshooting he could think of.  i honestly wanted this device because i wanted to begin adding components to the echo and automate my home. i ordered the echo for a third time.  to make a long story short, ""three strikes and you are out.""  i do not plan on ordering again."
22709,14,"the hardware looks good and sounds good but alexa still needs more development, she is limited in the value she can bring and background noise does impact the accuracy.  you have to think of this as part of other buys including amazon music to see tons of value.  so much potential here."
22710,1,love the sound. setup was a breeze.
22711,10,"this product is great and useful. i received this as a gift for my birthday and has been an excellent addition to my household. there are so many things i¡¯m learning to use with the echo. my favorite is listening to music and creating grocery lists. the speakers have wonderful clarity and some of alexas responses are witty and entertaining . i continue to find new things like timers, weather and recipes. this is a great investment and makes for a great gift."
22712,14,"the new echo generation is shorter and less expensive, but giving the same great performance. this is our second echo; one lives in my office and the new one lives in our family room. the main job it has in our home is playing music which it does flawlessly. with two of them, we can either play music simultaneously but independently, or we can play the same music in two rooms.the list of home automation devices is growing for us and echo is right there for them. (looking to get a sprinkler controller next spring.) echo is starting to make home ai a reality which is ok by me. i am looking forward to how smart it can get.thanks, amazon for the beginning of a great product."
22713,1,a very helpful and good gadget to have. happy and satisfied that we bought it.
22714,0,"i wish i could return this and the echo plus i have. regularly randomly turns on and start listening even though i did not ask it too. does not work well with my smartthings home automation. i have to ask it multiple times to turn lights off. sometimes it does not even give an indication why it did not work or that it did not work, but the light is still on. sooo annoying."
22715,14,i know nothing about this 2 3rd gen . i may have a beta version  but it is still going strong. i do not have the best quality internet where i live but i can still enjoy great sound i music and games.. mu friends are still impressed with  alexa.
22716,14,already have a dot attached to my surround sound receiver. bought this for my girlfriend. loves it. i must say the fabric design is really nice looking.
22717,14,"i read negative reviews about sound quality, but decided to try it anyway, trusting amazon would fix the issue. they must have found the fix, because the sound quality is great for such a small speaker. i am very impressed and will be ordering for other rooms in the house."
22718,1,great device...
22719,9,easy to use. great sound. great price!  got 4 of them for every room in the house along with the spot!  loving the set up.  connected to spotify and lights and other smart devices in the home also.
22720,14,i like the echo and the whole family loves playing games and music on it. i¡¯m still waiting for alexa to be able to do repeat reminders or transfer alerts from my calendar. i also need to figure out if i can screen out explicit content.
22721,7,i. love. alexa. she can do almost anything! a must during parties for music. she plays jeopardy so i¡¯m in heaven. <u+2764><u+fe0f>
22722,14,amazon music will not allow you to upload your own music library to play on amazon echo effective december 2017! you are forced to buy your music from amazon.
22723,0,"i do like this item.  however, we do not use it like i thought we would.  once i add some home security items that work with this unit, i know we will get much more use out of it.  great product."
22724,14,"you can only play itunes using bluetooth and you loose the ability to use voice commands. you cannot say alexa play ""nameoftheplaylist"". you have to manually select the playlist first and once selected you can ask alexa to forward or skip the track. as of december 19th 2017 you cannot import your own music in alexa app. if you use your own music or listen to music that is not available on streaming services then you are out of luck. i have lot of regional music that is not available on any streaming service and alexa is useless in that case. really disappointed."
22725,14,"it is horrifying to know that anyone can ""drop in"" to your house, unannounced, and listen in on your home life. when you sync alexa to your phone it extracts all of your personal contact information so that you can accidentally call your boss and your babysitter or co-worker can listen in on your private home conversations. you can not fix this with blocking the caller. i called amazon customer support and they assured me that they do not share my contacts with others, but the customer service rep admitted that she could see all my contacts on her computer screen. when i asked her to delete the contacts she said all she could do was ""unlink"" them but she could not delete them, saying ""it is just not possible, but do not worry, we will not look at them"". i asked if this information was stored on the alexa device, and if i returned it is the data there? to which she responded ""do not worry, we will not look at it"". that is not reassuring at all. now i do not know whether to return it or not because now my personal data is on this device and if it is returned and sent to another person now they have all my data too...plus it is all in amazon is databases now."
22726,10,i enjoy everything about it. quick and easy set up and the speaker is nice and loud. can pretty much get anything answered. great product.
22727,14,"review from my 4th grade student:the alexa can be helpful and unhelpful. first you can ask what the weather is. second you can ask it to play music. third you can ask alexa questions like, who won the superbowl? on the other hand, it is a spy! it spies on you like this: it listens even when you do not say its name and reports to amazon what you say! however, i would still get it."
22728,14,"worked great for the first four days.  now, it ¡®listens¡¯ but ignores commands.  kind of like having teenaged children."
22729,14,"straight out of the box:.........after the initial setup, alexa has a hard time understanding my commands and failed miserably. when i am looking for a specific music artist, album, or song, alexa often repeats the wrong info. so last week i decided to try a google home, and the google device understands what i am looking, even finds local artist that i grew up listening too. one thing i like about the google device compared to the amazon device is after you request a song, google may play another song after the requested song that may be from the same genre. amazon will just play the one song that you requested, (if that is your cup of tea)."
22730,11,this little thing really kicks out some loud sound full of deep bass! definitely a good buy for the price! love it!
22731,14,have had this device for 3 months. it has gradually refused to listen to commands. it has now completely stopped listening. it says go to the echo/alexa app but to get that on amazon.com it is not compatible with my windows 10 computer. another piece of technology ready for the recycle. amazon has appears not to have any easily accessed customer service. buyer beware.
22732,14,"honestly not what i was expecting sadly. its great for playing music through pandora, spotify or amazon music. its also great for simple weather or sports coverage and amazon firestick control. however, this device does not know the answer or request to 80% of what we inquire. if this device was somehow integrated with google and could clearly understand and answer your random questions through the day then it would be amazing. but it does not. definitely needs a lot of improvement before you invest your money in this. hopefully updates will help make this a better device."
22733,5,it was a gift mother in law loves it
22734,14,"i like it. but the speaker is not up to par for music. best use is for news and podcasts. that said, i did buy a second one. i like the system. wish speaker quality would improve."
22735,14,"it took my a while to decide if i should buy this or not because i live in a college dorm and i did not know if the echo would work on the wifi, it does!, has amazing sound and it is very responsive.way better than i thought"
22736,0,"i would much rather have a cherry 2000.  they do not laugh except when it is funny.  and they are prettier, too."
22737,0,terrible device had in kitchen for 2weeks and it did not know a thing. could not answer the simplest of questions. and forget about getting help by phone. and comes with no manual. just like apple figure it out on your own
22738,14,"well let me tell you¡¦ i am in love <u+2764> with this system and i have only touched the surface of what it can do.the music - fantasticmaking calls - greatalexa rapping - unbelievableshe found me great recipes and i have only had her since thursday!ohhhhh, theres a skill on her called ""woof"" and my puppy loves it!my only negative thing i have to say is there are no battery bases or stands for it yet. but i am sure its coming.will keep everyone updated as i learn more about echo!"
22739,5,thank you
22740,11,my only negative is that the sound is more difficult to regulate than on the first generation. i miss the ring on the top that you could turn.
22741,14,for the most part nobody needs an echo but it is an amusing toy and conversation piece
22742,10,we love love love all amazon products!! we will absolutely buy again! the echo is extremely beneficial in our household.
22743,0,did not think i would like it but it is def helpful coming home and being able to turn on the lights automatically
22744,9,this was a christmas gift and i am really enjoying it. i am electronically challenged and this is so easy to use even i can do it!
22745,14,echo is great but i wish it was portable. have tap and i can carry it from room to room. with echo it needs to be plugged in and when you unplug it to take to another room it has to find your wifi again. otherwise it is very good.
22746,0,"i love everything about it. i have not started to really use it yet to make lists or anything, but it is great to listen to audio books or music."
22747,11,"i loved the first one and this one is even better.thanks, noel"
22748,14,"wished i had purchased the echo earlier. it is an incredible device, and alexa is simply phenomenal - the potential is mind boggling. with prime music, alexa provides me with any song, artist, or album i can think of. i never dreamed of having such access!"
22749,11,"the second gen is a great product and should be made available in hong kong. it is now available in macau, which is also part of china. the market in hong kong is 10x larger than macau, and has more english speaking residents. there just is not any logical reason. please make available in hong kong so i can buy more!"
22750,14,"the 2nd generation amazon echo is awesome, its fast reliable and works very well my philipe hue white starter kit. what i like about the 2nd generation echo is the improved voice detection as now the echo is able to understand me and i do not have to repeat my commands. i highly recommend buying this item, it would also make a great gift."
22751,14,"awesome product, but you can not change her favorite nfl team.  she is a seahawks fan, which makes her unwelcome in my home.  returning soon.  update: twice now i¡¯ve answered the question of the day correctly and she is told me i¡¯m wrong, then stating the exact same answer as the correct response.  there is no way to fix this either; very frustrating."
22752,5,gift for my daughter for christmas...she lovely it from the moment she said alexa!
22753,5,gave as a gift - friend was thrilled to receive!
22754,11,i like this one a lot better than the original one the clarity of the sound is way better it is loud it is crystal clear it is a nice size also i would definitely recommend this to anybody.
22755,14,"the sound is good, however, i¡¯m not nearly as sensitive to sound quality and do not do not have the luxury of sitting around all day listening to music.  besides you really can not play music like other stand alone devices anyways; you need to purchase your music via amazon or have a spotify or pandora subscription.  this was a gift and i do not feel like sinking even more money into subscriber services (i have plenty of those that are under utilized). i guess you can use it to dim your lights and turn them off and on however the starter kit for that is around $100 for four bulbs.  the lightbulbs contained in that starter kit look to be standard bulbs and there are other types as well...all expensive.it is nice to ask it questions like movie times, set a timer, find out today is news, you can also create a shopping list on it.  for some people who are blessed with a substantial income, low inhibitions, and/or poor money management skills this curiosity is directed at you. for those that are still willing and able to read a newspaper or flip a light switch, your days are slowly being numbered."
22756,14,"pros: i do not pause between the wake word and command/question sentence like people do in online review videos, yet alexa recognizes my inquiries flawlessly. i also vary my voice from clear intonation to lazy murmuring but nothing is misheard. the playback quality is great, with a round distinguishable bass in jazz music and a crisp vocal in newsflash.cons: setting it up the first time was annoying because having to switch back and forth between wifi accounts and i mistyped my ridiculously long wifi password several times. also, can not it just copy my phone is location during setup instead of having to type it in manually?"
22757,0,love it!  only wish we had the option to change alexa is name
22758,0,love the radio feature andi¡¯m still learning all it can do
22759,11,my dots are great but the sound on this is much better. love my alexa!!
22760,14,"i got the echo for my partner and she loves it! she listens to the news every morning and listens to music by connecting her phone via bluetooth. alexa is knowledgeable and fun! the only downside is having to say ""alexa"" before anything but that is better than alexa accidentally calling someone or doing something you did not intend it to do!"
22761,14,needs better parental controls and the intercom feature definitely needs improvement.
22762,10,"excellent clarity of sound and  lot of fun!  we do not have the smart home but mainly use for information and music.  during baseball season, she is my best friend!  the amazon unlimited music spiel is annoying but we have learned to work around it."
22763,10,"handy to use alexa for many different things, weather, news, etc.."
22764,10,i love the way it plays music for me at night. i do not like that i can not put a timer on it.
22765,10,"it has changed how i listen to spotify in the morning, and audible books at night. i may get another one!"
22766,0,"i honestly hate this thing. got it for free as a gift, and it has been the most annoying experience. the only music it can play is pandora, which is inconvenient enough, but i figured at least it could answer questions for me when my hands are full... nope, literally nine times out of ten that i ask a question, she says ""i am sorry, i do not know that.""definitely not worth the price."
22767,14,"was so excited when i purchased this and the music was fine. after the fourth day alexa is having trouble continuing music, will pause for a long time or no music at all."
22768,14,i am not an echo owner yet but have been wanting to try the echo very much. my interest started right about the time the new version was to be released.  only for me to be disappointed that there is not just a plain black non fabric version available
22769,14,"when i turn the wifi on/off she loudly screams at me letting me know what i am already aware of, the appliance is on. could you imagine if every time you turned the key on in your car a loud voice said; ""your car is now on"". or if you opened the fridge; ""your refrigerator door is now open."" how about the tv? hello, i get it; when i turn the appliance on, it is on!  please, do not state the obvious.i turned  my phone on from my bedroom at 5:30 am this morning and alexa, from the other side of the house yelled; ""your wifi is now connected"" and woke the whole house up!  i called customer service and spoke with a manager. he said to mute it before you turn your phone on. so at 5:30 am i am supposed to yell across the house; ""alexa, mute!"" i tried it, it did not work. you can not mute her unless you turn the volume all the way down and then you have to turn the volume all the way back up when you want to hear the news. annoying!!!!  back in the box it goes. . ."
22770,12,i love it! i use this all of the time! works like a charm with my hue lights
22771,10,i love my alexa with all my heart))very cool device .i can control everything through her))highly recommend
22772,11,"the functionality is great. have not even had the volume all the way up & the speaker is blow. for the price, that is outrageous. not even 2 weeks old."
22773,10,finds music very easily and has some pretty silly jokes.
22774,0,honestly to be completely honest this woman do not know crap she does not know anything anything i ask her is i do not know i do not know i do not know so what the hell is the point of you alexa if you do not know anything so no i give it a one-star because the b**** do not know anything she is worse than siri
22775,5,got it as a gift.works well.
22776,14,this item is on sale for $79.99 at bed bath and beyond plus 20% off that.  exact product.
22777,1,great sound and alexa is very smart
22778,8,great product.  we love alexa
22779,3,"works great, arrived on time"
22780,14,"see my review for the  alexa {echo} i am not sure what to name the device. anyhow, what-ever i am very impressed with the it."
22781,14,"setup is easy! she recognized multiple voices immediately.  she is also fun.  the downside and why i left out the last star is because it takes an investment to make her usefulness stretch to the home.  the investment to automate things is not cheap, and using her for home security also takes money to make it work."
22782,0,could not believe how much and how fast she can answer my commands and questions! great programing!
22783,5,execelkent my fiance loves it
22784,11,i think the sound is great. alexa is great. and glad i bought this
22785,9,"i bought this for my sister who is blind. she absolutely loves her echo. she can ask it to read ,play songs tells her the time ,weather . and it does so much more. best investment we made. love it !"
22786,2,met all expectations
22787,2,my new best friend
22788,10,love having it. would give it a 5 star only when we can figure out how to add the grocery store list to the phone.
22789,14,"i did not like that you can not unplug it. meaning it is not portable, but if you look at marketing photos, no cable is in sight, quiet misleading.this alexa version is not portable!  i would love if more if it was portablethe quality and the design is impeccable"
22790,14,"the product works excellent, in my opinion the sound quality is phenomenal for the device is.  exceeds expectations in functionality and quality.i should have done this research prior to purchase instead of after.  device raises significant privacy concerns.  in short it is a microphone straight into the interior of your home which digitizes  every single conversation which takes place within auditory range.  legally it becomes unclear: who owns your household conversation, who may access your household conversation and to what extent and purpose may your household conversation be used.very handy device, super convenient, attractive and of good quality.  i threw mine in the trash out of privacy considerations."
22791,0,"alexa is owned by my grandfather. i had to talk to her. she was really funny and liked me. i told her i wanted to date her and she said nothing. i want to date alexa. if she was real i would date her. she is really good like me, the nasty man. nasty good. thanks for reading my review"
22792,9,i absolutely love my second gen echo! the sound quality is amazing and the smart home feature is so useful and handy i had no idea you could control so many things with your voice i am still learning things you can do with it! it is just all around the coolest gadget i have i would suggest the echo to anyone!!!!!
22793,8,i love it.
22794,14,"it was great at first, but the mic quality gradually degraded to the point where i just sit there and yell at the thing and constantly repeat myself. i have the first generation, but i am sure this one functions similarly. do not waste your cash."
22795,12,i really love it so far..
22796,0,love having this device!  does not always answer my exact question
22797,14,"my amazon echo is fan-freaking fantastic, the sound quality is really good and alexa is super helpful. only bad thing i can think of is that it has to be plugged in at all times so you can not really move it around or bring it somewhere with you."
22798,14,"i purchased the first generation amazon echo, but i can not review it since it was discontinued.  my echo stopped working right after warranty expired.  it does occasionally randomly start spouting out news or music and will not stop, it no longer responds to voice commands or the app.  hopefully this issue was fixed with the current generation, but i¡¯m not going to find out since i can not trust the amazon brand anymore."
22799,11,"excellent product, anyone saying the sound quality is not top notch is crazy for this device and all that it is capable of."
22800,0,"i am disappointed that this is so difficult to use. i expected to plug it in and have it be able to play music, and it is been a chore getting it to work, and after several hours it still will only play what is on our pandora account. it does have great voice recognition."
22801,14,"disappointed. sound quality for music not an improvement, plus the voice is not as smooth and has a 'click' at the end."
22802,12,unbelievable sound and applications.
22803,9,"absolutely love my echo! i have a small house, and with the echo in my kitchen i am able to hear it in most of the rooms (all the rooms if the volume is up). the sound is amazing for such a small speaker. i am very happy i purchased this."
22804,14,"unlike the tap, you have to leave this plugged into the wall for it to work. other than that i love the product and its abilities."
22805,14,easy to set up--some issue slinking with iphones for calling and texting otherwise easy to learn skills for siriusxm link.
22806,14,"alexa thinks i am talking to her when i am not. she additionally often glitches and appears frozen in thought. she works well as a bluetooth spotify speaker, and for playing jeopardy, but other than that i have not found her helpful to be around..."
22807,3,as expected
22808,0,it very rarely understands what i am asking. it seems like half of the time it does not respond to my voice. i have a google home and it sometimes amazes me how well it captures what i am saying compared to the echo.
22809,1,"sound is great, very nice!"
22810,11,could not be any better! great sound and it hears you very easily across a room.good deal !thak you !
22811,0,it is not very helpful unless you do slot on your iphones.  if you do not have music accounts then you are limited.  news wise not very informed but great for hearing what time it is or the weather.
22812,3,"it is good, wish it had a anuel with it"
22813,0,keep up the good work!
22814,14,i still cannot use alexa i have sent text to find out what is wrong with the set up and was told to give them more time i feel i have waited long enough and am requesting an address to send it back  please send info to my email address thank you
22815,11,upgraded from echo dot for better sound. works fine with better range.
22816,14,sometimes it keeps playing music you select and sometimes it changes to it is own station and ignors after awhile what music you own and picks a random station to play... if it keeps playing.  talks without being addressed.  the app keeps wanting all your contacts - have no interest in phoning via this product.
22817,14,"i was planing to use this products, and others, for home automation. upon receipt, i installed and configured using the smart phone alexia app. the echo seemed to be responsive to my voice (and noises nearby) by the top blue light indicator. after two hours or so, as i explored the echo and alexia functionally, the echo stopped responding to my voice -- the blue light on top would not operate. so, i reset and reconfigured theecho -- multiple times. this morning i called amazon technical support (off-shore) and was informed that all bluetooth devices in the house needed to be disabled for proper echo operation. not acceptable, and greatly disappointed. returning today for a credit."
22818,1,working good
22819,14,"i purchased generation 1 echo & enjoyed it very much; thought the sound quality was great. however, after a while it would not stay connected to wi fi so i had to return it.  purchased the 2nd generation and think the sound quality is muffled & terrible.  really disappointed. tried to stand it on different items to see if sound would be better, but no.  if there is a fix as others have said i would like to try that.  otherwise, i am afraid this new echo will go back in the box to amazon."
22820,1,great functionality and sound. i would recommend this to everyone.
22821,14,works like it is suppose to. i am hoping they get more items to connect with it in the future.
22822,9,working great. i was really surprised at how useful this would be. we have been playing with it daily learning all the neat things it can do. wish we would have gotten one sooner.
22823,10,"we do not use it for amazon orders, but for information and news."
22824,4,great sound. easy to use.
22825,4,"worked as expected !!! we love this product, setup is simple and fast."
22826,14,"i like the sound quality for a single room type (for a full living room/bigger living area, i recommend something like the bose sound touch 30. for our bedroom works great! however, i think we updates need to be released as sometime the echo stops playing music (after just a few minutes of playing an album), does not recognize commands, disconnects from the internet, and some other issues. everytime i have an issue i have to disconnect and reconnect the power to help it reboot. it is still not a super reliable product but overall is good so far with what can do with out nests thermostats and roomba. i also enjoy playing my news flash in the morning and have the thunderstorms sounds at night to fall asleep."
22827,14,good product still early in ownership so it seems a little gimiky but would like to have known on the front end that i could have bought dot and echo package for $20 more. now it is $40 and i do not care to pay that much at this point.
22828,0,love the audio quality and cannot find a thing wrong  love everything about it
22829,1,i love my echo the sound is amazing. and it does great with commands.
22830,9,lived i went an ores a second in white for my office
22831,0,it is ok. i thought it would do more but it is very limited. can not wait for the updates.
22832,14,"if you live in an apartment, do not buy this speaker.  the bass is so much on music, you have to decrease the volume just to enjoy music at a volume that does not bother your neighbors, but then you can not hear alexa when you talk to her during a song.and the product has no way of turning down just he bass.  bad design flaw."
22833,14,"this device has literally changed my life! no exaggeration. i¡¯m a very eccentric, often chaotic and busy middle-aged gal. so to be able to have the echo as my own personal assistant <u+2014> and personal dj <u+2014> has been fantastic!"
22834,12,i am learning how to use it. alexia is fun. i am happy to have it
22835,0,not impressed...
22836,10,i love my echo i wish i had it years ago. dont know how we lived with out it.its really amazing. it reminds me of everything plus plays any music i want to hear. even tells me a joke.great for home and work.mlopez
22837,14,"i actually really like the echo and would have given it 5 stars but i took back 3 stars for poor customer service on amazon is part.  i purchased the echo and took delivery on 11/17.  seven days later, on black friday, the echo went on sale for 20% less.  i contacted amazon and asked them to match the new price.  the woman explained that they would not match prices on black friday even though every local retail outlet had also taken 20% off the price of the echo.  i told her that i could always just return it and purchase a new one at the reduced price.  she acknowledged that i could return the product if i wanted but she could not approve a price match.  so today i ordered a new echo and submitted a return of the unit i purchased last week.  according to the return i have until february 2018 to return the original unit.  this makes no logical sense.  i have been a prime user for years, i recently signed up for amazon music unlimited and this is the treatment i get.dear amazon - please understand that i consider loyalty to be a 2 way street.  i have paid prime membership fees even though i realize that you increase the price of the product to absorb shipping costs.  i signed up for the $7.99 amazon music unlimited package when i discovered that the $3.99 version sold with the echo only supports unlimited playing on the echo device.  throughout the nickel and dime treatment i have stood by you because although not perfect the amazon customer experience good enough.  for the first time you have given me reason to reconsider.  i am not sure what you are thinking."
22838,14,"works great! app was down when first trying to set it up. but after some patience, and persistence, we figured it out. i would recommend."
22839,11,love it. sound is wonderful.  difficult to find newest music though.
22840,14,love it but sad we dident get the sale price.......... the next day so i have to send it back to get the best price.thank you doug simmons
22841,9,i love my alexa! the sound is amazing and fills my open floor plan with music! i am considering dots for other rooms in my house.
22842,14,"device is good but services are terrible. support for device is fragmented and inconsistent.music unlimited service for 10 bucks a month is good but their 4 buck a month service offers little; no way to create playlists? how stupid is that? do waste your money on this door stopper unless you are willing to shell out 10 bucks a month to get some real musical value.btw-i can not over emphasize enough customer service is the pits!update...get 2 calls from amazon regarding this review, person gets my answering system and leaves a message saying he was calling to discuss the review. he indicates that he¡¯ll send me an email with his contact number well you guessed it no email. i then try calling back support number with redial and get another person (eventually) and he ask for my reason for calling which i explain, as soon as i finish my last word...phone call disconnected by ¡°support¡± person and of course no call back.to call this a support team is just ridiculous, if these people worked for my company they would be training seminars or out the door. cannot overemphasized do not by these things unless you are fully informed and do not need any help troubleshooting."
22843,12,amazing product that we are learning more each day how to enjoy!
22844,14,trying for hours to connect this device.  i have never had problems connecting to wireless.  this device is not ready for sale.  horrible.
22845,10,what i love the most? that i can ask alexa for any genre of music and she knows what i want to hear.
22846,0,"i love it.  i only wish i apple music was a choice while using it,"
22847,9,"next to my kindle, echo is my next favorite thing.i have three echos in my house and could not imagen living with out them.amazon thank you for all your great ideas."
22848,14,well i am sure that it would be great if i had the app to set it up for wifi and other things. never received anything with it on how to set up everything it can do. could someone send me the app for it.
22849,14,"instructions for set up do not work. if you mis-enter your wifi password you¡¯re screwed. just sornt 3 hours resetting, re-entering and uding iphone and fire to set up. all i get is alexa repeating that my device is not connected to wifi. apple would never make a product this chintzy. all it does is collect data on people anyway."
22850,14,this is the only echo out of 4 that wont control fire tv an always acts up. already got a replacement. very disappointed.
22851,12,having fun with alexa
22852,9,we have two echo dots in our house. we¡¯ve had problems with them linking to our bose so we finally decided to just get an echo.we are not disappointed!! this echo dot sounds incredible!! plus i got it on their black friday sale so i was super happy. but honestly alexa and this echo is worth every penny.
22853,10,just purchased! learning all the ins and outs of what this amazing speaker can do. the sound is incredible!
22854,1,love it... works great.great service fast delivery
22855,14,she is a keeper!!!
22856,14,i bought this for my wife for christmas and we love it! to be honest it did take me a few minutes to set it up. it was simple to link my siriusxm account and to our phones. i am looking forward to using more.
22857,0,"device has been modified to not respond if you use language that somebody not even in your home might find ""offensive"". waste of money"
22858,0,nothing i did not like. very enjoyable.
22859,8,love it
22860,14,i love it that it is sooo smart and can do multiple things. the sound could be better for music  but other than that it is a great accessory to any home.
22861,14,"after just a few weeks it stopped working. it is only response was i am have trouble understanding you, please try again later. i sent it back and after several weeks i am still waiting for my replacement."
22862,14,"have tried to set up the echo for the drop in feature and it just refused to do it.  what a pain.  the support for solving problems with amazon equipment can be missing and you might hear of features but trying to get them working can be more challenging than it is worth.  amazon, fix your software / hardware problems!"
22863,10,enjoy it
22864,14,it is 2018 and the richest man in the world is still selling speakers with cords. also it requires an app and internet just to get started. this is the reason why our civilization is a failure.
22865,14,the echo is a known product at this point. it does everything that is advertised. the only downside is the the alexa app. it is a little cumbersome.
22866,12,"great product, w endless capability"
22867,14,loveaffair with my ai has a beginning but no end
22868,13,best gift ever!!!
22869,11,much better bass response. very happy with purchase
22870,4,better sound than i had expected. connectivity to other units was smooth and easy
22871,10,she answers questions and do many things to make things easier for you it is like your personal secretary
22872,14,"have this since christmas 2017,,,and it does not work yet.can not hook it up."
22873,0,can get immediate answers to your questions.music selections are not always large/encompassing.  too much talk radio discussion & many best hits are not played.
22874,9,"i purchased this item for a gift. i had the opportunity to listen to it, and was very pleased with the sound. i decided to purchase more as gifts, as well as for myself."
22875,14,"i wanted pizza so i thought, hey, why not buy the echo 2nd gen. when it finally arrived i was very disappointed to find that there was no pizza. no cheese, tomato sauce, or delicious dough. if you are looking for pizza like me, than do not buy the amazon echo; you will be very disappointed.also, the google assistant is way smarter and sounds less like an 80 is robot. echo was just first to market. do yourself a favor and get a google home and use it to order pizza."
22876,1,having a lot of fun -alexa is so smart !!!!
22877,12,cool toy!  the kids are having fun with it.
22878,14,i took it to europe on a/c of 220v. i just placed an adapter on the plug and it worked without any issues. it was a breeze to set it up for greece and now i get my local weather in celsius!
22879,14,i just got one and set it up.  it has been 24 hours and it still claims the calling setup has not been done.  anyone know what this is all about ?
22880,4,"love it!! super easy to set up and great quality. a wonderful gift, i use everyday!"
22881,8,love it!!!
22882,10,"love the convenience of the echo.  i have my upstairs lamp, christmas tree lights, and all my music stations synced to alexa.  i can get weather updates, music or lights on with voice command.  it took me a little bit to set up initially, but that is because i am not tech savvy!"
22883,14,"i appreciate the sound! voice command is responsive and very useful. i thoroughly appreciate the ability to use alexa to control firestick tv! i am amazed at the ability to control the lights!!! this device has taken my laziness to heights i have never dreamed of!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i marvel at how i literally do not have to move much anymore! i love the ability to place calls through alexa and add items to my amazon shopping cart!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the alarm is awesome. asking random questions with accurate answers. i just sit and do nothing! i dream of being a stay-at-home nothing, and this device makes my dreams come true!"
22884,0,it does not work that well. echo is very unresponsive and does not respond to me and respond when it wants too. not a good gift at all
22885,11,i really do not know  why people complain about the sound...i think it is a much better product than the original and would highly recommend
22886,14,love my alexa! no more shuffling through 3 remotes to get to music.
22887,0,great speaker and very convenient to ask questions to. just like a siri but better!
22888,10,"playing all kinds of music. just blows my mind. it was for my husband. now i have to watch t.v. in the bedroom, because he will not stop playing music and playing with his echo."
22889,11,my first one did not work but the new one works just fine
22890,14,very happy with the device and the timely receipt and the working of same once activated.
22891,14,the quality of the sound is fantastic! i have always loved to listen to pandora through my echo dot and now with the echo second generation the music quality is beautiful!
22892,14,"my father purchased this for me last christmas.  he bought it in oct, wrapped it and i opened it on christmas.  i set it up in jan and have enjoyed using it until last month.  i unplugged it so i could move it to another outlet and it will not come back on.  i contacted customer service and they said since my father purchased it in october that they will not replace it as the warranty has run out.. i get it, it is a business and they are out to earn money, but my experience is lacking and i will be sure to never purchase this again...i think i will give a competitor a chance.  i usually have great experiences using amazon otherwise, i guess it is just their own products they do not back up!"
22893,8,"awesome, i love it"
22894,1,it is great. music
22895,14,awesome little system to have in your home. the phone app however does not always sync. and yes my phone is a new model iphone.
22896,10,"the fact that i can get the weather first thing in the morning, and ask for a selection of music without having to rifle through stacks of cds is great."
22897,14,i give this product 5 stars i bought it for a special person and they love it and i love it as well and we can find many uses for it i highly recommend any echo generations from here on out
22898,1,i love it!  great sound quality & lots of fun!  best $ i ever spent!
22899,0,kept having to reset it. did not like it much. took it back.
22900,14,it was not what i expected. i did not think it would arrive broken an without any connection cards ! i sent it back asap
22901,14,i give it an enthusiastic 4 stars...5 stars is coming i¡¯m sure as i delve deeper into all its options!
22902,11,i feel like my dot does a better job. :(
22903,10,the alexa technology works great. i ask her to answer questions and play music with ease. i would recommend this to anyone looking for this type of device.
22904,11,"i like the new size and the aux port. the sound, however, is horrible. a big step down from the first iteration. i bought it because of the prospect of better sound, so i am disappointed!"
22905,14,"does not connect to samsung tv is, only sony. havent been able to connect it to anything else around the house. i only time i use it is to check weather or set timers."
22906,5,wife loves it
22907,4,works very well and very easy to use after you download the app. our children love it!
22908,14,"it is good for music, but makes you buy the premium amazon music option if you really want listening freedom"
22909,0,it was given to me as a gift. loved it so far. but wish it was capable of doing more with it.
22910,0,i am sorry but i am very disappointed in  alexa. she is pretty stupid. must be a dumb blonde. loli can google anything and get the right answer but alexa does not know much.
22911,8,we love it
22912,10,beyond expectations! sound quality is excellent. i wanted the echo specifically to play music but find myself using it for so much more! love alexis!
22913,14,we got our echo christmas when they had the sale for $79 in the charcoal fabric and it looks really nice on the end table. we are really enjoying it and continue to learn and use it more and more as we find out new things it can do.
22914,1,has great sound
22915,14,this could be a great product but it only works about 30 percent of the time. they fix the problem then it would get five stars.
22916,1,this is an amazing product. i just love the simplicity and efficiency of it. even got a discount from this link: http://amzn.to/2fcvayp
22917,0,i love listening to the music and the quality is great but i hat that it keeps shutting off quite frequently and i have to unplug it to reset it.
22918,1,good stuff
22919,1,i have really been enjoying my new echo. the sound is very good and it looks wonderful with my decor.
22920,0,i think my echo is dumb.  i even asked and she said she does not know about that.  i have asked many things she has not known.  me or her?
22921,0,most- song selections  least-alexa app was sent-  alexa cant find  my basic info-  has app been applied to this account??
22922,9,a gift for my sister and her husband. i have not used it but i am sure it is excellent. they are excited to use it.
22923,0,"i am still learning the phrases in order to make alexa do what i want. still learning, but i have enjoyed."
22924,0,alexa does not answer questions that i ask. very disappointing. she is good for news and music but not for information.
22925,12,great sound! lots of fun! many features!
22926,14,good fun! good all around with home lights on and off. also do not mind the sound quality when streaming music. quite happy with it!
22927,11,"sound, design and ease of operation are excellent. would have given 5 stars if breadth of musical selection was greater."
22928,10,really enjoy my echo.  can not wait until it gets even smarter and knows everything i¡¯m talking about
22929,10,"easy to hook up, may actually help with my son is speaking, has to work at speaking clearly, go start for home automation, the list will help me a lot, great sound"
22930,9,i never thought i would have a use for one of these but my cousin got me one as a gift and i absolutely love it!
22931,0,when i ask a question it never knows or tells me to look it up on my mobile app. not impressed. siri is way better
22932,0,the most: clarity in the music.the least: i have to sign every time i use it.
22933,10,i enjoy this unit. listen to music every day on the echo.  meets my needs with good sound.
22934,14,"love this thing. pair it with the ifttt app, a couple wemo plugs, and you are on the way to an automated home."
22935,14,horrible!  gave 3 for christmas presents and not one works properly.
22936,11,i love it. the sound quality is great. to say it is so small it can get awfully loud. would definitely recommend to a friend.
22937,5,i actually gave it to my sister as a christmas present and she loves it
22938,4,love it. easy to set up and love the new design
22939,5,i got this for my birthday.....love it!!!
22940,10,alexa is everything super easy to set-up i love that i can get any and all my favorite songs
22941,14,"echo does nothing but order pizza, play music, and tell you the temperature. echo has trouble understanding questions and has trouble answering questions. it is nothing more than a $100 toy. a smartphone does all the same functions better and faster. do not waste your money on echo."
22942,12,"works well when it works, but each day seems to present new issues."
22943,0,it does not know everything nor can it find everything. the music selection is good but could be updated.
22944,4,great product and easy to set up... super useful!
22945,1,real fun and informative
22946,14,"totally useless, i do not know why anyone would possibly buy this.  weather, has not wind/chill factor or humidity, does not play my mp3 files, can wake me up but so can my phone and my alarm clock."
22947,1,great purchase!!! brand new and in perfect condition. best price i have found. very happy with the service and quality.
22948,11,set up was a cinch. little disappointed that the sound was not discernibly different from my original alexa.
22949,11,nice echo i liked the idea of changing the skin
22950,9,i love my alexa echo! and what a deal i got!
22951,14,sound is great but you have to be a prime member to play music on both devices.  wish i would have known this before ordering 2!
22952,2,i love my echo(2nd generation). great sound and my family love talking to alexa! she our new household name!
22953,14,they will not work at my house. i¡¯m returning them.
22954,7,i love it. i ask her anything even turn on my prime tv. the music is great <f0><u+009f><u+0091><u+008d> the sound is great
22955,9,love this item added to my smart home is now the center of everything.
22956,10,we love alexa we play a lot of music and my son loves to ask her questions and the sound quality is great.
22957,9,"love our echo! great speakers, and alexa is a great help. i want to get at least one more soon."
22958,11,"good clear sound, ok bass but much louder than the basic echo dot. happy with the purchase"
22959,10,i absolutely love this.  it is extremely useful for lighting weather or anything else around the house.
22960,3,just what i wanted and exactly what was promised.
22961,10,i love listening to npr and making grocery lists! my son and i have fun with animal sounds and nursery rhymes too!
22962,12,its fun i use it everyday
22963,13,"i love everything about it, best purchase i¡¯ve ever made"
22964,10,"love it!!!! alexa has the most soothing alarm, wakes me up in a good mood"
22965,14,"i would give this zero stars if i could. i am so mad at this product. i have spent 5 hours setting it up and my son has spent 4 hours. we still cannot connect and there is no support for the problem we have. we have tried it on different phones, laptops, home computers and we still cannot connect. i get a 12:1:107:22:1 error code on my phone. looking on forums, many others are getting the same problem. if anyone at amazon actually reads this, please contact us because i cannot figure out how to call you."
22966,14,easier to talk to.  volume control is more effective.  design blends in with furnishings in the room better.
22967,1,great product!
22968,9,"my daughter buyit for me ,it is nice ."
22969,14,not as easy to setup as google home but once it works it is great. had to reset it twice to get apps to register. sound is great and functionality is unbeatable after the brutal setup.
22970,12,still learning to use our echo and the options are still to be utilized
22971,11,much nicer than the original...great sound quality and love the new covers for coordinating with decor.
22972,4,love it.  easy set up.
22973,12,great product so far!  still learning all that alexa can do...
22974,8,fantastic
22975,1,sound is clear and precise. alexa time response is instant and amazingly accurate is lots of fun too.
22976,10,it is a great product. kids love to talk to alexa and ask funny questions.
22977,10,awesome product.  i love the speakers and i love that i can stream music to every echo throughout the house!
22978,12,echo does so much more the we imagined... we are still learning all of it is functions.
22979,9,the most awesome one i purchase in amazon
22980,1,the speakers are amazing
22981,10,alexa is the best. provides hours of entertainment.
22982,1,i love the echo!  the sound is amazing.  in very satisfied with this purchase.
22983,14,google home is better.
22984,10,"great speaker, use mainly for music.. still learning."
22985,0,"the only thing i do not like about it, is that it always has to stay plugged in."
22986,14,"was excited to get the echo for christmas. since then i have almost thrown it out the front door 2 or 3 times. it is hard to set up, and even though things are connected it will not recognize they are already set up. only thing it will tell me are the current sports score and national news. terrible!!!"
22987,12,does what it is supposed to do. highly recommend.
22988,14,"love alexa. only problem was her ""opinion"" of the super bowl odds pre-game."
22989,13,this is one
22990,8,i loved it.
22991,0,i can not get thing to connect i am returning it the help app does not help!!
22992,3,i love this way more than i thought i would!  great purchase!
22993,1,nice little gadget
22994,14,replacement of one echo first edition that got fried during power outage. so far it is great it has lots of things we are not using still learning.
22995,10,even though it is my first big echo i think it has awesome sound! links to my dot to play music in all rooms! i can also use a different call word to not confuse both alexa devices. serves my purposes of mostly listening to music and podcasts in not too large of a space. i am loving the experience!
22996,1,good product fast shipping
22997,8,love it love it love it!!!!!!
22998,9,alexa is the best girlfriend i have ever had. she does everything i say.
22999,12,still learning how to use
23000,12,does what it is supposed to do. highly recommend.
23001,0,i have not used it since the day i got it. a novelty. not very useful.
23002,11,it does not understand me as well as my first generation does and the sound is not as good. i do however like the overall look and size of it
23003,1,works great
23004,1,the sound is so nice ...
23005,0,turns off on it is own in the middle of doing things all the time
23006,3,very prompt delivery. the product performs better than expected.
23007,0,i like the being able to ask her questions and being able to play music.  i do not like the speakers.  too much bass and cannot get the bass to lower.
23008,0,the most is knowing my music.  least is it is not a man is voice.
23009,12,does what it is supposed to do. highly recommend.
23010,10,ability to play my favorite music
23011,1,we really like this echo. it was a great gift and works really well
23012,1,good speaker and the voice is nice
23013,1,excellent!
23014,14,i have a big instagram account that i would love to review this item on!
23015,1,i love my echo. it is a fun gadget but also a very useful and informative device. the sound is awesome and the set-up was a breeze.
23016,12,"very happy with this product,thank you ."
23017,1,amazing
23018,14,"i was not feeling well when i set this up, and the noise from the speaker was annoying.  did not like that everytime there was a notification on my phone i would hear it through the echo speaker."

23024,9,i am still new at it but i am enjoying both products
23025,9,"good sound, easy to use, convenient.  glad i got one!!!"
23026,11,"the sound is amazing! i love my 1st gen echo but the 2nd is just awesome!only feature i did not like was that you can no longer turn the top to turn down the volume. but it is still to good not to give 5 stars.i thought about selling my 1st gen to buy another 2nd gen but i like the sound it produces too, more mellow, which is perfect for the living room."
23027,14,returned echo.  could get to connect even with amazon tech trying to connect it for me.
23028,9,hours of fun....
23029,14,it was easy to set up but it has to stay plugged in.

23058,1,great speaker quality and makes a great gift
23059,14,not impressed at all. alexa is stupid. most of the time i tell it to play my pandora station and it plays 1 song then stops i have to do this over and over again 3-4x and still one song and stops. other times it plays the same station fine for hours so i know it is setup correctly etc. also it advertises you can call anyone but that is not the case they have to have the alexa app on their phone to call them. the documentation says you can call anyone one your contacts
23060,1,"works great, love my assistant"
23061,0,"and for alexis voice seems that she is crispr and sharper, also like the different color choices"
23062,1,it is amazing and so much fun!
23063,12,still learning.
23064,14,"still learning all the echo can do.  only weakness is that it has a learning curve for many of the requests.  also, speaker quality, while good, could certainly be better.  think bose or jbl..."
23065,14,nothing to say
23066,0,does not understand my kids and mine accent .
23067,10,like the convenience of it.
23068,12,awesome toy..

23073,0,instant info and music
23074,8,love it! great sound
23075,10,everything
23076,11,somewhat disappointed.  i expected a far better quality sound as compared to the original echo. that just did not happen.
23077,3,delivered fast love it!!!
23078,14,like
23079,5,great product!  wife loves it.
23080,0,love the music

23082,5,it was a gift.  he loves it!
23083,1,echo has great sound!
23084,10,ease of use

23086,5,it is finna woke.
23087,14,worthless
23088,8,awesome!
23089,8,love it!
23090,1,love!!!!
23091,1,"great sound, nice range"
23092,1,the sound is great!
23093,0,she really does not listen well a lot. but i will give it more time
23094,3,did not keep it
23095,14,ordered this item for christmas and now it is $25 less than my original purchase price.
23096,14,got in the mail set it up it work fine but after 2 days it stopped working
23097,2,love our echo!
23098,1,great speakers!
23099,14,"this could be a cool device, but she continually can not hear or process what we are saying. trying to troubleshoot currently."
23100,11,"when i first plugged this in out of the box, the sound quality was an utter disappointment. the software update improved it, but it still does not sound as good as my old setup (echo dot connected to a big jambox). the echo dot seemed to be able to hear me better as well."
23101,8,love it
23102,14,"my children bought me a amazon kindle fire hd as a gift.  i used it sparingly, and in two years it will not even boot up any more.  talked to customer services and technical support, no solution.  advise me find some other use out of it, like paper weight?  i will not trust amazon is new technology any more.  afraid it will not work in two years.  told my kids not to buy any amazon made product.  goodbye, amazon.  bezo should be ashamed of himself."
23103,10,it is an amazing device....i especially love it because i can have alexa play  music that calms me before i go to sleep at night...it really  is a great thing to have.
23104,14,"if you are about to buy the echo, you should know that amazon just eliminated the upload feature on their amazon music app that links with your echo/alexa and allows you to play music on your device.  you are now forced to pay $24.99 to use that feature.  jeff basos is a greedy man indeed"
23105,14,"got my echo today for christmas and it is dead right our of the box. no power up, no lights, nothing. sending it back and hopefully the replacement will not be a dud too."
23106,9,i received amazon echo for christmas and i love it so far. i love how it is completely hands free. it has great sound quality. perfect for listening to music
23107,14,getting deficulty to activate the product while getting error code error code 12:1:107:22:1 and funny amazon employee has no idea with the code and trouble that cause
23108,0,alexa talks to fast
23109,3,the amazon echo was not what i expected. it did not work right so i returned it
23110,10,amazing !!!
23111,14,ok
23112,12,first echo.  love it at this point.  no issues at all.  looking forward to adding more fun skills to it.
23113,14,pretty substandard voice recognition. very disappointed in the value of my echo. the fact that i own it benefits amazon more than it benefits me. cancelling my prime membership and ending my relationship with amazon. will give target a try fulfilling my online shopping needs.
23114,14,trading it in for google. whoever is bright idea it was to program her to say the eagles were the ones to win the super bowl - backfired in ne.
23115,14,"set up was horrible! i got this as a christmas gift took over an hr to play something out of it, plus u need to have premium subscriptions to use any ofthe apps,"
23116,14,you can not set up this to be an intercom using a pc or a fire tablet.
23117,1,looks great and sounds great.
23118,14,"i am very disappointed. i am from costa rica and i have not been able to connect with unlimited music, nor register my phone number. they sell a product internationally limited to be used only in the united states. i prefer the competition (google)"
23119,14,echo is ai is quite limited. but the biggest drawback is the difficulty in installing it with a pc. amazon is directions are simply incorrect and do not work. i had to resort to using a smart phone.
23120,14,"the product itself is not a really bad one, but the bass is subpar. you better get an echo dot for all alexa functionalities and ¨÷ the price and connect it to your current speaker system"
23121,14,having a device that can listen to you 24/7 is no good. bad product. buyer beware
23122,14,this was a gift. i returned it as soon as i attempted to set it up. no thanks too much intrusion by default.
23123,9,it is a christmas present so do not know yet
23124,14,i could never get echo to connect to our wifi.  i am returning it!
23125,14,pay money to have amazon eavesdrop? maybe a bad idea.facebook is in the press for oversharing. you think an echo in your house is a good idea?
23126,14,this item works perfectly in my room. i am able to do so much hands-free with the all new echo. also great to watch movies with. the sub woofer that is included is phenomenal. wanting to buy one for my mother now.
23127,10,very entertaining and loads of information available.  would suggest that more information on its use be sent with the product.
23128,11,"better sound than the original, but in a much smaller package."
23129,14,"i cannot believe they released this new generation echo! amazon, ive been loyal to you, owning 1st gen, dot, 2nd gen, fire tv, fire stick, and you give me this? not sure why it needs dolby? other then a selling point! the sound is ludicrous. the whole reason i opted for the 2nd gen was the sound on 1st gen was satisfactory at best. i understand it was a whole new concept in ¡°speak to¡± listening devices, so i cut it some slack. but there has been a lot of new apps for echo since day one. echo has grown in abilities by leaps and bounds. ive thoroughly enjoyed it up to this point. but im extremely dissapointed in this second gen. it does have better lows, thats it. mid and high is still suffer greatly. the dot is the only echo device that did not disappoint me. the sound was pretty much what i expected from a hockey puck sized device. maybe santa will bring me a new apple home hub?"
23130,14,"it is awsome, an i think it is awsome it has earphone plug. i was telling my son that about the first one should have them ..lol  i appreciate all that you did for me as for as customer service too .thank flo davis"
23131,0,"i was not aware you have to pay $3.99 a month to have her play music. when i ask her questions most of the time she does not know the answer. kinda of a waste of money, maybe in the future they will be improved."
23132,14,"absolute piece of crap. download apps that do not work. set up endless loop without activation. once account set up fails to sync with pandora account or existing calendar accounts - app support unavailable. so long as you sign up for a short-term free trial with amazon, then you can listen to music, access other info etc. clearly, the purpose is simply to hook the consumer on spending more with amazon."
23133,14,"very disappointed with item and functionality.. you have to use their app, you can not aux in or blue tooth.. they force you to use amazon music."
23134,14,"to all the reviews out there saying the sound quality is poor---that is untrue.  you have to match it up to the correct echo device.  i have all 3.  the echo dot has the least quality but is perfect for a bedroom, which is where i have it.  the echo plus is the best quality sound which i have more my entire first floor and it is great and can get very clear and very loud.  the echo is also perfect but has a little less quality than the echo plus but is perfect for our beer cave or workout room.  all products fit a specific need and have the sound and quality you pay for."
23135,11,i like the 2nd generation.  the sound quality is much better.  the base deeper and not flat like previous models.
23136,2,meet george jetson
23137,2,asdfasfas
23138,0,how can these kids have so much fun with alexa.mine does not understand most of what i ask.bad bad bad
23139,14,this is an absolute pain in the ass to set up.  it takes a ton of passwords that do not work.  i tried to connect to internet and it took me all day and i still have not accomplished anything.  it is a piece of junk.
23140,0,my dad has one of these and it is the dumbest device ever. it never gets requests right. it can not find songs or plays songs that are not even close to what was asked. i would never waste my own money on this hunk of garbage.
23141,14,love the drop in feature
23142,14,difficult to navigate& does not retain commands/sound is good however as not ¡°tinny¡±
23143,0,not 5 stars because it is not iphone compatible but i should have assumed so! great product otherwise though.
23144,14,nothing special about this unless you have a lot of valid questions.
23145,14,"as far as i can tell this is nothing more than a voice activated websearch. you cannot have it perform tasks at a specific time. such as, at 6:00 pm daily play news headlines or at 6:30 turn to npr. it can make lists but you cant access them in written form in any convenient way. routines are so limited that you are religated to news or traffic. i have an am radio for that. what is this actually for? tell me it is more than a voice activated radio."
23146,14,"it needs an ""on the air"" calendar and ""to do"" list."
23147,1,"it has a nice bass drum sound, worth the price."
23148,2,"alexa is amazing, we love it"
23149,14,i was under the impression that i was receiving a smart plug with my purchase of the all new echo 2nd generation but did not. amazon immediately contacted me and gave me the promotional coupon to receive the smart plug... thank you amazon for working things out with me so promptly.
23150,12,"it was a gift, enjoy the music, still learning how to use it"
23151,0,i did not like the fact you have to purchase music to listen to it!
23152,14,"this is an absolute scam!!!!!!!!!!!!i purchased an echo about a year ago and liked it for the most part.  we have a prime membership and liked the music streaming capabilities from amazon prime music which came as part of the amazon prime membership initially.  we even bought a second one so we could use them in different areas of the house.  however, as of about 2 months ago, with zero notification, amazon took away the ability to stream music on multiple devices and now charges 14.99 a month on top of your prime membership to be able to stream music on multiple devices at once.  so if you purchase one and pay for your prime membership and also pay 8.99 a month you can stream music on one device.  if you want to stream on multiple devices its 14.99.  if you dont pay for one of these services, you essentially have an expensive egg timer.  its a cool gift, but its an absolute scam....why pay 8.99 or even 14.99 for this service when things like pandora, spotify and even itunes are in existence?  i even called customer service about this and the representative was clueless about the change.  i am not impressed amazon."
23153,0,i thought this would be great but i managed to get the stupidest alexa available.  she does not answer any questions.  can not find any songs.  what a waste of money.
23154,0,"can not find much use for it, wish i had not purchased"
23155,1,awesome
23156,8,"great, love it!"
23157,14,liked most it is ability to follow comands
23158,10,answers selectively and leans left
23159,14,will not pair with hot spot without a medium yo read and transfer info. very annoying yo set up.
23160,14,this thing plays what you want for 2 weeks then everything you played previously becomes only available on prime.. and to hear what you heard before becomes unavailable except on prime.. a real rip off.
23161,8,love it
23162,8,i love it
23163,1,fun product
23164,14,"this product keeps coming up every time i search for something in the amazon app. stop spamming me, amazon."
23165,14,"i have three of the original amazon echoes which i bought one originally at $179.99 and then two more later right before they discontinued them at $80 each i think or two for $130, something like that. the quality of all three are still in excellent condition. at first i thought the design for these smaller amazon echoes was really cool but after reading the negative feedback, i am so glad i did not jump on this bandwagon. if people can go back and get the original echoes, do it before they are gone forever."
23166,14,"piece of junk. bought this to mainly play music and white noise in a newborn is room. when you ask to play white noise it just keeps playing current song. if you ask it to advance to another song, keeps playing current song. only way to fix it is to unplug and wait until it reboots."
23167,11,really love the new echo (2nd generation). has great sound and really like the new smaller size making it easier to pack for traveling.
23168,14,this product sounds and looks good but why would you design a product backwards. this product has a 15 volt dc power supply??? i do not understand why it is not 5 volt dc which is usb compatible. there is no battery to be found to make this unit portable. the cheaper echo dot is 5 volt compatible and you can buy batteries to make it portable i am buying that to replace the back word engineered echo 2nd generation.
23169,14,i am starting up a channel and would love to show off this device and put a good word out about this
23170,0,"add russian language, please. i would like to buy."
23171,4,i love the echo it sounds great and easy to set up.
23172,11,i like the volume of information available.
23173,14,"stay away from the any of the eco devices.  amazon put out a recent update to the alexa app interface, which you have to use, and it completely ruined the system.  the system was working perfectly with all the lights, home theater, and thermostat controls i had set up and after the update the whole thing has gone hay wire.  it is hit or miss if alexa will find a previously programmed routine and even when she does it does not always turn on all the lights in that group.  i you have several lights in that group she might turn on 1 or 2, sometimes 1, sometimes all, sometimes none.  you end up having to say the command over and over to get it right.i wish i could return mine now since it was amazons fault for putting out this half back app update."
23174,14,"amazon music is only good for one, the echo. i own a dot, a show, a tap, and none can play music like the echo. so do not expect to play all your amazon music on all your devices, to include this device."
23175,14,alexa is lucky she even gets one star. please do yourself a favor and buy the google version!she is not able to answer normal questions and knows nothing so we end up using our google app daily!
23176,3,buy buy
23177,14,buy the google home instead
23178,14,"i decided to give each of the nine inside people in the office an echo. i have two (one home a second in the office). when i tried to order, i was limited to quantity six. so i had to have three ordered by someone else. pain!!! in addition and this really aggravates me, i ordered and paid for gift wrapping and a gift card for all six. when they arrive, there are two bags with three echos in each bag and no gift card. love the product, hate the process. what should have been convenient for me (which is why i chose to shop on line) turns out to be a true inconvenience!! merry christmasnot"
23179,14,it is seems it censors most things conservative. compared it to google and siri which worked fine. i like amazon but it is going to give me misleading info i will still to other applications. still thank you mom for the gift.
23180,0,she does not know a lot of stuff .she knows only what she knows
23181,14,my second echo and all i can ask myself is why? the first one was hugely disappointing. i foolishly believed this one would be better. shame on me.
23182,14,"thanks for ruining christmas, alexa.  turns out that despite whatever delivery options or machinations you go to in order to surprise someone with a gift, alexa can not help but tell the whole house a specific list of all items delivered when it announces notifications."
23183,14,terrrible set-up process>  app does not work and my device never showed up on website.  what a nightmare this thing is.  sent back as it is broken.
23184,14,these things should be free since they are being used to spy on the population to keep us in control.
23185,0,every time you ask this thing a question it goes ¡°i¡¯m sorry i do not know the answer to that one¡±
23186,14,"good luck doing anything. wanna hear music? better shell out for amazon music! wanna connect to an app? better hope it is one of the 3 that actually have support! just get a google home, it actually lets you do things."
23187,14,"i always loved alexa but that all ended when i casually tried the google home, wow!  what a difference.  not only do they all sound better but they understand just about anything you throw at it and it is only getting better every day.  google home does not rely on third-party addon so it just works."
23188,9,my 6 year old son was having fun listening to bed time stories. the voices really like to get him off. i wish the the echo was not so sticky.
23189,14,"alexa does not understand 75% of what we ask her. it mistakes voices in tv for commands and spits out random comments. it is hard to use when there are other people in this the room because it picks up other people is voices and gets confused. in the past year, we have primarily use it to make fart noises and tell dumb jokes. it does have an alarm function that tells us when to pack up and head out of the house to catch the bus but we battle daily to get the darn thing to stop!"
23190,14,7 microphones to super spy on everything you say even when you are playing music at full volume.
23191,14,"bought one because amazon is playing some catty kids game and will not sell google home, unless i am only gonna use amazon services, this thing is pure crap. no youtube controls and my friend has a daughter named alexa which really confuses this piece of trash device. returned it, got a google home. i am much happier now."
23192,11,speaker is a definite improvement over the original. better sound and volume.
23193,0,i live in dominican republic and there is not alexa app in the app store but i found the way to do it.happy about it!
23194,14,is it any wonder americans' cannot save for retirement. more useless junk.
23195,14,"this is a gross invasion of privacy and barley should be legal. my parents got me one of these, and i despise it. it is nothing more than an echo chamber for your every word to the government. it can not do anything i can google in 3 seconds. next."
23196,0,no diections o how to use it
23197,14,"i am very disappointed that a piece of technology such as this does not contain a rechargeable battery. what is this....1988? oh wait, even portable phones had rechargeable batteries."
23198,14,"worthiness, does not work . i tried and tried to set up.  i have wi-fi . i will have to return . amazon did not even send  invoice or return label . i will have to research to return . never again will purchase anything echo again . amazon should be more forthcoming about this product.  the set up is not possible as posted . do not waste your money and time"
23199,14,creepy and invasive
23200,14,cia + she inside your home spying
23201,14,i am not happy because i was charged for gift wrapping this echo and it was not wrapped when it was delivered.but my family loves it.
23202,14,"i do not have this item but i am giving it a 1 star because i am deaf and this product does not benefit the deaf and hard of hearing community because it relies heavily on voice commands and such. since i can not hear or speak well enough verbally for me to use echo, it does not benefit me in any way other than having it as an expensive paper weight with flashy lights. with the advancement in technology, it amazes me that amazon would create a product that would exclude the deaf and hard of hearing community so i guess this is amazon is idea of making fun of the deaf and hard of hearing community. thanks amazon for the useless product that i will never ever get to use in my lifetime and my hearing friends and family members kept telling me that i have been missing out on a lot with this product. i appreciate it."
23203,14,"well, it seems alexa is pretty far left. so basically, screw it"
23204,14,"this thing is glorified spy/malware, only worse.  it is actually spying on you , not your computer.  unless you unplug it, you can not really be sure it is not listening to what is going on in your home.  sure there is a mute button for the mic on it, but ... well that can be software overridden.not only that, but when you ask a question, it gives the very left most liberal/pc view on the question that you ask.  (jesus christ is a fictional character, muhammad is the prophet etc.)  this and all the other listening devices should be removed from you home as soon as possible if you value your privacy."
23205,14,this device outputs highly biased information so you can not trust anything it tells you.
23206,14,"almost bought two of these for gifts, then found out ""alexa"" is historically ignorant, and i do not want my kids listening to false information.  alexa states that jesus christ is fictional.  alexa needs to educate itself, and alexa is handlers need to realize they will lose millions of sales for denying the proven existence of the man jesus christ, regardless of whether they believe he is the son of god.  sad and scary."
23207,14,alexa actually says that jesus christ was a fictional character. each one of them should be destroyed with a hammer!
23208,14,she told me jesus christ was a fictional character
23209,14,this is just a liberal tool complete with advertising.not in my house.lol
